Ye Muxi, stop!

Today's great great great golden chicken steak must be mine!

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,840
You wish. Friends can give in to anything but not this!

72
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,660
Xiaodong, what a coincidence!

73
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,240
Are you also going to buy chicken steak?

74
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,750
No. I'm being chased by fans.

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,440

[ Sold out ]

79
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,830
Why is it takes him so long?

80
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,950
Is he lost?

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,390
Why so late?

82
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,130
Here, take it. Eat.

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,960

00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,070
Okay. Okay.

85
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,130
Come, eat. Chicken steaks.

86
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,900
After she failed in the chicken steak race,

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,730
she didn't have lunch.

88
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,200
But kept doing this after she came back.

89
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,480
Just a chicken steak. Why so exaggerated?

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Just a chicken steak?

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,870
Just a chicken steak?

92
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,240

only fries ten great golden chicken steaks every day!

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,870
That outstanding flavor.

97
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,420

98
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,660
Why?

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,790
Why let me eat so delicious chicken steaks?!

100
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,990
Why?

101
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,140
Why I can't eat one today? Why?

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,960
I want chicken steaks.

103
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,920
Great chicken steaks. Family Bucket.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,460
Family Bucket...

105
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,770
Damn it. She's crazy.

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,760
No! Can't let this happen any more.

107
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,500
We must change the current situation!

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,140
The qualified score is fifty minutes and fourteen seconds.

109
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,530
School record, three minutes and eight seconds.

110
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,180
So my goal is within three minutes.

111
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,970
Chicken steak thief!

112
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,720
What?

113
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,670
You're Cheng Ling, right?

114
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,960
Yes.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,060
You're our monitor, Ye Muxi, right?

116
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,510
Yes.

117
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,020
Anything I can help with?

118
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,780
Today, I'm gonna tell you a story.

119
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,630
Called a dinosaur before pears.

120
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,580
Long long time ago, in the Jurassic Period,

121
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,270
there was a dinosaur family.

122
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,500
One day,

123
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,450
they found a pile of pears in the forest.

124
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,770
The considerate little dinosaur chose the smallest one.

125
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,890
But the smallest one was not a pear.

126
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,300
But a Fruit of Life passed down from ancient times.

127
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,480
So the little dinosaur turned into a tyrannosaurus in a second.

128
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,110
So, since then, it knew to share.

129
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm done.

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,140
What do you learn from this story?

131
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,480
Ye Muxi.

132
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,000
Actually I've heard of this story.

133
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,210
But it seems a little different from yours.

134
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,940
Anyway, it's not right for you
to have so many chicken steaks!

135
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,610
But... But...

136
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,480
But what?!

137
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,040
Tonight we gotta review lessons.
So the canteen is still open.

138
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,040
So,

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,530
I expect your performance.

140
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,890
Xinyi!

141
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,360
What's up?

142
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,710
I'm a student of Class Ten, Shen Wei.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,830
Class Ten? What can I do for you?

144
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,870
I know you're not only Class One's monitor,

145
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,500
but also the president of the Student Union,

146
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,710
in charge of societies and funding.

147
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,190
I want to apply for a society.

148
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,190
A society?

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,870
Astrology Society?

150
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,850
Yes.

151
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,540
It's about fortune telling, horoscope and dream interpreting.

152
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,630
No way!

153
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,450
Why?

154
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,180
Our school is a famous school.

155
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,180
How could we have such superstitions?

156
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,560
So, president, you only believe what you see, right?

157
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,190
Flip this onto this desk.

158
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,630
Haven three, Earth four.

159
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,720
It's about to happen soon.

160
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,150
What's about to happen?

161
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,830
Your love.

162
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,430
It shows that your true love will appear soon.

163
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,460
The way he appears is, on a colorful cloud.

164
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,170
Coming to you in a very impactive manner.

165
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,650
A colorful cloud?

166
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,730
So my true love is the Money King?

167
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,520
But it says so.

168
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,360
This is feudalistic superstition, totally nonsense.

169
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,180
I want one, too.

170
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,430

I'm not someone good at communicating.

And... But when I was in secondary school,

303
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,700
I realized if I ran errands for the others,

304
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,480
they would talk to me,

305
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,820
made friends with me,

306
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,670
and took me as one of them.

307
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,910
So I like running errands for them.

In fact, I'm the opposite of you.

309
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,960
In the past, I didn't like making friends.

making friends is not that complicated.

you don't need to be friends with every one.

The last one today.

342
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,990
There's no coins here.

343
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,750
How about we using this?

344
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,760
Do you have to be so casual?

345
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Is my fate so cheap?

346
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,380
Tell me, what's it this time?

347
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,980
Is he with a red silk strip?

348
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,980
Or on a colorful magical cattle?

349
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,260
Neither.

350
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,900
It's very simple this time.

351
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,670
It says,

352
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,970
your true love will kiss you today.

353
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,570
Impossible!

354
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,350
It shows that your true love will appear soon.

355
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,150
Your true love will walk on a fire wheel

356
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,670
and bump into you passionately.

357
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,260
It says,

358
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,390
your true love will kiss you today.

359
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,060
Anyway,

360
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,290
it's still too early to be kissed now.

361
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,570
No, it's totally unacceptable.

362
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,440
I decided. I'll stay in class today.

363
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,870
So Liao Danyi won't...

364
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,870
Guan Xinyi.

365
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,950
Liao Danyi, why did you come here?

366
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,090
-I'm here for you.
-Stay where you are!

367
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,930
Let me explain it.

368
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,740
Stay where you are.

369
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,220
Let me explain it.

370
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,110
Stay away from me.

371
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,210
Let me explain it.

372
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,930
I've thought it through. If I can't defeat you,

373
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,820
you shall join us.

374
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,150
Cheng Ling

375
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,780
Join our class committee?

376
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,780
A committee member?

377
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,730
I can't.

378
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,350
You can!

379
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,580
You have an advantage over the others.

380
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,020
What's that?

381
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,180
Advantage? I have no advantages.

382
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,310
Come on. Let's go.

383
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,650
Why did it get locked?

384
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,620
Stay away from me!

385
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,350
Stay away from me.

386
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,560
I don't know why.

387
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,810
You're like a magnet today.

388
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,810
I bump into you every time I see you.

389
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,980
But I'm here only to apologize to you.

390
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,070
Why did you come for me?

391
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,680
Why did you approach me?

392
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,840
That's irresistible.

393
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,840
How could it be irresistible every time?

394
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,030
If it's not, then what is it?

395
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,410
Could be many reasons!

396
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,970
For example, kismet.

397
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,430
Fate...

398
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,480
Don't look at me.

399
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Don't look at me!

400
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,850
Calm down.

401
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,560
Calm down!

402
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,970
Calm down.

403
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,790
Okay.

404
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,960
The door is opened.

405
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,560
The door is opened.

406
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,040
How did you run yesterday?

407
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,040
No idea.

408
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,420
Well, which place did you get?

409
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,200
The first place.

410
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,370
The first place. How about you?

411
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,430
What can I do for you?

412
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,170
Race.

413
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,860
You're a girl. A race with me?

414
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,650
I find a very good sport man in our class.

415
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,160
But he's not in your team.

416
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,370
Who's that talented man?

417
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
Him. Cheng Ling.

418
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,120
Hi, everyone.

419
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,860
You're short. Can you really do this?

420
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,020
Believe me, you're gonna be shocked.

421
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,200
Give it a try, then. Come on.

422
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,850
Everybody.

423
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,990
Ready?

424
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,840
Go!

425
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,460
Where are you going?

426
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,230
Cheng Ling! Cheng Ling!

427
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,890
The canteen is right ahead!

428
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,560
Chicken steaks! Hurry!

429
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
Cheng Ling, you're so amazing!

430
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,820
Cheng Ling, I knew you can do this!

431
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,500
Boy, you run so fast.

432
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,880
Join our track and field team?

433
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,620
Yes, so amazing.

434
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,290
The relay race next week is counting on you.

435
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,700
Hey, Cheng Ling, what's wrong with you?

436
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
We've been waiting for a whole morning.

437
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,460
Where are our chicken steaks?

438
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,020
He's a member of our team now. What's the matter?

439
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,460
Where are our chicken steaks?

440
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,950
What's the matter?

441
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,540
Nothing. Just an acquaintance.

442
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,120
Just come to say hello.

443
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,730
So, Cheng Ling,

444
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,730
do you want to join our team?

445
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,260
Okay.

446
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,260
I like running.

447
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,360
Is it really so simple?

448
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,630
Gimme.

449
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,270
Sorry. I apologize for what I did.

450
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,870
Okay.

451
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,270
So simple?

452
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,960
Of course. You think I'm very narrow-minded?

453
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,510
But, to apologize,

454
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,060
you should offer me something like you do now.

455
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,720
I shall leave first if there's noting else.

456
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,520
Hey, come back.

457
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,050
I ordered the chocolate flavor.

458
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,430
Why did you buy me a plain one?

459
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,720
It's chocolate.

460
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,170
Have a taste.

461
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,380
I'm really sorry. I'll buy you another cup.

462
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,520
This guy doesn't seem that bad.

463
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,740
Well, is this an indirect kiss?

464
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,310
President, you scared me.

465
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,620
What's this?

466
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,870
Approval for foundation of your society.

467
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,640
Well.

468
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,110
You didn't know I would give you this

469
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,410
at such a moment?

470
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,780
So, president.

471
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,780
You also believe in kismet now?

472
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,580
What nonsense is that?

473
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,690
I never believe in anything like kismet.
