Guys.

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,570
I think you've already known that Liao Danyi

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,500
sent me a message today.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,090
He says, a date?

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,200
I wanna know what that means.

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,950
Your majesty.

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,370
A date refers to all activities

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,360
that young people do when hanging out together.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,710
To be specific, eat meals,

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,110
see movies,

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,730
walk on the street and other sensitive activities.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,350
Liao Danyi... That's impossible.

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,140
Your majesty, Liao Danyi now is a rutting adolescent.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,430
Won't let go of any girls around him.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,140
Well, how should I reply?

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,200
Your majesty.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,420
I think you may reply as ' a date about what' ?

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,090
Good idea.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,570
Okay.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,160
A date about what?

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,980
He replies.

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,140
He says, dining, XOXO.

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,380
XOXO?

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,970
Bad intentions! So obvious!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,040
Shameless!

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,750
So, I reply as...

30
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,150
Of course no!

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,910
No.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,920
Your majesty, if you give in right now,

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,920
it hurts your stateliness.

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,070
Your majesty, even if it's a trap,

35
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,440
you should go anyway!

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,860
Your majesty, say yes.

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,090
Then, okay is my reply.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,170
Okay.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,450
He says, looking forward to that.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,710
Your majesty, I have an idea.

41
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,040
How about you send him ellipses as your reply?

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,690
Good.

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,490
E... Ellipses.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,900
He sends me a smiling face.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,540
This...

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,830
Your majesty.

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,250
You can send him a contemptuous look.

48
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,610
Saying you're going to take a shower.

49
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,620
This is the best way to end a talk.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,950
He says, good night, hope I can dream of you.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,790
This...

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,610
Damn it. Damn it.

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,860
This talk can't be ended.

54
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,290
What should I do?

55
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,460
Your majesty, I have an idea.

56
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,810
At such a moment, you only need to send him one word.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Then all problems will be solved.

58
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,420
What's that?

59
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,770

64
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,710
Listen to me.

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,810
I won't be afraid of you at tonight's dinner!

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,550
Dinner? With whom?

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,560
Didn't you send messages to me that we'll dine together?

68
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,280
Messages? My account was hacked.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,570
You don't know that?

70
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,910
He cheats people of money everywhere in my name.

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,190
I've told everyone.

72

Before class,

138
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,180
the monitor should lead the other students to say

good morning, teacher.

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,700
To show the basic respect for the teacher.

141

You know?

Fine. I'm used to that.

What is this attitude?! Are you asking for trouble?

147

No.

I just... Hold this attitude to all the teachers.

Good. Very good.

150
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,470
Take your chair with you. Stand outside!

151
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,120
Don't believe I can't put you under control.

152

Take your chair with you.

Sorry, teacher.

I think it's not right to punish students in this way.

What a knight!

158

If not, I'm gonna say more.

I'm gonna restate a few requirements before class.

First, don't look around during the class!

166

Once found, outside.

167
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,670
Second,

168
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,200
during the class, don't whisper to each other.

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,300
Once found, outside!

170
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,630
Outside!

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,380
Outside! Outside! Outside!

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,670
Only you behave yourself.

173
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,820
Listen,

174
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,030
For anything,

175
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,230
no rules, no gains!

176
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,720
Okay. Let's start the class now.

177
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,870
Big boss, I need help.

178
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,200
Me, too. Big boss.

179
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,950
What?

180
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,950
Can't stand it any more.

181
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,670
I'm dying.

182
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,210
So what? I can't stand it for you.

183
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,040
Can't stand it any more. What should I do?

184
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,360
What are you looking at?

185
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,890
Are you guys in a PE class?

186
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,070
If not,

187
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,970
why you all stand outside?

188
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,580
Because...

189
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,890
They're being punished!

190
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,090
Monitor of Class Ten, you're such a good example!

191
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,200
Such a class is really not suitable for

192
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,580
a good student like Liao Danyi, huh?

193
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,560
Yes.

194
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,070
What did you mean?

195
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,620
You'll figure it out.

196
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,960
Let's go.

197
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,330
I hate students of Class One the most!

198
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,660
Why so arrogant?

199
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,350
Yes!

200
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,920
Back to your spot!

201
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,640
I was not angry.

202
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Before you said that!

203
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,340
Emperor Yao wanted to give his empire to Xu You.

204
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,980
Xu You declined.

205
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,150
Emperor Shun wanted to give his throne to Zizhou Zhibo.

206
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,840
Zizhou Zhibo replied...

207
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,180
Mr. Wu, what a good mood!

208
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,450
Miss Luo, class is over?

209
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,100
Hurry, go check up on your class.

210
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,400
What's wrong with my class?

211
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,570
All your students are standing outside the classroom.

212
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,570
Don't you feel ashamed?

213
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,810
What?

214
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,620
Do I have to repeat that?

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,610
Put it down, all of you.

216
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,260
Which one of your dares to?

217
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,590
Director Yan.

218
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,330
Isn't it improper?

219
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,150
On which aspect?

220
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,990
The students in your class

221
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,710
don't know have to behave in class.

222
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,410
I tell them to reflect on themselves outside.

223
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,480
To think about their mistakes.

224
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,480
Director Yan.

225
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,610
Now it's not your class time.

226
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,460
The next class is mine.

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,970
I want my students to go back preparing for it.

228
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,610
Any problem?

229
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,900
See how your monitor behaves now?

230
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,570
Mr. Wu...

231
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,460
-You... You...
-Inside!

232
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,340
You're going against me in public.

233
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,880
What do you want?

234
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,830
Teach students according to their aptitude, you know?

235
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,830
Adopt different teaching methods before different students.

236
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,080
For students like them,

237
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,380
you should make them do some thinking outside!

238
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,500
To cherish our school.

239
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,770
And the wonderful time on campus.

240
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,810
Director Yan.

241
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,270
You've made they standing here for forty-five minutes.

242
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,480
I don't know what on earth have they got?

243
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,920
Wu,

244
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,920
mind your talking attitude to me.

245
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,710
Anyway,

246
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,300
I will never agree to any psychical punishment like this.

247
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,590
Fine.

248
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,260
Facts.

249
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,690
Talk to me again based on some facts!

250
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,710
-Teacher...
-You scared me.

251
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,910
Cool! So cool!

252
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,530
Am I?

253
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,550
Yes. Cool.

254
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,930
Call me Wu Sir, then.

255
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,580
Yes, Wu Sir!

256
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,290
Let's go.

257
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,620
Go. Yes.

258
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,370
Liao Danyi.

259
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,220
What's the matter?

260
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,960
Liao Danyi,

261
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
why are you eating alone here?

262
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,480
It seems that you haven't made any friends in this class.

263
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,480
I just like eating alone.

264
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,070
Really?

265
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,070
I think it's because

266
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,070
you've realized you're not the same with them.

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,930
Have you filled in the Class Transfer Application?

268
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,500
Liao Danyi.

269
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,250
I know you're good in study.

270
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,250
But what are you hesitating about?

271
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,550
Such a good chance.

272
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,430
I don't know what makes Miss Xinyi love...

273
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,640
You've said too much.

274
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,580
Got it.

275
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,760
Liao Danyi.

276
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,290
I still hope you can transfer into our class.

277
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,790
Hope you can think about that.

278
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,200
Where are you going?

279
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
Suddenly I feel that I have no appetite.

280
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,690
Want to eat in some other place.

281
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,300
Why are you here?

282
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,110
Where's your master?

283
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,630
Want to eat some?

284
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,990
I can feed you.

285
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,910
I'm Liao Danyi. What's your name?

286
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,200
Did you smell something?

287
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,610
Me, too.

288
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,130
What's going on?

289
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,990
Hot pot?

290
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,160
What are you doing here?

291
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,690
Having lunch.

292
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,950
Meat.

293
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,570
Who is this?

294
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,960
Seems to be someone's pet.

295
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,570
Speaking of that, in normal cases,

296
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,140
have you seen anyone taking a hot pot into school as lunch?

297
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,540
Any problem?

298
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,050
No.

299
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't help it.

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,690
Hot pot is so delicious, isn't it?

301
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,540
Listen,

302
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,000
the hot pot inventor is so crime-ridden.

303
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,890
People can't stand any other food once they've eaten hot pot.

304
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,190
Don't you think so?

305
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,040
Xiaotian, you gotta take a shower anyway!

306
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,550
Runs away again.

307
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,210
Sorry!

308
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,830
My hot pot!

309
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,970
Xiaotian?

310
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,390
Yes, that's his name.

311
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,390
I'm so useless.

312
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,750
Let him run away again.

313
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,750
He's the protector at girls' dormitory!

314
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,750
Can we have dogs in school?

315
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,400
What are you doing?

316
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,420
Still have some water in my ear.

317
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,150
He's not just a dog.

318
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,710
In the past, he was a star's guide dog.

319
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,960
But he retired after his master died.

320
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,230
It's said that he's being taken care of by Mrs. dorm manager.

321
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,090
A guide dog? So awesome!

322
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,090
But you...

323
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,790
Trying to bathe him. He's too dirty!

324
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
Director Yan says, if not,

325
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,200
he'll be sent into the animal sanctuary.

326
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,530
How could he do that?!

327
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,970
Most dogs don't like bathing.

328
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,560
If only someone could help him with that.

329
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,940
How about this, I got this.

330
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,690
He's very agile.

331
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,240
It's not a easy job.

332
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,580
Me, monitor of Class Ten, will do.

333
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,270
Any direct connection to that?

334
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,560
Really? Thank you.

335
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,540
So, about this matter,

336
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,180
I will put it in a simple way.

337
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,210
You'll get some fruit and a brush.

338
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,790
To stop him running away,

339
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,460
you should hold him tight.

340
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,260
And stay with me like my follower.

341
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,710
Then watch me bathe him.

342
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,850
