1
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,580
Damn it. That stupid driver hits another car.

2
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,570
Sir, I'm really sorry. Sorry.

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,470
It's all my fault!

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,470
I'll be responsible for all of this. Okay?

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,630
Miss Guan might be late because of this.

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,880
What could I do?

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,570
I'm about to be late!

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,580
I can only run to school.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,620
Isn't that Liao Danyi?

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,080
He's also so late.

[ Maple Leaf Middle School ]

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,350
In this case,

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,280
am I gonna run into school
at the same time with him?

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,550
So other students will see us running together?

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,540
They will gossip, right?

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,120
They'll make guesses about our relationship.

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,640
If that happens,

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,320
we'll give it a try and date?

19
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,570
Then we'll stay together forever?

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,260
Annoying. Why are you thinking so much?

21
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,440
Now, one step at a time.

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,850
Since all people know it,

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,290
how about we...

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,950
First, run into school together.

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,280
As long as I catch up with him. Catch up with him.

26
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,720
Catch up with him.

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,910
Catch up with him.

28
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,370
He runs so fast!

Episode 09

59
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,920
There's confusion in your eyes.

60
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,180
You must feel very confused deep down.

61
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,830
Spit it out.

62
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,610
Big Long.

63
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm Wolong.

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,530
I'm already crouching here.
You still don't know my name?

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,270
Get me up.

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,170
Why?

67
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,500
I can't get up by myself.

68
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,310
Thank you.

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,460
What's the matter? Shoot.

70
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,640
I want you to do me a favor.

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,650
Just ask me for help.
I want you to do me a favor.

72
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,140
Just ask me for help.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,540
I'll tell you everything I know.

74
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,470
Shut up, animal.

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,240
You empty big head. What idea do you have?

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
To help her out?

77
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,720
My head is big?

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
Do you remember that day...

79
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm here! Coming.

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Yezi is not calling you. But me.

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,240
Me. Me.

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,950
I've lived for hundreds of years.

83
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,510
That's my first time to see
someone being pulled down by his head.

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,350
You gotta be kidding me!

85
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,790
Wonder girl, you know?

86
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,800
That day, he was doping off.

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,060
I'm stuck.

88
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,340
He... He still pretended being calm.

89
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,190
You big headed giant baby!

90
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,230
You big headed mongolism!

91
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,230
You big headed loser!

92
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,650
You big headed idiot!

93
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,370
Think about it.

94
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,880
Aren't we both big headed?

95
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,610
It seems that you're useless.

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,290
Gotta erase you two.

97
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,520
Wait. Wait. Wait.

98
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,190
Just tell us what's the matter.

99
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes.

100
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,220
Today, I got a crime mystery.

101
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,970
Can't figure it out.

102
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,970
I really want to now who's the criminal!

103
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,310
Easy. Let me do some calculation.

104
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,210
Then I'll tell you the truth.

105
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,360
Those thick and short fingers can do calculation?

106
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,900
Don't judge everything by appearance.

107
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,150
Don't judge people by their looks.

108
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,500
The society really has changed.

109
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,520
All based on face value.

110
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,990
Okay. Okay. My fault.

111
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,990
Heroes, please get down to business.

112
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,580
What I'm gonna tell you is,

113
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,450
now the undercurrent is flowing.

114
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,450
Don't be panic.

115
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,390
Let reproduce the crime scene.

116
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,200
Look, this is almost a masterpiece!

117
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,040
Yes, a white wall changed overnight.

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,470
Awesome.

119
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,680
What are you guys doing here?

120
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,110
Class Ten of Grade Ten!

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,720
Don't you know the use of a blackboard newspaper?

122
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,770
To show your class's features and virtues.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,480
And this is your class's features and virtues, right?

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,870
Who did this? Who painted this? Stand out.

125
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,930
We still don't know who did this.

126
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,640
Fine. You better not let me know who did this.

127
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,860
Erase it, right now, at once!

128
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,140
Because of someone's prank,

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,430
Our class's qualification for
the blackboard newspaper race gets canceled.

130
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,000
But, never mind.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,360
If that one wants to admit his or her mistake,

132
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,550
please come to me.

133
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,120
But if you don't,

134
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,830
you may come to me privately.

135
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,660
I won't blame you for that.

136
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm not strict with anyone.

137
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,050
I'm quite liberal.

138
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,430
Unlike someone.

139
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,080
Commissary in charge of studies,
although he's not our monitor...

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,380
This is obviously painted by monitor herself.

141
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,510
Ye Muxi.

142
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,450
I know you're very ambitious.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,820
But to write a chapter of your life

144
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,380
is not to do graffiti art on school's white walls.

145
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,280
What?

146
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,780
Graffiti on our school's white walls, is not yours?

147
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,910
No. How could it be possible?

148
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,140
But that's your painting style.

149
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,230
No.

150
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,000
Many students tell me, that's definitely your work.

151
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,130
No. You really get me wrong.

152
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,950
Look, this is my painting style.

153
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,760
Totally different from those on the wall.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Indeed different.

155
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Why on the Chinese textbook?

156
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,930
Ye Muxi.

157
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,510
When you're in my class,

158
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,720
Ye Muxi, what were you doing?

159
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,110
Why did you do this to me?

160
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,450
Anyway, I didn't paint that.

161
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,640
And, I'm the monitor.

162
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
I'll find the criminal. Rest easy.

163
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,610
Explain this to me.

164
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

165
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,090
Come back!

166
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm on it!

167
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,980
Come back. Come back.

168
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,410
Make it clear to me.

169
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,990
How does it go?

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,010
Still no one confesses to you?

171
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,030
I've been sitting there for a whole day.

172
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,130
Waiting and waiting.

173
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,140
No one comes to me.

174
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,790
I'm not surprised.

175
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,300
I really don't get it.

176
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm so merciful, so cute.

177
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,330
And so nice.

178
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
Why no one confesses to me?

179
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,730
It seems that I can only take that one as a criminal,

180
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,730
rather than my fellow student.

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,070
I've read so many detective novels since I was a child.

182
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,010
Now it'll finally come  handy!

183
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,200
Watch me solve this problem perfectly.

184
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,760
You're not wearing glasses.

185
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,390
Why touch imaginary rims?

186
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,180
Let's start a brilliant deduction.

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,450
Now we're the suspect.

188
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,570
If we want to enter this crime scene,

189
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,240
we can only get in by the door.

190
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,420
But according to our deduction,

191
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,540
the door wasn't locked at that time.

192
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,430
Because once this kind of door gets locked,

193
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,670
it can only be opened by the key.

194
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,720
Well, what time is it now?

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,200
We can also know the crime time through deduction.

196
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,380
Either in daytime or at night.

197
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,800
And the criminal's gender...

198
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,740
Can also be known through deduction.

199
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,330
Either boy or girl.

200
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,100
There's also a third possibility.

201
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,500
Now, let's look at this crime fact.

202
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,450
It seems that there's only one
kind of handwriting on the blackboard.

203
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,820
So the criminal suspect is only one person?

204
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,130
Wait.

205
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,980
I have got a bold guess.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,810
This is probably a gang crime.

207
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,180
One kind of handwriting is to confuse the others.

208
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,570
Right.

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,360
Is it possible that two people
worked together to finish this graffiti?

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,780
The first one finished the first half of it.

211
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
While the second one imitated the first one's handwriting

212
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,990
to finish the rest of it?

213
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,830
To my knowledge, in Class Ten,

214
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,290
the only gang whose members are close partners,

215
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,000
includes two people.

216
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,220

Shouldn't be.

You never had resistance to hot pot.

222

No. I've been thinking about something.

But can't figure it out.

224
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,290
So I feel very upset.

225
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,090
That's not right.

A colorful cloud?

So my true love is the Money King?

Nothing?

Sorry. Sorry.

341
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,840
You're the criminal!

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,160
That's because you're stupid.
You can't find out the criminal.

343
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,620
Find out a criminal for me, then. Come on.

344
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,600
Come with me.

345
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,060
What?

346
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,690
Only two girls in our class love cartoon books.

347
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,150
Except for you, only into inspiring cartoons,

348
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,370
Another girl,

349
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,540
Yuan Ke'er, always sits in the corner,

350
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,240
only into dark cartoons.

351
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,370
If you know a little about every student in our class,

352
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,840
you'll know, she's the only student talented in art.

353
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,440
Only she can draw such an exquisite blackboard newspaper.

354
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,130
You know that again? You have no evidence.

355
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,540
What she's drawing now is

356
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,440
the same as what's on the blackboard.

357
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,020
Next to it, is the spray can for the graffiti.

358
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,060
It's been placed there for a few days.

359
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,000
Only some idiot can't notice that.

360
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,080
What did you mean?

361
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,770
Yuan Ke'er, did you really paint that?

362
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,040
Didn't expect you would find this.

363
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,620
Why?

364
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,630
What are you doing? She...

365
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,150
Obviously.

366
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,900
She doesn't wanna talk with us.

367
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,880
Even you go ask her, she won't tell you anything.

368
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
Liao Danyi.

369
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,040
Sooner or later,

370
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,600
you'll be one of our class.

371
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,480
What are you doing with your candid camera?

372
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm the sanitation supervisor of our grade this week.

373
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm commanded to record some labor work.

374
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,260
Look, your class.

375
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,880
How messy it is!

376
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,560
It seems that I should focus my patrol on your class.

377
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,860
Okay. Shoot your video.

378
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,020
I'll go clean it up. Camera on me.

379
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,710
No. No. No. I better shoot videos about Liao Danyi.

380
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,790
Where's Liao Danyi?

381
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,410
He must have finished this and go to the library.

382
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,760
Why him? Just put your camera on me!

383
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,850
Here. Look at this.

384
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm good at cleaning work.

385
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm really good at this.

386
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,600
I've practiced this.

387
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,030
One. Two. Three. Four.

388
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,600
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

389
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,910
Two. Two. Three. Four.

390
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,440
Five. Six. Seven...

391
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,930
Working so hard? Have some water.

392
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,780
Dad.

393
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,920
Why did you come in without knocking?

394
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,340
What are you busy with lately? Looks so tiring.

395
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,920
The Student Union tells me to do

396
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,950
a figure investigation and study. Quite busy.

397
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay. Keep going.

398
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,200
I should leave you alone here.

399
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,590
I need another try.

400
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,030
It came true again, right?

401
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,030
Your turn.

402
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,260
It says,

403
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,110
your true love will kiss you today.

404
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,440
Calm down.

405
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,880
Calm down!

406
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,700
Hey.

407
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,810
The door is opened.

408
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,610
The door is opened.

409
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,070
I'm really sorry.

410
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,070
I apologize for what I did.

411
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,640
Okay.

412
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,640
I shall leave first if there's noting else.

413
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,430
Hey, come back.

414
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,500
I ordered the chocolate flavor.

415
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,910
Why did you buy me a plain one?

416
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,060
Well, is this an indirect kiss?

417
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,230
Since that,

418
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,150
I shall give you a chance to love me.

419

[ Cold Jokes ]

420
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,350
Meijing, have you heard of that joke?

421
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,250
There's an onion.

422
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,450
When it's walking, walking,

423
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,900
and walking,

424
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,690
it bursts into tears.

425
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,200
Well, how about that joke?

426
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,870
There's a male deer.

427
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,260
When it's running and running on the road,

428
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,610
it turns into an express male.

429
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,990
Well, have you heard of that joke?

430
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,380
A fatty falls off the stairs accidentally.

431
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,020
Then becomes a dead fatty.

432
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,740
Let's go to the library.

433
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Okay.

434
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,750
Do you wanna hear jokes?

435
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,670
What a freak.
