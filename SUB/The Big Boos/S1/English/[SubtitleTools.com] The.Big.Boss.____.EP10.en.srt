Episode 10

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,590
Use this on director Yan.

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,080
Crumb it, put it in director Yan's mug.

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,280
Let's go.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,960
Si Mayi is so handsome.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,310
I couldn't quit it.

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,330
Wish I can stay at home to watch it everyday.

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,870
Monitor of Class Ten.

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,200
What're are you doing here?

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm here as the president of the Student Union

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,990
to let you know that because
you've recovered your blackboard newspaper

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,800
and teacher Wu Heng pleaded with the headmaster.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,890
So the headmaster decides to give you a chance

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,140
to participate in the blackboard newspaper competition.

44
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,360
Good luck.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
But to be honest.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,620
There's no much point.

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,130
After all, Class One will win the champion.

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,040
What... What do you mean?

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,690
We're also very good.

50
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,690
Nothing really.

51
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,430
It's just... You won't win.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,410
What on heck?!

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,250
Ignore them.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,360
We're awesome!

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,490
We have so many talented classmates.

56
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,240
Right.

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,910
Yes, they can get high scores.

58
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,070
It's not certain that will apply to the blackboard newspaper!

59
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,100
All the top art talent students are all in Class One.

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,080
Of course they're good.

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
It's nothing really.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,430
Come with me later.

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,640
What for?

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,590
To spy on our enemy.

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,870
Class one wins the championship every year.

66
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,090
This year, I bet they're good also.

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,660
I don't believe they will win this time.

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,550
They're just some bookworms.

69
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,960
How good that can be?!

70
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,140
It's too professional.

71
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,170
It's a foul to be that professional.

72
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,810
Senior high school students are not like that!

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,920
I didn't know Class One is so good.

74
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,730
We can't underestimate them.

75
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,340
Look, let's settle a theme for our blackboard newspaper first.

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,070
Well, any ideas?

77
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,790
Boss, how about this?

78
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,390
We'll draw the Arena of Valor: 5v5 Arena Game.

79
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,610
Up-way, mid-way, down-way.

80
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,150
Red buff, blue buff, big and little dragons.

81
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,920
Draw them all.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,100
We'll definitely defeat them!

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,460
[ Victory ]

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,690
Big boss, feel that? That's it!

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,390
So interesting. Okay?

86
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,190
Right, another idea.

87
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,900
Death, Naruto, One Piece.

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,390
Uzumaki Naruto with Monkey D Luffy. Blood boiling youth!

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,340
Monitor, understand?

90
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,540
I think... Music.

91
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,990
We use music elements blend with fashion elements.

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,850
We'll be surely outstanding!

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,670
I think the theme can be a fairy story about a prince and a princess.

94
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,960
My princess, me and my horse

95
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,300
come here to pick you up.

96
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,870
You're so beautiful.

97
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,450
My prince, have you noticed that

98
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,820
your horse is a little different from the other horses.

99
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm a horse.

100
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,240
Don't say that.

101
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,290
When he was young.

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,420
The others laughed at him a lot because of that.

103
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,280
Actually, he is quite cute.

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,140
I'm a horse.

105
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,830
I'm a horse.

106
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,690
I'm a horse.

107
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,090
Cute. Look. See?

108
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,760
Cute.

109
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,760
I think we're students.

110
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,290
We should focus on study.

111
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,240
How about we draw an encyclopedia poster?

112
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,730
You're such a dull.

113
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,540
I think it's not enough.

114
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,890
Yuan Ke'er is much better than us together.

115
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,870
If Yuan Ke'er can draw something not so strange.

116
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,430
We'll win the first place.

117
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,250
I don't believe we adding up together won't beat Yuan Ke'er.

118
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,650
It's true.

119
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,900
Union is strength.

120
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,290
We must trust each other.

121
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,010
How about this, use this blackboard as an experiment.

122
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,240
Draw whatever in our thoughts.

123
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,910
I believe it will be wonderful, okay?

124
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,110
Okay, I agree.

125
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,920
Monitor, you know what?

126
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,160
I started to learn painting since I was four.

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,050
Don't underestimate me.

128
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,910
I know you didn't see that in me usually.

129
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,600
How should we put it?

130
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
It feels...

131
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,850
very fashionable.

132
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,850
Cool.

133
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
It's so ugly, gosh!

134
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,620
How could it be so terrible?!

135
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,970
Without Yuan Ke'er.

136
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,760
We're screwed, totally screwed you know?

137
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,880
Where're you going?

138
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,560
Monitor, it's late.

139
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,270
We're gonna go home to do our homework.

140
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,530
Go for it, monitor.

141
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,770
We'll definitely win!

Looking forward to the competition. Bye.

143
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,570
You're just gonna give up?

00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,750
What shall we do?

145
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,900
It's a competition.

146
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,250
Since we're in.

147
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,840
We'll do our best.

148
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,990
What other choices do you have?

149
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,780
Do it on your own.

Recently, one of our classmates haven't showed up for days.

168

That student is Yuan Ke'er.

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,810
Shen Wei did some research.

171
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,800
Please.

172
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,250
The blackboard newspaper competition is about to begin.

173
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,100
Ke'er is still missing.

174
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,720
I've done some research last night.

175
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,930
And listed all the suspicious persons and organizations on this paper.

176
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,140
Please pass around.

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,460
Shen Wei is right.

178
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,140
But the reason we need to find her
is not because of the competition.

179
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,950
It is because that she is our classmate.

180
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,250
What is Demon Dancing Group?

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,530
Sounds so scary!

182
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,500
Demon Dancing Group is the most famous organization nearby.

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,830
They occupy the square, public sitting area forcibly.

184
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,600
They make loud noise.

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,260
And dance in the square day and night.

186
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,720
You mean the square dancing ladies?

187
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,600
Kill& Punishment Duo?

188
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,330
What? Let me see.

189
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,370
Kill& Punishment Duo

190
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,730
are the cunning old fox Liu Laoliu

191
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,100
and the calm owl Wang Shisan.

192
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,170
A super intelligence combination.

193
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,570
They occupy the pavilions and benches on the streets

194
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,650
to play poker and chess.

195
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,930
And they always make people play with them.

196
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,710
You mean the old poker players?

197
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,700
What are those strange names?

198
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,550
Liberation Streets' Front

199
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,750
Those guys like to dance hip-hop

200
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,670
play music and skateboard etc.

201
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,690
Not some scary groups.

202
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,640
Any problem?

203
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,270
Don't you think this is the most suspicious one?

204
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,400
Welcome to our place. Anything we can help with?

205
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,870
We're students from Class Ten, Grade One.

206
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,990
I'm Ye Muxi.

207
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
I heard there's a student called Yuan Ke'er.

208
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,310
We're here to see her.

209
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,390
Yuan Ke'er?

210
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,150
Never met her.

211
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,560
Don't lie to us.

212
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,730
I know she is in here. Hand her out.

213
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,280
You mean I lied?

214
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,900
No.

215
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,840
But we know she is here.

216
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,540
So please cooperate.

217
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,010
It's not a place for kids. Leave now.

218
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,840
If you don't hand her out today,

219
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,540
this will not be over today.

220
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,910
This is your place but mine as well.

221
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,570
We are not leaving, neither can you.

222
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,450
We're young hooligans.

223
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,050
We're young hooligans.

224
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,930
You want to take over this place?

225
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,390
Show me what have you gotten.

226
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,050
Come on, come on.

227
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,570
We don't want any trouble.

228
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,590
That's it? Right.

229
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
Boss, they're brothers, Huang Nan and Huang Yi.

230
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,930
I didn't know you two are quite famous.

231
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,890
Are you kidding me?

232
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,280
No one can beat me in this.

233
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,230
I didn't expect that truly.

234
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
But next,

235
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,350
I don't think you can handle it.

236
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,230
Black, you go.

237
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,120
What do you want?

238
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,830
What do you expect?

239
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,630
Ready?

240
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,010
Come on baby.

241
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,020
Wrapping head type.

242
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,670
Kicking type.

243
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,250
Waist type.

244
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,270
Waist circle type.

245
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,050
Marshmallow yepe.

246
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,920
Wrapping head type.

247
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,090
Three times left, three times right.

248
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,920
Dance battle.

249
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,610
Come on, come on.

250
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,260
Stage pose at last!

251
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,080
Scared?

252
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,940
How is that?

253
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,720
Black is our best hip-hop dancer here.

254
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,280
Xiaodong. Go.

255
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,120
So what? Hooligans are brave fighters.

256
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
This is nothing.

257
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,610
Let me show you what are true bros.

258
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,250
Hand!

259
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:34,890
What're you doing?

260
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,670
Do you trust me?

261
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,360
I don't!

262
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,120
Trust me!

263
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,140
Ye Muxi!

264
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,700
My hand. My hand!

265
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,960
Ye Muxi. No, no!

266
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,470
My hand.

267
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,700
My test papers.

268
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,690
My future. My future.

269
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,580
This is family.

270
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,450
I don't know you can trust each other with your future.

271
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,600
Anyone else?

272
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,920
No, right?

273
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,890
Ke'er. I know you're in there.

274
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,340
No matter what. We have something to tell you.

275
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,420
Right, Ke'er. Come out.

276
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,210
Come out. Ke'er.

277
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,980
So come out.

278
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,100
Come out, Ke'er.

279
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,020
Ke'er. I don't know why.

280
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,560
But I remember when you first came to our school.

281
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,930
You're such an innocent, cute and good girl.

282
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,980
But I don't know what happened to you.

283
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,590
to make you changed and stay in this place.

284
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,730
Tell me, did anyone do anything to you?

285
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,790
Who bullied you? I'll make him apologize to you.

286
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,680
Trust me. Tell us.

287
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,680
What do you know?

288
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,050
When she came to school,

289
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,540
she was a girl with a big dream.

290
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,130
But your classmate told her,

291
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,510
what she drew was nothing but garbage.

292
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,700
That makes her become like this.

293
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,840
Who is that? So bold!

294
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,560
Tell me.

295
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,730
Who? Who said that?

296
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,910
-Right.
-who's that? Tell us.

297
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,130
That classmate is your monitor.

298
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,120
Repeat that.

299
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,350
That classmate is your monitor.

300
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,560
Give me a second.

301
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,580
Come.

302
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,320
Do you have something to tell us about that?

303
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,770
I don't know.

304
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,470
It's just...

305
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,950
I believe you. You can do it!

306
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,200
What the heck?

307
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,730
That's our blackboard newspaper!

308
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,900
I can't live with that. Wipe it off.

309
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,450
I quit!

310
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,920
That....about the blackboard newspaper...

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,820
Her picture doesn't fit it.

312
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,190
So I told her to wipe it.

313
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,380
It's easy, you go apologize to her.

314
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,540
I agree.

315
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,760
She is not that kind of type to apologize.

316
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
Why? Why I'm not that type?

317
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
You won't apologize to her.

318
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,290
I will apologize. Who said I won't?

319
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,970
Do you remember when you were young?

320
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,410
What? when?

321
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
When you were three, you did something wrong.

322
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
What? I apologized.

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,750
I apologized back then.

324
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,730
- Did you?
- Yes.

325
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,990
- You didn't
- I did.

326
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,550
- You never apologized
- I also apologized at five.

327
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,500
- In primary school
- I apologized for all of that.

328
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,260
In primary school you snatched my schoolbag.

329
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,360
What?

330
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,260
You scrawled on my book.

331
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,960
Right, but I apologized.

332
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
- In middle school
- I apologized.

333
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,360
You never apologized.

334
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,070
I did.

335
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,170
You never apologized.

336
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,620
- I apologized at five
- No, you didn't.

337
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,460
Fine, fine, fine. I'll go apologize.

338
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,150
Let's go.

339
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,900
Yuan Ke'er.

340
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,960
Our monitor Ye Muxi has something to tell you.

341
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,040
Say it out.

342
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,000
Louder.

343
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,630
Louder.

345
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,190
I'm sorry...

346
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,150
Say it!

347
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,850
Turn around!

348
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,030
Stand still.

349
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,390
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,410
In Chinese.

351
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,300
Say it properly.

352
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,440
Can't hear you.

354
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,870
Hurry.

355
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,820
Wanna muddle through?

356
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,890
So...sorry.

357
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,090
Louder.

358
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,000
So...sorr...

359
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,770
Lost your voice? Hurry.

360
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,970
I'm sorry!

361
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,570
Why did you apologize to me?

362
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,670
Because I said your picture is not good.

363
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,140
So do you think it's beautiful now?

364
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,600
I always think it's beautiful.

365
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,400
It's just I don't know how to appreciate it.

366
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,390
Now you think Class Ten needs me?

367
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,370
We need you. So...

368
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,220
Come back to Class Ten.

369
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,800
Okay.

370
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,000
You think I'm just gonna let you take her away that easily?

371
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,290
Why don't you let her go?

372
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,240
Because she is only pretty girl in here.

373
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,400
What do you mean?

374
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Sorry, just being honest.

375
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,390
What do you want?

376
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,170
What do we want?!

377
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,360
Stop it!

378
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,350
You bunch of kids.

379
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,780
You should be studying at school.

380
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,020
What're you doing here?

381
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,910
What're you doing with these wimpy kids?

382
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,610
Who is a wimpy kid?

383
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,280
You.

384
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,540
You think I'm afraid of a middle-aged man?

385
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,160
Who is middle-aged?!

386
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,610
Listen to me.

387
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,040
Listen to me.

388
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,750
Middle-aged means people above thirty-five by law.

389
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm thirty-four.

390
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,130
Wu Sir, what're you doing here?

391
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,670
Shanqi told me.

392
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,020
So I come to check.

393
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,150
This kind of thing,

394
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,680
I think we should let our teacher know it.

395
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,910
Get lost!

396
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
O...Original Boss?

397
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,700
Who are you?

398
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,390
It's me, Doggy.

399
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,710
The Doggy, your follower back then.

400
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,910
Doggy?

401
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,210
I remember you now.

402
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,220
You're not a kid anymore.

403
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,480
Don't touch our boss.

404
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,950
Do you know who is this?

405
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,490
My boss.

406
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,870
The hooligan of hooligans.

407
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
The strongest among the strongest.

408
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,490
Wu Heng.

409
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,750
What's going on?

410
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,890
I feel so dizzy.

411
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,560
What's happening?

412
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,100
Who can explain this for us?

413
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,660
Students, here's the thing.

414
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,670
It's just I'm also once young.

415
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,160
I'm the founder of this gang.

416
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,730
But when I built this,

417
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,560
it was not like this.

418
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,560
I built this to benefit the society.

419
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,420
To help people in need.

420
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,970
Like helping old grandma to cross the road.

421
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,950
Carrying goods for old grandpa.

422
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,070
But them?

423
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,290
What're you guys doing here?

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,020
Ignore all the rules and duties.

425
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,790
Since that,

426
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,090
I think it's time to dismiss this society.

427
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,020
Boss.

428
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,310
Don't call me Boss, he is our boss.

429
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,100
You heard him.

430
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,440
Dismiss then.

431
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,160
Why're you still standing here?

432
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,970
Don't you hear that?

433
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,020
Go.

434
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,920
Go home for dinner. Leave.

435
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,520
Bye, boss.

436
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,430
Don't stay in here.

437
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,780
Go home and do your homework.

438
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,220
Do hand it in tomorrow.

439
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,350
Ke'er.

440
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,060
So you came here today, for what?

441
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,740
Ke'er, about the blackboard newspaper.

442
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,080
I have so many things to tell you.

443
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,050
Yuan Ke'er.

444
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,970
Actually, I went to get you back
is not because of the blackboard newspaper.

445
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,160
It's because you're one of Class Ten.

446
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,950
But if you don't want to participate the competition.

447
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,260
We can totally understand.

448
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,280
No, I want in.

449
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,860
I caused too much trouble earlier.

450
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,620
Let me do something for Class Ten this time.

451
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,150
Okay.

452
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
It's great!

453
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,910
Now I'll announce the results of the blackboard newspaper.

454
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,730
The third prize, Class Five, Grade One.

455
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,670
The Second prize, Class Two, Grade One.

456
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,990
The First prize,

457
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,180
Class One, Grade One.

458
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,340
Not in the top three?

459
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,360
What? What did you say?

460
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,060
Not in the top three?

461
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,290
Class ten, Grade One? Top three?

462
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,040
Hilarious!

463
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,310
You know what?

464
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,140
We only care about the top three.

465
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,640
The others are not in the list.

466
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,450
Otherwise, you must be hanging at the last!

467
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,090
What is that thing on your blackboard?

468
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,830
Comics?

469
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,220
Any knowledge? Any useful content?

470
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,830
You want a prize by that?

471
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,650
Hilarious!

472
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,690
Well, the winners.

473
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,530
Send a representative to get the prize in Guidance office.

474
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,260
Congrats! Congrats!

475
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,080
Okay, dismiss. Dismiss.

476
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,720
Class Ten, calm down.

477
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,050
Don't be upset.

478
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,640
You're Class Ten.

479
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,440
It's normal to be defeated by us.

480
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
We'll win.

481
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,050
What did you say?

482
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,310
Listen to me.

483
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,470
We, Class ten will defeat your class at least once in this semester.

484
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,670
Keep dreaming.

485
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,590
Enough.

486
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,740
Don't argue with those boring guys.

487
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,010
Let's go.

488
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,620
Who is boring? Explain it.

489
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,030
Liao Danyi.

490
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,350
One day you'll realize.

491
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,530
You're nothing like your classmates there.

492
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm so mad. So mad

493
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,760
Can't hear you.

494
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,930
I'll beat you to death.

495
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,770
Monitor.

496
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,180
Thank you for giving me the chance.

497
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,170
Sorry I let you down.

498
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,590
Why?

499
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,170
We should thank you for that.

500
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,040
You've done a lot.

501
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,270
It's so beautiful.

502
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,420
But we didn't win any prize.

503
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,170
No, you won.

504
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,660
You won the best painter prize in Class Ten.

505
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,780
Is there such a prize?

506
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm the monitor,

507
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,110
I have the right to create a prize like that.

508
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,910
Create?

509
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,250
And most beautiful painter prize.

510
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,690
Most creative work prize.

511
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,860
Any prize for me?

512
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,740
I always want some prize.

513
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,770
Yes. The most handsome idol prize.

514
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,430
I'm flattered.

515
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,660
You earned it.

516
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,740
The trophy?

517
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,230
I'm the monitor of Class Ten.

518
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,910
So today, I'll hand the prize to you.

519
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,680
Let's go to that shop.

520
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,830
I'll buy ice cream for everyone!

521
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,460
Psychological victory?

522
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,620
Commissary in charge of studies.

523
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,270
We can't use the class fee for this.

524
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,630
So we'll go dutch.

525
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,760
No way.

526
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,630
How about we throw Ke'er up in the air?

527
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,200
Are we really gonna do that?

528
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,280
We didn't win any prize.

529
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,800
No, no.

530
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,630
We just want to...throw her!

531
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,160
Let go! Let go!
