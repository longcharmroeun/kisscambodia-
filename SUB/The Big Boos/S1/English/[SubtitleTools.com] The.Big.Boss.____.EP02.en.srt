1
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,640
Monitor! Big boss! I was wrong.

2
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,370
Forgive me, big boss!

3
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,710
Forgive me, big boss!

4
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,280
Forgive me, okay?

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Forgive me.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,630
I was blind. I was a fool.

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,800
I was wrong, big boss!

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,040
Big boss, forgive me.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Monitor. Look.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,930
This is the traitor who
didn't believe you would be elected.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,160
- Liao Danyi.
- No, no.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,400
We must condemn him.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,060
- Make sure he will never rise up.
- No, no!

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,940
-Tell him to go to hell!
-I didn't, monitor!

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,450
Forgive me, big boss.

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,690
I'm not a man. I'm not a man.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,350
I'm not a man, I'm a beast.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,140
Monitor, forgive me, okay?

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,360
We shall cast him aside.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,980
We shall stone him to death!

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,380
- Stone him to death!
- Wait!

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,290
Yes. He is a sinner.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,000
But you people,

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,980
throw a stone if you think you're innocent.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,850
For example!

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,420
Me!

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,420
Stone him to death! Stone him!

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,930
Mo... Monitor.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,140
I was wrong!

# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,130
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
# Waiting, the signal for running #

40

The Big Boss

59
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,930
Episode 02

60
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,110
What're you doing?

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,600
Aren't you the normal student Liao Danyi?

62
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,160
Do you need any help from your monitor?

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,650
No, thanks.

64
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,170
Good.

65
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,410
If there's anything, just tell your monitor.

66
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,980
Normal student.

67
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,110
Then please give me some room.

68
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,800
I'd like to study.

69
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,080
Is there anything making you upset?

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,340
Any worries?

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,130
Or any setbacks?

72
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,500
Ye muxi.

73
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,000
Just enjoy your moment of joy.

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,780
Because soon you'll realize

75
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,350
monitor is not an easy job that anyone can handle.

76
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,180
Yeah, yeah. Grapes are sour when you can't eat it.

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,770
Fifteen days.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
What?

79
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,210
Fifteen days is your limit.

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,090
Then you'll run to me with tears

81
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,180
and beg me to take the burden.

82
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,440
Then everything will go back to normal.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,460
I'm the monitor.

84
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,010
And you're my most troublesome problem student.

85
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,510
Like in primary school and junior middle school.

86
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,010
Everything back on track.

87
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,520
Liao Danyi, listen to me.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,780
No matter it's fifteen days or a semester,

89
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,930
or a year,

90
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,360
I will be a better monitor than you.

91
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,800
I will despise you on this position.

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,650
As the big boss forever.

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,060
This is the roster.

94
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,700
Please remember each name quickly.

95
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,730
You shall arrange duty roster every day.

96
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,180
Later, go to the office on the 3rd floor

97
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,680
and get your textbooks for grade ten.

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Remember, not one more

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,810
Not one less.

100
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,210
The blackboard newspaper needs new themes every week.

101
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,570
You can discuss this with
the Commissary in charge of entertainment.

102
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,880
Can't be too fashionable

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
nor too rigid, understand?

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,500
You shall make statistics about
all the course representatives' collections.

105
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,190
Supervise and help those students who
constantly fail to hand over their homeworks

106
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,540
You shall make budget for our class expenses.

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
When it's done, collect it from every students.

108
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,100
Our school pet, Green

109
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,730
eats bread and leaves.

110
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,800
Remember to feed it every day.

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Mind its nutrition arrangement.

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,840
One more things,

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,490
there're two students of Class Ten
didn't come to register till now.

114
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,400
Go find out the reasons and report it back to me.

115
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,070
That's all I can recall now.

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,330
Questions?

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,470
That duty roster...

118
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,350
Right,

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,640
the most important thing.

120
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Here, take this.

121
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,120
This is....

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,580
The key of our classroom.

123
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,530
And I need it for...

124
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,840
Aren't you the cutest student
who pretends to be confused?

125
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,970
You shall be entitled to
open and close our door from today.

126
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,940
I can't.

127
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,530
Students who arrive earlier will be locked outside.

128
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,410
What're you talking about?

129
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,770
I found you do have a sense of humor.

130
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,390
As the monitor of Class 10.

131
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,720
How could you not be the one
who enters the classroom first and leaves at last?

132
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,650
My advise is

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,200
just half an hour earlier than the others.

134
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,040
Just half an hour earlier.

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,210
Thank you.

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,120
As our commissary in charge of entertainment

137
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,480
I have many ideas of our blackboard newspaper.

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,460
I like the surrealism and abstractionism style.

139
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,380
Like Van Gogh, Picasso

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,050
Mondrian,

141
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,590
Dali.

142
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,700
Monitor, any opinions about
our blackboard newspaper this time?

143
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,820
We can settle our theme first.

144
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,650
Like crawfish?

145
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Snail?

146
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,140
Starry sky?

147
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,810
Right, and sunflower!

148
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,720
Sunflower. Do you like sunflower?

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,280
You're our monitor.

150
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,770
I need your opinion, monitor!

151
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,700
Huang Nan, you..

152
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,850
You'll be the labor representative.

153
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,140
I'm Huang Yi, big boss.

154
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,620
Right, right, Huang....Huang Yi.

155
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,400
You help me arrange the duty roster.

156
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,230
I'm Huang Nan, big boss.

157
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,410
No.

158
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,270
Right, I know. I...

159
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,630
Well, Huang...

160
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,170
We're worked together for so long.

161
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,840
At least you can remember our names.

162
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,100
Don't mind, Huang Yi.

163
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,170
I'm Huang Yi, big boss.

164
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,060
I'm Huang Nan.

165
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,770
Huang Yi.

166
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,320
Huang Nan.

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Huang Yi.

168
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,560
Huang Nan.

169
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,150
Huang Yi.

170

Why is this happening?

Nothing is like what I have imagined.

183
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,570
Like the contrast photo of
"before makeup" and "after makeup"?

184
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,390
First paragraph.

185
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,420
Tell me, what's your idea?

186
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,850
When I was in human form.

187
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,980
I had served a master.

188
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,530
Oh, Liu...

189
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,950
Don't mention his name.

190
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,030
Because I don't like to be considered

191
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,940
as a man who would talk behind people's back.

192
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,560
That master was once a merchant

193
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,410
who sold some DIY fashion things.

194

Straw sandals.

195
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,940
Not that specific.

196
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,440
That master...

197
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,460
how shall I put it...

198
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,480
He has no advantages over anyone else,

199
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,380
except his long arms.

201

Don't mention his name.

202
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,970
I didn't like him at first.

203
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
So although he came to visit me for several times.

204
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,470
But I didn't see him.

205
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,590
However, he was so persistent.

206
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,470
Even I pulled him into
my blacklist and turned off my phone.

207
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,250
None of those had stopped him.

208
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,370
He always came with his men.

209
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,760
Said they were gonna burn my house.

210
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,840
Anyway, carrot and stick

211
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,370
In the end, I had to give up.

212
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,650
And became the CEO of his group.

213
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,850
Then time flied.

214
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,410
He grew more rebellious.

215
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,760
Even left me a hot potato before he died.

216
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,860
But on the whole,

217
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,210
It was quite a satisfying cooperation.

Wonder girl, easy. Easy! Easy!

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
What I mean is

223
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,770
a great leader doesn't need
to be so great in anything.

224
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,550
Like my former master.

225
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,530
You only need to remember one phrase.

226
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,380
What's that?

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,090

Piece of cake!

no more than five days' absence in a semester.

But they didn't show up for two days.

275

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,100
From the Maple Leaf Middle School?

342
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,070
I'm Xiaodong's broker, Annie.

343
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Nice to meet you, I'm Liao Danyi.

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,390
Okay. Good! Everybody, take a break!

345
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,200
Thank you, director!

346
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,620
Xiaodong, well done.

347
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,700
What are they doing?

348
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,350

00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,220
Ep?

351
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Don't you know him?

352
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,010
Gosh.

353
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,140
He is the most popular idol now.

354
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,730
An idol?

355
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,970
How was I?

356
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,200
Super great.

357
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,700
Not that dramatic.

358

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,210
You're...

360
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,890
Right, he said he is your classmate.

361
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,970
Nice to meet you.

362
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm Liao Danyi, from Maple Leaf Middle School

363
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,620
Commissary in charge of studies of Class Ten.

364
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,870
I came to ask you why you didn't go to register.

365
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,780
I'm so sorry about that.

366
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,590
I did go to register on time yesterday.

367
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,530
But something came up.

368
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,550
So I'm here today.

369
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,310
What came up?

370
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,380
Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong!

371
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,630
So many long nights

372
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,820
made their hair greasy

373
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,430
So many days in waiting,

374
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,280
made them look pale,

375
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,940
with bloodshot eyes.

376
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,160
So many hours screaming,

377
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,280
made them voice hoarse.

378
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,510
In order to get the front row to see Xue Xiaodong.

379
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,720
Their clothes are in strips.

380
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,920
They're not afraid of pains.

381
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,990
They can think of one name

382
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,130
which is

383
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,050
Xue Xiaodong.

384
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,450
Xue Xiaodong!

385
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,960
No matter how strong our guards are.

386
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,560
we can never stop them.

387
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,530
When they see Xiaodong.

388
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,170
When they....when they...

389
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,690
Be tough, sis Annie.

390
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,410
They will not let go of anything.

391
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,320
Xiaodong's hair, clothes,

393
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,280
When they see Xiaodong.

394
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,780
They will never stop

395
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,300
until they get every bit of you.

396
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,960
Is that so?

397
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,040
Is that so? Is that so?!

398
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
Look!

399
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,490
These scratches were they left on me at school gate.

400
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,820
Okay, okay, okay. I see.

401
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,760
Now they know Xiaodong will
go to Maple Leaf Middle School.

402
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,410
And they know there won't be
too many guards in the school.

403
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,270
So they're all around at the school gate.

404
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,760
That's why I didn't go to school yesterday.

405
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,000
Since it's so troublesome to be an idol.

406
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,930
Why don't you just quit?

407
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,690
You...

408
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,520
No way, Liao.

409
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,670

00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,100
I was too naive.

512
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,250
Be an idol or a student.

513
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,220
Maybe I should go abroad to be a trainee.

514
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,770
No.

515
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,630
Why?

516
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,600
Yesterday, it was your choice
to go to school or not.

517
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,370
But now,

518
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,880
you must go report in Class Ten.

519
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,940
Why is that?

520
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,790
Because there's a student.

521
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,650
I don't want to be defeated by that one.

522
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,520
Never mind, you don't need to know the details.

523
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,560
I have an idea.

524
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,120
What is that?

525
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,390
My god. What...what is this?

526
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,340
Xue Xiaodong.

527
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,800
Xue Xiaodong?

528
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Why that sounds so familiar?

529
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,580
So creepy.

530
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,650
So handsome.

531
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,840
He is in our class.

532
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,860
Should come to school today.

533
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,580
Wait, say it again?

534
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,020
Xue Xiaodong, wait for me.

535
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,770
I'm also your big fan!

536
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,260
Here I am to study as well!

537
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,630
I'm coming. I'm coming.

538
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,980
Wait for me. wait for me.

539
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,350
Xue Xiaodong. Xue Xiaodong.

540
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,570
We're gonna meet right away!

541
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,020
Hello, classmate Xiaodong. I'm your fan...

542
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,220
I'm your classmate, Zhu Shanqi.

543
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,050
Nice to meet you.

544
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,930
Nice to meet you.

545
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,380
Hello everyone, I'm Xue Xiaodong.

546
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,730
Nice to meet you.

547
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,450
Hello everyone, I'm Zhu Shanqi.

548
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,080
Hope I can be friend with Xiao....

549
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,270
Be friends with all of you.

550
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,290
So it's a tie?

551
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,540
Liao Danyi. What are you wearing?

552
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,220
Don't ask.

553
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,090
You don't want to mess with an idol.

554
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,480
Although it's a tie.

555
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,130
But it's my first day as the monitor.

556
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,320
Yet you're so experienced.

557
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,810
How is that? Liao Dayi.

558
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,740
I'm a better monitor than you.

559
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,020
Say it. Say it. Say it out.

560
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,690
Say, say, say it.

561
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,890
About that...

562
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,130
Who gave the key to those two bandits!

563
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,820
Haven't you done any research?

564
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,100
Huang Nan and Huang Yi are the two
most famous imps in junior middle school.

565
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,690
Is that enough?

566
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,500
A little more.

567
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,360
You gave them the chemistry lab?

568
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,000
Many things in school have been bombed into ashes now.

569
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,210
Too exaggerated.

570
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,260
And the blackboard newspaper.

571
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,330
What is that?

572
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,850
You told our artist,

573
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,610
the Commissary in charge of entertainment. Just do it.

574
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,800
By the way.

575
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,900
Because our whole class all went to get the textbooks.

576
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,570
The way to the Education Office is all blocked.

577
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,920
Ye Muxi.

578
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,860
You've a long way to go on the road.

579
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,970
Liao Danyi.

580
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,940
You're the one I hate the most in the world.

581
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,090
I feel the same with you. Monitor.
