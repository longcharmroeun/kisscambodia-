Episode 15

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,390
Stop.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,090
Monitor, last time...

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,040
Li Yao took away my pressed powder.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,620
My mom bought me that a few days ago.

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,380
I haven't used it yet.

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,640
That goes too far.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,380
A gentleman takes things by fair means.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,530
Yes.

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,880
This is the third compliant we've received this week.

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,820
All about that Li Yao.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,550
Li Yao, female, sixteen years old.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
A student in Class Ten, Grade One.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,910
Also a famous bully in our school.

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,470
So she's the so called bully.

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,650
But she's gonna meet someone tougher.

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,180
But this kind of person looks so scaring.

47
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,680
We better let our teacher handle her.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,410
No.

49
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,460
We can solve all the problems.

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,020
Why waste such an opportunity?

51
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,150
Yes.

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,490
Well, do you guys have any ideas?

53
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,690
Of course we should play tough against her directly!

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,090
Fight with her.

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,300
No. Violence can't solve any problem.

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,960
If we fight,

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,690
won't we be the same like her?

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,380
Well, monitor, do you have any ideas?

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,880
A duel face-to-face.

60
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,350
I've told you, violence can't solve any problem.

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,020
Besides, that's your textbook.

62
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,640
Don't scrawl on it.

63
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,780
Now the most important thing is,

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,770
to talk with her about what's really going on.

65
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,230
That's a very unique idea.

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,230
First of all,

67
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,030
we should send a mild yet mediocre student to her.

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,010
Why are you guys looking at me?

69
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,590
This is Li Yao?

70
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,570
She's indeed tall and burly.

71
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,500
Looks so scaring.

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,300
Where is she going?

73
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,390
God knows.

74
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,750
To do something scaring probably.

75
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,050
Zhu Shanqi, go.

76
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,190
Action speaks louder than heartbeats.

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,640
It's time for an afternoon tea.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,500
Bye.

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,590
Zhu Shanqi, don't try to shrink back from this battle.

80
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,140
I'll go. Is she that scaring?

81
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,940
Hey!

82
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,520
What's up?

83
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,700
Do you like spicy strips?

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,920
Yes.

85
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,920
Have some, then.

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,170
What are you gonna eat if I eat it?

87
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,580
Wait.

88
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,120
I'll buy you more.

89
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,580
Girl, choose whatever you like.

90
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,470
Here. Come on, spicy strips...

91
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,510
How much?

92
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,450
Five Yuan each one.

93
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,580
All my allowance this month.

94
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,020
Here it is.

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,990
I want four.

96
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,590
Thank you, sir.

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,380
Okay.

98
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,430
Here, spicy strips. Spicy strips.

99
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,400
Here, spicy strips.

100
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,800
Why did you buy so many?

101
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,040
Why are you so fierce?

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,140
As expected, you were bullied.

103
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,640
Yes.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,950
I've used up my allowance this month.

105
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,030
Still helps nothing.

106
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,540
She's gone too far!

107
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,210
How could she bully my friend like that?

108
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,810
Can't stand it any more.

109
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,500
What are you drawing?

110
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,730
It means nothing to defeat her in the cartoon world.

111
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,020
It seems that I should stand out now.

112
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,780
Don't worry. For this day,

113
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,500
we've been preparing for a long time.

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,350
I have at least ten ways to defeat her.

115
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,320
Between classes, we're invincible.

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,830
And I have ten thousand ways to make her die.

117
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,330
You're Li Yao, aren't you?

118
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,810
You can talk to me.

119
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,400
Don't point your finger at me.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
My dad told me,

121
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,510
it's very impolite for boys to talk with girls like that!

122
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,480
Understand?

123
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,070
Yes. Yes.

124
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,530
Shoot. What's the matter?

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,390
It's said that you're beautiful.

126
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,180
So we came to check it out.

127
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
As we see,

128
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,520
it's worth coming here!

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,790
Beautiful!

130
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,490
Can't be more beautiful!

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,020
So great!

132
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,620
Lucky that she runs away.

133
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,880
-Or I'll beat her to death!
-All right, that's all.

134
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,880
Enough. Enough. Enough.

135
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,180
Guys.

136
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,820
Just now, I've talked with everyone

137
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
who claimed to have been bullied by Li Yao.

138
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,070
I think, we've worked
in a wrong direction since the very start.

139
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,310
It's not right?

140
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,510
We've been following her...

141
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,820
What solution does he have?

142
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,820
We can't even handle this.

143
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,760
How could Liao Danyi make it?

144
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,490
What's the matter?

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,690
Li Yao.

146
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm Liao Danyi, commissary
in charge of studies of Class Ten.

147
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,260
I want to make friends with you.

148
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,660
Damn it. Damn it.

149
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,800
Liao Danyi, run!

150
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,330
Can't watch this.

151
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,460
Friends?

152
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,410
Yes.

153
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,070
Although he's my enemy,

154
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,730
I gotta help him out.

155
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,920
Come back.

156
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,250
You're sure you want to make friends with me?

157
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Any problem?

158
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,060
No problem.

159
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,690
What's going on?

160
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
So Li Yao actually is a good student. Right?

161
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,570
Indeed she is.

162
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,380
I've seen her feed homeless cats between classes.

163
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,490
So I made such a guess.

164
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,590
You're mad at me because of spicy strips.

165
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,270
Only because you thought it's too wasteful?

166
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,280
Yes!

167
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, my god. Still feel a little scared.

168
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,030
It seems that Li Yao is from a military family.

169
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,410
Her mom is more amazing.

170
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,620
A national arm & fist boxing champion.

171
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,360
Arm & fist boxing?

172
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,260
A boxing technique to hit yourself first
before you hit the others.

173
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,070
I've been practicing it since childhood.

174
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,730
And I grow up in a martial arts school.

175
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,120
But dad thinks that I'm not like a girl at all.

176
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,540
He's afraid that no one will marry me.

177
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,680
So he sends me into Maple Leaf Middle School for a change.

178
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,160
So we're the same kind of people!

179
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,410
Let's be friends...

180
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,340
It seems that growth environment

181
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,140
makes you lack interpersonal communication.

182
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,140
Actually it also troubles me.

183
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,700
I also want to make friends.

184
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,920
But since the beginning of this semester,

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,620
no one talks to me, let alone makes friends with me.

186
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,230
But I've made some progress anyway.

187
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,710
When some students looked in my eyes,

188
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,110
they gave me snacks.

189
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,460
Isn't that called tributes?

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,720
Some other students are also very nice.

191
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,800
Although I broke their stuff,

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,360
they didn't blame me.

193
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,370
Isn't it because they dare not hold you responsible?

194
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,050
Actually I'm the same as you guys.

195
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,360
I also want a wonderful high school life.

196
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,210
And friends as good as you guys.

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
But...

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,650
No one wants to make friends with me.

199
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,100
That's no big deal.

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,480
Now you have us around you.

201
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,230
We'll help you become more like a girl.

202
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,920
A very adorable and very cute girl.

203
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,350
A girl everyone will fall for once they see you.

204
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,350
From now on,

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,510
a sparrow will turn into a phoenix.

206
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,740
Okay!

207
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,470
Weren't we gonna punish a monster?

208
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,010
What do you girls like normally?

209
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,880
Look, that toy.

210
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,120
How about you taking a picture with him?

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
No.

212
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,460
Come on.

213
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,640
Look, he's so round and he's dancing.

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,820
So cute!

215
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,100
You should be exposed to such things more.

216
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,700
How about you guys going there with me?

217
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,160
No, you should try such things by yourself.

218
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Hurry. Hurry.

219
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,790
We'll support you right here.

220
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,800
Good luck.

221
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,100
Why are you running away?

222
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,670
Thief! Thief!

223
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,450
Stop! Thief!

224
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,650
Stop!

225
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,800
Stop right there!

226
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,680
-Why are you running away?
-Thief!

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,430
-Stop!
-Thief! Get him!

228
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,130
Don't let him run away! Stop!

229
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,010
Thief! Get him!

230
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,580
Thief! Stop!

231
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,980
Stop! He's there!

232
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,910
Get the thief!

233
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,070
Stop!

234
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,760
Thief! Thief!

235
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,640
Stop! Stop!

236
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,960
Stop! Stop!

237
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,210
Thief! Thief!

238
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,380
Stop!

239
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,190
Sis, I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

240
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,630
I didn't kill anyone!

241
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,800
Sis, I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

242
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,050
Spare me, sis.

243
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm wrong. It's yours now.

244
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,330
It's yours, okay?

245
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

246
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,290
What's going on?

247
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,260
Thank you, sis.

248
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
For helping me get back my purse.

249
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,720
I'll send a silk banner to your school.

250
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,850
Never mind.

251
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,930
It's what we should do.

252
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm Ye Muxi.

253
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,390
Ye Muxi.

254
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Ye Muxi. Thank you. Thank you.

255
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Well, what should we do next?

256
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,240
You caught a thief.

257
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,420
Class Ten has done another good deed.

258
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,120
But, Li Yao,

259
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,580
when you're chasing that thief,

260
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,980
you were so cool!

261
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,340
Not that exaggerated.

262
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,330
Li Yao, you're really good at Kungfu?

263
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,410
You bet.

264
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,750
My mom taught me.

265
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,580
But she won't let me use it normally.

266
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,110
Or I'll hurt other people.

267
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,000
Makes sense.

268
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,910
A toy store.

269
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,790
Li Yao.

270
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,880
Next, your task is to buy two fluffy toys.

271
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,610
Little girl.

272
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,380
Little girl.

273
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,700
How could you steal at such a young age?

274
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,400
Unbelievable. Where are your parents?

275
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,080
Only you alone here?

276
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,320
Xiaoshan.

277
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,540
Didn't I tell you that?

278
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,680
Don't run about.

279
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,980
After you choose a bear,

280
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,390
wait for me to pay for you.

281
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,820
Okay. Thirty Yuan it is.

282
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,620
Let's go.

283
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,390
Look. Look.

284
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,210
Easy. Easy.

285
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,280
Today you're not the leading actress, okay?

286
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,830
Okay.

287
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,540
Well, how can we help Li Yao be relaxed

288
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,720
and enjoy this to her heart's content?

289
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,820
Boss.

290
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,420
Actually we have an idea.

291
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,360
To help Li Yao be relaxed and pleasant,

292
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,520
we better give her a male partner.

293
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,080
You guys?

294
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,910
We'll pass.

295
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,760
I think this male partner must look totally harmless.

296
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,590
-Xue Xiaodong?
-No!

297
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,740
I'll pass.

298
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,170
No, you can't.

299
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,580
Actually we have a more suitable candidate.

300
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
And I've called him just now.

301
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,740
Monitor.

302
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,560
I...

303
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,360
Huang Yi called just now. Told me to come here.

304
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,990
So... So soon?

305
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,070
I've called just now!

306
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,290
Is there a distance between our school and here?

307
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,950
It seems only three miles.

308
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,950
Just needs a little running.

309
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,260
Li Yao, come here.

310
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,100
Let me introduce someone to you.

311
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,200
This is our classmate, Cheng Ling.

312
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,410
Leigong made a huge mistake.

313
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,020
When his opponent attacked,

314
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,310
he shouldn't back off.

315
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,570
He should stand firmly there.

316
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,460
So, there's no distinctive difference between

317
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,580
kickboxing and our traditional martial arts.

318
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,400
Understand?

319
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,840
Ye... Yes.

320
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,940
Hurry. Hurry. Follow them closely.

321
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,330
Li Yao.

322
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,880
Do you like this?

323
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,890
What do you think are they talking about?

324
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,170
Have they started talking?

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,340
We're pretty far away from them.

326
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,860
When could this run faster?

327
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,510
Can't get them now.

328
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,410
Hurry.

329
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,040
We're already in the amusement park.

330
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,410
How could we not try the most classic one?

331
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,480
That means...

332
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,150
Sky wheel!

333
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,840
Li Yao.

334
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,430
Have you tried the sky wheel?

335
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,890
No.

336
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,170
A boy and a girl in a room.

337
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,520
Sounds so exciting!

338
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,710
But...

339
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,830
How should we do the match?

340
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,870
Why it's you, brother?

341
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,870
This is different from my script!

342
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,530
I want a girl!

343
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,090
Why no girls for us?

344
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,790
Didn't we agree to draw lots?

345
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,270
This world is so dark.

346
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,140
Li Yao, it's your first time to be here.

347
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,600
How do you feel?

348
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,740
I think the view is so good.

349
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,850
Do you think so?

350
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,610
Li Yao, what's wrong with you?

351
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,140
I don't know.

352
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,530
It's my first time.

353
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,150
Are you... Are you acrophobia?

354
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Does that mean I will feel dizzy,

355
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,900
and my heart beats fast?

356
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,580
Yes.

357
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,860
Well, I'm acrophobia.

358
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,940
Maybe because it's your first time here.

359
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,190
It's okay. It's okay.

360
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,050
Follow me. Calm down and breathe.

361
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,050
Make it stop. Make it stop!

362
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,290
Make it stop!

363
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,700
Anyone hear me?

364
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,340
-It's okay.
-Let me out!

365
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,910
-Li Yao, calm down.
-Let me out!

366
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,760
Easy. I'm here.

367
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Make it stop!

368
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,660
-Sit. Calm down.
-Stop this!

369
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,430
It's okay.

370
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,370
Let go!

371
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,280
My Kungfu won't help.

372
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,950
It's too high here!

373
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,900
I better let you hold my hands.

374
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,250
It's okay, Li Yao.

375
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,250
Breathe slowly.

376
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,920
What a beautiful view!

377
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,150
Such a rare opportunity. Still watching your phone?

378
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,790
Reference materials.

379
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,620
It's a rare opportunity to see such a beautiful view!

380
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,950
But you keep studying and studying.

381
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,740
You know nothing but studying!

382
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,820
Do you remember my brother took us out
to the amusement park when we were kids?

383
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,800
You enjoyed it much more than I did.

384
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,990
Since when did you become like this?

385
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,840
Because we've grown up.

386
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,950
If a grown-up have to be like this,

387
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,950
I wish I could be a kid forever.

388
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,240
Look, how beautiful the sunset is!

389
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,720
Do you know that?

390
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,250
Make a wish when the wheel reaches the peak.

391
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,700
It'll come true.

392
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,160
Really?

393
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,510
I should make a wish sincerely, then.

394
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,620
Let's do this together?

395
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,780
Okay.

396
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,180
But those clouds are really beautiful.

397
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,890
And such a beautiful sky wheel.

398
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,400
But I have to enjoy this with you...

399
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,310
No one made you stay in the same place with me.

400
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,260
But we always ended up together.

401
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,420
No matter when we were kids, or right now.

402
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,010
So despairing.

403
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,200
In fact, Li Yao, you know what?

404
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,050
You don't look fierce at all.

405
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,460
I think,

406
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,900
you're just a very cute girl.

407
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,150
What are you talking about?!

408
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,190
Better hold hands.

409
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,440
Isn't it pretty fun?

410
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,630
Ye Muxi, thank you for giving me

411
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,080
a most wonderful day in my life.

412
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,600
What's wrong with you guys?

413
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,710
Don't ask us. Don't want to answer that.

414
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,250
How are Cheng Ling and Li Yao doing now?

415
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
Come here. Come here.

416
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,380
How do you feel?

417
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,890
Not bad.

418
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,810
We make it anyway!

419
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,970
What?

420
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,780
That... That indescribable...

421
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,160
Flushing and heart beating.

422
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,250
Look. Look.

423
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,430
That's it.

424
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,600
All right.

425
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,620
Thank you.

426
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,390
You have fully proved yourself.

427
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,360
Come on, let's try another one! Let's go!

428
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,740
It's already dark. Ye Muxi!

429
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,550
Don't wanna play any more.

430
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,360
Li Yao, why are you still standing there?

431
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,570
Right. Come here.

432
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,060
Hurry, join us.

433
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,450
Let's go.

434
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,860
It's really fun.

435
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,460
Okay.

436
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,940
No.

437
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,140
-Okay.
-Not okay.

438
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,780
Li Yao, what brought you here?

439
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,590
Monitor.

440
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,590
I want to a member of our class committee.

441
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,400
Why did you suddenly have such a thought?

442
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,570
Here is the thing.

443
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,440
Since we came back from the amusement park,

444
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,300
I took your advice and always smiled at every student.

445
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,430
As a result...

446
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,320
Desirable results?

447
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,560
Some could understand that I wasn't bullying them.

448
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,360
But some...

449
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,590
Right.

450
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,810
If someone pops out and keeps smiling at you,

451
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,230
it's really creepy.

452
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,650
Never mind.

453
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,270
As long as some of them can understand me,

454
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,720
I feel very happy.

455
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,120
Besides, Liao Danyi has explained
to everyone who had misunderstanding about me.

456
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Everyone starts to review me.

457
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,700
Liao Danyi?

458
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,780
Thank you very much.

459
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,720
And I admire you guys very much.

460
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,000
You can be together every day and you're happy.

461
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,120
So I want to further change myself.

462
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,910
If you don't look down upon me,

463
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm willing to contribute all my bravery

464
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,580
and martial arts to you.

465
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,390
Why do I feel...

466
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,390
We've got a tough warrior?

467
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,100
May I?

468
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,030
Of course.

469
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,070
But you want to be...

470
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,390
I want a gentle position.

471
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
Commissary in charge of labor?

472
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,050
Okay, no problem.

473
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,090
Your ability goes beyond that.

474
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,460
But, before that...

475
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,750
You must teach me your arm & fist boxing.

476
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,870
Rise, please!

477
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,530
Monitor, don't worry.

478
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,190
I'll spare no effort.

479
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
Let me start it now.

480
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,280
Go to the playground first.

481
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,490
Here is our classroom.

482
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,060
A place for study.

483
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,670
My god.

484
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,670
You're so scaring.

485
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,900
Scaring?

486
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,900
Why?

487
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,590
I'm already not myself.

488
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,220
For you,

489
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,420
I've totally abandoned the old me.

490
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,510
Everything that I'm doing now,

491
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,500
is for you.

492
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,650
When your love for me blows hot and cold,

493
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,280
I'll lose my bearings.

494
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm so useless.

495
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,770
I know you give up a lot for me.

496
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,630
I know you sacrifice your self-esteem

497
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,630
and pride to indulge me.

498
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,280
What a valuable thing it is!

499
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,310
This time, listen to me.

500
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,500
Next time, I'll listen to you.

501
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,770
If two people want to sustain their love,

502
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,280
they need to understand each other.

503
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,720
In this world,

504
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,000
how could someone like you ever exist?

505
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,700
In this world,

506
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,510
there's someone like me

507
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,490
for someone like you in this world.

508
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,410
I'm not good at house chores.

509
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,360
I don't need a housekeeper.

510
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,250
I'm not good at cooking.

511
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,280
I don't need a chef.

512
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,610
I'm not good at social life.

513
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,480
I don't need a diplomatist.

514
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,540
What on earth do you want?

515
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,520
You.

516
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,700
I only want you.

517
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,660
I cry a lot.

518
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,660
You can lay in my arms.

519
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,660
Cry to your heart's content.

520
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,790
I'm very bad tempered and capricious.

521
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,700
I love your bad temper and your capriciousness.

522
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,280
No. No.

523
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,100
No!

524
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,340
Xinyi...

525
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,380
Did you get hurt?

526
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,630
What did you say just now?

527
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,120
Say it again?

528
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,290
I said, I'll give in to you in every way.

529
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,010
And dote on you.

530
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,810
Why do you have to push me?

531
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,600
Do I have to be a parrot with no self,

532
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,330
no ideas and thoughts of my own?

533
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,330
I won't make you a parrot!

534
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,390
I think there's something resonant between us.

535
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,390
Love might make me blind.

536
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,390
But it can't make me follow you blindly.

537
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,900
Do as I say is to follow me blindly?

538
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,760
Didn't expect you would judge our love like that!

539
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,100
You can't even fulfill the basic mutual understanding!

540
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,620
Let alone love!

541
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,620
Every time, it's me following your idea.

542
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,620
When have you followed mine?!

543
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,780
I got it.

544
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,030
I really want to be with you

545
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,030
through life and death together.

546
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,260
Whatever we do, we're on the same side.

547
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,440
But now, I think it's impossible.

548
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,540
Danyi!

549
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,980
How about this.

550
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,410
I'll buy you a new one.

551
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,460
Never mind. It's okay.

552
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,450
No. No.

553
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,060
I must buy you a new one as compensation.

554
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,840
I... I broke your mug. So I must compensate.

555
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,430
I... I probably have annoyed Li Yao.

556
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,630
This morning, she stopped next to my desk.

557
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,630
Raised my glass high in the air.

558
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,540
Next second, she broke it into pieces.

559
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,680
Now, I'm reflecting on myself seriously.

560
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,970
Hope I could find the reason why I annoyed her.

561
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,670
I didn't break it on purpose!

562
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,060
Who said I broke it on purpose?!

563
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,930
You?

564
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,430
Or you?
