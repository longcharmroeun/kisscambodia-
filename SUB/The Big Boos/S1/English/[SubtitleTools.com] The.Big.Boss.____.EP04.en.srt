Episode 04

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,540
This class we do a one thousand meters in class practice.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,560
The result won't be recorded.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,050
But I want all of you to take it seriously as well.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,810
Ready!

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,340
Why couldn't I defeat Sun Bin with Arthur yesterday?

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,420
You're a newbie.

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,740
Brothers will cover you.

38
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,540
Really?

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,590
Listen, I'll teach you some basic rules.

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,260
Arthur is a strong half flesh fighter.

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,700
How can you use the Hat skill?

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,400
You need to use the Time Wand!

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,410
Like Guan Yu, he needs to wear six pair of shoes.

44
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,880
Otherwise, he won't be fast enough!

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,830
Wait, wait, slow down.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll write it down.

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,450
You're eating snacks?

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,020
Thanks.

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,670
Shanqi, are you feeling better?

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,580
Teacher, I'm still a little dizzy.

51
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,740
Rest well.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,210
Thank you, teacher.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,360
Follow me, adjust your breath.

54
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,400
This is my strong point.

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,330
Just wait to eat the dirt behind me.

56
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,480
Come on, ready.

57
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,910
One. Two.

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,860
Xiaodong. Practicing?

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,930
No, Shanqi.

60
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,000
Xue Xiaodong!

61
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,050
I can't run any longer.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,350
I'm that close to win you.

63
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,820
I'm a circle ahead of you.

64
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,020
I'm not myself today. Next time.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,190
Do you hear me?

66
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,600
The heavenly god overpowers the tiger on the ground

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,090
The holy tower suffocates the ghost of the river.

68
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,480
Are you working alone before?

69
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,380
Why are you blushing?

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,140
My spirits soared.

71
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,120
Why turned yellow?

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,570
Why turned green?

73
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm hungry!

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,760
Let's eat!

75
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,250
Wonder girl Yezi,

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,660
it's not your first time to eat this delicious hotpot.

77
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,920
Where's your table manners?

78
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,190
I don't know why.

79
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,420
Recently, I always feel so hungry.

80
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,610
Can't hear you.

81
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,050
Can't have enough.

82
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,270
No problem.

83
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,240
I finished my work early this afternoon.

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,150
I found this hotpot restaurant especially for you.

85
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,730
I hope you can be like this everyday.

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,240
Owner, five more dishes of meat.

87
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,690
Look. It's delicious.

88
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,830
I love spicy strip. Try one.

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,260
Give me one.

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,330
Not you.

91
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,050
Monitor.

92
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,330
Yes, anything?

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,210
Shoot or leave me alone.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,520
You guys are unbelievable.

95
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,750
Firstly.

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,840
Efficiency values in everything.

97
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,060
We're here for the class committee meeting.

98
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,220
Not for a picnic.

99
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,110
Secondly?

100
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,630
Xue Xiaodong. What're you doing?

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,260
If you want to have a live concert.

102
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,090
Leave school.

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,530
Here's our classroom.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,910
A live concert?

105
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,850
Flowers have told me...

106
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,720
Shut up.

107
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,030
Sit down.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,430
We're at school.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,300
Where we learn things.

110
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,820
Please show some respect.

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,740
Sorry.

112
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,560
Give me one more.

113
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,940
And Huang Nan, Huang yi.

114
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,170
You two, don't mess around.

115
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,060
Never seen you so positive when we hand over the homework.

116
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,080
-Delicious?
-And you two.

117
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,030
What're you two gossiping about?

118
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,090
We're eating.

119
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,450
Eating?

120
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,470
Those junk food you eat

121
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,520
decide your chatting must be boring.

122
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,010
Spicy strip is not junk food!

123
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,660
Shut up!

124
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,130
Cheng Ling. What're you doing?

125
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,100
Daydreaming.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,370
You go on.

127
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,050
Sweet dreams. No one would miss it.

128
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,150
Finally we welcome....

129
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,310
Enough!

130
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm gonna go home to review my lessons.

131
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,060
Bye.

132
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,210
Bye.

133
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,630
Bye.

134
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,660
What's wrong?

135
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,370
Our class committee is so casual, which means

136
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,440
I have done a good job as a monitor.

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,170
We have no problems.

138
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,840
Everything is just great.

139
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,670
Right!

140
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,070
Shut up!

141
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,790
Great?

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,530
You have no organization and discipline.

143
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,820
As a monitor,

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,550
You're still unbuttoned.

145
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,370
I like it that way.

146
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,680
Freestyle, you know?

147
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,070
I think you just got fat.

148
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,970
Are you kidding me?

149
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,100
Who? Who got fat?

150
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,180
I'll show you.

151
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,160
Are you feeling alright? Too tight?

152
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,870
Uncomfortable, right?

153
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,600
I...

154
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,440
Still can't button it.

155
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,510
See?

156
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,800
I can not only button it.

157
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,630
Also with chest out. Danyi.

158
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,120
Who did that?

159
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,980
It's her.

160
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,960
It's her big chest!

161
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,460
Lad Danyi, you're finally here.

162
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,510
Come, come. Sit, sit down.

163
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,670
Make yourself at home.

164
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,440
Danyi.

165
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
The reason I invite you to dinner

166
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,130
Cause I need to ask you a favor.

167
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,060
Shoot.

168
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,850
To be honest.

169
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,170
My sweet Yezi,

170
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,820
She is a sweet girl.

171
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,290
But she can be so careless sometime.

172
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,470
So please take good care of her at school.

173
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,270
Thank you a lot.

174
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,800
She is young. Still a kid.

175
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,130
Today.

176
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,610
I will use this tea to toast to you.

177
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,090
Take good care of Yezi.

178
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,340
- Thank you, thank you.
- Okay.

179
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,830
You...I...I...

180
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,650
Him? Take care of me?

181
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,000
He is always tag along.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,780
So annoying.

183
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Tag along?

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,150
I'm way ahead of you when I run.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,130
And you've gain some weight recently.

186
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,780
You can tag along.

187
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,290
You....you...you...

188
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,100
You have only won me once.

189
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't take it for granted.

190
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,260
I didn't run so hard that time.

191
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,890
And recently, you...

192
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,560
Me what? What?

193
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,320
Got fat.

194
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,470
Yezi, Yezi, Yezi. Have some meat.

195
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,160
Yezi is great! Have some meat.

196
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,670
Who got fat?

197
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,670
Say it again!

198
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,300
You got fat! Why can't you admit it?

199
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,360
Can't you face the reality?

200
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,830
I'm a lady. Fat?

201
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,330
- Are you afraid? Say it again!
- You got fat. You got fat. You got fat!

202
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,390
I really got fat.

203
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,330
I must lose some weight.

204
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,470
Three hundred sit-ups.

205
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,070
I can't...

206
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,720
Any good idea?

207
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,900
That's awesome.

208
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,940
Say it gently. Gently!

209
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,480
Well, I don't know if I should say it or not.

210
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,730
Shoot.

211
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,350
You're not a normal girl.

212
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,260
I know.

213
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,890
But I like it. Continue.

214
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,090
Menci said,

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,840
When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on someone.

216
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,630
He will frustrate the one,

217
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,690
give him hard work.

218
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,820
make him starve.

219
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,070
but die in peace.

220
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,690
Makes perfect sense.

221
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,460
I ate it up!

222
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,780
Calm down.

223
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,320
We have more snacks in storage.

224
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,890
Spare me! Spare me!

225
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,770
First, be sharp and wise.

226
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,880
Just now, I found a secret master plan.

227
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,470
Here it is.

228
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,230
Look!

229
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,920
That man in the book is so strong!

230
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,140
This exercise is amazing!

231
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,460
It's true.

232
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,260
Here, here.

233
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,990
Looks great.

234
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,780
Look, it's invincible!

235
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,670
Look.

236
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,960
I ate it up again.

237
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,280
Wonder girl, relax.

238
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,230
We have more here.

239
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,240
Method of losing weight.

240
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,630
Can't find any.

241
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,460
Forget it.

242
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Anyone I know?

243
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,280
Fat guy, who needs to lose some weight.

244
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,670
Who was once very fat.

245
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,750
Xiaodong.

246
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,820
Can you do me a favor?

247
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,220
What is that?

248
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,530
Can you help me to lose some weight?

249
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,900
I see.

250
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,100
Piece of cake. Piece of cake.

251
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,890
But monitor, didn't you say

252
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,040
you are gonna buy me some soda water?

253
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,980
Why are you still eating chips yourself?

254
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,130
Here's the thing.

255
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,510
We started to practice today.

256
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,730
We just ran a big circle.

257
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,790
Then I started to feel hungry.

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,670
I just wanted to replenish energy before we start.

259
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,290
We have run so far. So starving.

260
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,290
But I can only afford this.

261
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Don't worry, I will treat you a big feast for helping me.

262
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,500
It's okay. I'm fine.

263
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,840
Chips have too much calorie.

264
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,870
I barely eat it.

265
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,350
A big feast is not necessary.

266
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,100
As an idol I must keep my figure looking good.

267
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,560
Don't worry. Monitor.

268
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,270
Your concern is my concern.

269
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,050
Since you kept my secret.

270
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,210
I will return this favor to you.

271
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,240
It's nothing.

272
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,020
Let's begin.

273
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,100
Then, will you do as what I say?

274
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,920
Repeat after me.

275
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,410
Lose weight or lose life!

276
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,390
Lose weight or lose life!

277
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,190
Louder!

278
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,650
Lose weight or lose life!

279
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,780
Good. How does that feel?

280
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,780
Good. Inspired.

281
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,080
Now throw your chips.

282
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,090
But... But I haven't eaten it up.

283
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,090
I'll throw it later.

284
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,920
Do you know how much calorie that has?

285
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,600
About 11.2 g Carbohydrate

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,520
About 24.1g Protein

287
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,130
About 30.8g Fat

288
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,300
So those add up

289
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,600
508cal.

290
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,560
A normal girl's daily calorie intake is 1014cal.

291
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,260
You have already got a half.

292
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,820
Are you sure you want to continue?

293
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,940
No.

294
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,270
Are you gonna eat this anymore?

295
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,000
No.

296
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm your calorimeter.

297
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,690
So if you want to lose some weight.

298
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,400
You must listen to me.

299
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,460
Say goodbye to junk food.

300
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,440
Junk food.

301
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,650
Goodbye.

302
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,910
Ye Muxi. What're you doing here?

303
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,970
Want some spicy strip?

304
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,840
Yes.

305
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,340
Are you ready? Ye Muxi?

306
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
I'm ready.

307
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,550
Okay.

308
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,740
First group.

309
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,290
Watch me.

310
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,800
One.

311
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,630
Two.

312
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,090
Three.

313
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,280
So easy!

314
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,400
You go.

315
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,400
Twenty.

316
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,420
Twenty?

317
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,150
A hundred!

318
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,040
Come on! Burn fat!

319
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,830
One!

320
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,130
Two!

321
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,690
Three!

322
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,580
Four!

323
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,620
Five.

324
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,540
Go down.

325
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,030
Five.

326
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,300
Ninety-five to go. Six.

327
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
Six.

328
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,340
Let's call it a day.

329
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,040
It has burnt.

330
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,930
Twenty at a time will only get it started.

331
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,150
No stop.

332
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,500
Seven!

333
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,680
Seven...

334
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,550
Stand up. Again.

335
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,300
Seven will do you no good.

336
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,560
Has to be twenty.

337
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,300
Think about the chips you had eaten.

338
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,580
Eight...

339
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,810
You haven't used up those calorie yet.

340
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,460
Eight...

341
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:35,990
Go down.

342
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,620
I can't.

343
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,090
No, no I can't.

344
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,510
Your bottom will get fatter if you sit down.

345
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,660
Wanna lose weight or not?

346
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,210
Stand up.

347
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,510
Xiaodong.

348
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,080
Boss Xiaodong.

349
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Can we start it easy?

350
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,770
Then...

351
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,010
This... This is too much for me.

352
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,620
That was just a warm-up.

353
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,190
We're about to begin now.

354
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,690
I'll teach you three moves.

355
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,700
Three times for each.

356
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,090
Stand up.

357
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,770
Finish your warm-up.

358
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,120
Up.

359
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,500
Nine.

360
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,920
Aren't you a nice sweet guy? Why...

361
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,540
The second you mention "weight"

362
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,080
Nice Xiaodong will become bad Xiaodong.

363
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,730
There's no nice way in this.

364
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,020
Nine.

365
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,440
Up!

366
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:30,980
Down!

367
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,190
Go on.

368
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
Come on.

369
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,830
I can't!

370
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,700
Come on. Go!

371
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,690
I can't!

372
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,730
No!

373
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,470
Okay. Good.

374
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,250
Come on. Come on.

375
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,660
Imagine, I'm your fat.

376
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,680
Your body fat.

377
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
- No.
- Come on. You can do it.

378
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm yours.

379
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,970
Stop.

380
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,220
Thanks.

381
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,250
I'll run by your side. Follow me.

382
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,510
Let's go.

383
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,450
Come on.

384
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,030
1.5 km to the endline.

385
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,090
That's easy to say. You drag this.

386
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,470
Okay. Move.

387
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,800
Watch me. let's go.

388
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,590
It's easy.

389
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,230
Ye Muxi.

390
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,930
You have to build some muscle while you lose your weight.

391
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,300
If you want to lose some weight.

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,870
Then you must gain your muscle.

393
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,410
You can't run from strength training.

394
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,450
You ring me up at 5 a.m.

395
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,280
to tell me this?

396
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,950
Look. We only have 1.5km left.

397
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,340
Hang in there!

398
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,770
Ye Muxi.

399
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,910
Make me a milk tea.

400
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,840
Sit down.

401
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,260
Why are you doing this to yourself?

402
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,390
It's because of Xiaodong's training.

403
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,320
He is a real monster.

404
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,840
I don't think so.

405
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,800
He is like an angel to me.

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,950
No.

407
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,680
Once you mention "weight" to him,

408
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,860
he will be completely changed!

409
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,070
So freaking!

410
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,640
Stop torturing yourself, why lose weight?

411
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,130
No.

412
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,740
I made an oath. I did.

413
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,170
It's so humiliating. No.

414
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,110
But when my Xiaodong gets serious.

415
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,080
That look on his face is so charming.

416
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,380
I'm thinking if I shall join your weight loss training?

417
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,350
But I never get fat!

418
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,750
Forget it.

419
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm gonna make a milk tea.

420
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,100
What's wrong?

421
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,580
My hands and feet hurt. Can't move.

422
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,360
Let's go have dinner.

423
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,950
What dinner?

424
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,590
Water?

425
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,630
Oatmeal?

426
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,990
Cookie?

427
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,190
Close your eyes.

428
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,870
Close your eyes.

429
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,000
Close your eyes and come.

430
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,610
Where are we going?

431
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,930
Just keep going.

432
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,600
No peep.

433
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,480
No peep.

434
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,890
Okay. Three. Two. One!

435
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,580
I prepared you this wholesome hotpot.

436
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,340
For me?

437
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,210
It's the most touching thing ever happened to me!

438
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,210
I miss you so much.

439
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,630
Where's mutton? Chicken?

440
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,140
100g lettuce. 30 cal.

441
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,950
100g day lily. 50 cal.

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,260
100g swamp cabbage. 80 cal.

443
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,470
This big feast is only 310 cal!

444
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,630
Feel free to eat!

445
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,890
Any sauce?

446
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,030
Right.

447
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,030
I made this especially for you.

448
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,630
No salt. No spice.

449
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,280
Relax. Zero fat.

450
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's eat!

451
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
Here, have more.

452
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,580
Try that sauce.

453
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,030
Is that nice?

454
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,100
Ye Muxi.

455
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,630
I heard you're ill?

456
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,280
Is that serious?

457
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
Look.

458
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
Can't even speak now.

459
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,260
In fact, these days.

460
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,240
I feel quite sorry for you.

461
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,650
Am I too hard?

462
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,330
I know I shouldn't train you like a boy.

463
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,460
But you know.

464
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,160
I did it for your good.

465
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,530
Every time when it comes to weight.

466
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,960
I am always very serious.

467
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,710
Very stubborn.

468
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,100
I think.

469
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,020
We can start a new plan.

470
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,380
Which will not affect your healthy.

471
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,050
Thank you.

473
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,180
I'll leave first.

474
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,960
There's one more thing.

475
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,150
Still need to keep diet.

476
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,890
Bye then.

477
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,980
Did you bring that?

478
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,170
Don't ask me to bring you snacks.

479
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,260
Didn't you say you want to lose some weight?

480
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,780
You don't know how terrible he is!

481
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,930
He wouldn't let me eat.

482
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,070
Not even a piece of chocolate.

483
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,580
So terrifying!

484
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,640
Aren't you ill?

485
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,460
Who is ill? I'm fine.

486
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,080
So you were lying?

487
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,930
It's not what you think!

488
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,640
- I...I can explain!
- Your conscience won't hurt?

489
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,970
- I didn't...
- Stop saying!

490
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,870
No.

491
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,580
How can you do this to me?!

492
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,390
Your conscience won't hurt?!

493
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,810
No. It's not what you think!

494
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,580
Now, go tell your chocolate.

495
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,170
You're gonna leave it. You hate it!

496
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,060
Come here. Tell it!

497
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,830
Tell it.

498
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,510
You don't like it. You hate it!

499
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,490
You will leave it for good. Say it!

500
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,840
Say it!

501
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,340
I love it.

502
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,050
You love it?

503
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,630
One hundred upward leg swinging!

504
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,530
No!

505
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,910
Chocolate!

506
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,290
Chocolate!

507
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,020
Chocolate!

508
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,060
Wonder girl. Get up. Get up.

509
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,380
Get up and wash your face.

510
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,420
Student Xue is here waiting for you.

511
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,490
Hurry up.

512
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,810
I will wait you downstairs.

513
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,100
It's for you.

514
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,610
It's my secret nutritious breakfast.

515
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,580
Has lots of vitamin, plant fiber.

516
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,670
and lots of protein.

517
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,220
It will wake up your energy for a whole day!

518
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,150
Brother, it's for you.

519
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,430
There's also one for me?

520
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,660
Such a good lad. Good lad.

521
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,300
He has a bright future.

522
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,360
Thank you. I'll drink first.

523
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,710
Fresh!

524
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:27,920
Fresh!

525
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,420
Just one sip.

526
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,960
I feel I'm filled with energy.

527
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,520
If you like it, I'll make you another cup.

528
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,780
I'm good. Xue.

529
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,520
I appreciate it.

530
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,200
I feel I'm filled with energy.

531
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,960
And there's so much possibility in my life.

532
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,040
I've made my mind.

533
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,230
I will do more things for my country.

534
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,870
To devote myself to my country.

535
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,100
Although it's weekend.

536
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,680
But I decide to go to work!

537
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,900
Take care of my sister.

538
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,050
- Brother.
- Thank.

539
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,760
-Brother.
- Bye.

540
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
Brother, take me with you.

541
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,220
Devote myself! It's okay. It's okay.

542
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,060
Devote myself. Devote myself!

543
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,900
Come back.

544
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,820
Drink this. We have more training today.

545
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,810
Come on.

546
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,290
Five more.

547
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,870
Hurry. Up.

548
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,840
Up.

549
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,450
Come on.

550
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
You can do it.

551
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,620
I can't.

552
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,180
You can.

553
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,620
I can't.

554
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,440
You can.

555
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,260
Hurry. Come on.

556
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,880
You can.

557
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,080
One more set.

558
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,250
I can't. I can't.

559
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,750
One more set. You can.

560
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,390
You can.

561
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,250
Can't get up.

562
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,480
Up. Up. Up. Up.

563
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,720
That sofa will drag you down.

564
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
You wanna lose weight or not.

565
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,210
I can't.

566
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,010
Get up. Don't get comfy.

567
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,840
You wanna be fat?

568
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,610
Up. Up. Up. Up.

569
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,060
Hurry, now!

570
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,740
I can't.

571
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,760
Up. Up. Up.

572
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,260
I can't.

573
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,000
Now!

574
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,660
Enough!

575
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,610
Do you wanna watch your concert?

576
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,840
Concert?

577
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,230
Where?

578
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,590
DVD.

579
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,290
But we're doing fitness.

580
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,570
But I have spent a long time finding it.

581
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,450
And I want to watch it so badly.

582
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,220
You really wanna watch it?

583
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,490
Fifteen minutes then.

584
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,390
Yes!

585
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,630
Here, here, here.

586
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,770
Look, right?

587
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,370
It's very hard to find this.

588
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,960
Right? It took me a long time.

589
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
What do you want to drink?

590
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,610
Cold water.

591
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,160
Okay.

592
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,900
In your fridge.

593
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,570
Here.

594
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,050
Thanks.

595
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,830
This.

596
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,200
Never mind. Never mind.

597
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,840
Look, look.

598
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,420
Look at you. So handsome.

599
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,360
The way you shake your hair. Cool!

600
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,930
This move.

601
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,760
Is it hard?

602
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,120
I tried several days but just can't get it.

603
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,220
It's hard.

604
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,620
It took me a long time to learn it.

605
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,430
Look. You really worked hard.

606
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,770
These days.

607
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,150
These days are quite hard.

608
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,210
Always training to late night.

609
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,290
Exhausted, right?

610
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,520
Look, that move.

611
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,440
I think it's time for you to relax.

612
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,080
Look, that move.

613
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,180
Of course you won't be fat.

614
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,490
Recently, my company got me all fully booked.

615
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,080
Right?

616
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
I should relax a little.

617
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,690
Right, relax.

618
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,780
I will teach you how to relax.

619
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,600
You?

620
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,850
Follow me.

621
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,850
Ease your mind.

622
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,910
Close your eyes. Lay back, slowly.

623
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,870
Lay back.

624
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,250
Right.

625
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,150
Breathe in.

626
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,840
All things are disappearing.

627
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,690
Follow the sound.
