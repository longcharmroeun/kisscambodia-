Episode 18

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,690
Why they're all crowded in there?

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,180
What're they looking at?

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,210
Can't see it.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,220
Make them go away then.

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,700
Isn't that the idol Xue Xiaodong?

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,940
Xue Xiaodong!

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,560
Xue Xiaodong!

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,060
Let's go.

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,560
Campus singing competition.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,930
Yes!

41
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,100
They finally decide to hold a nice competition.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,720
This is made for my Xue Xiaodong.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,410
Do you want to participate?

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,860
Rock and roll live forever!

45
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,600
I'd rather be a poet than a singer.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,130
No, no. I can't sing.

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,720
To be honest, I'm interested.

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,640
But never mind.

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,480
It's okay.

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,620
In our class, there're a female and a male cavaliers.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,320
Who is that female?

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,970
Like the one standing here.

53
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,980
Watch me.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,560
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,780
Ye Muxi.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,420
Has anyone told you, you're a great singer?

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,330
No, never.

58
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,060
Don't sing it then.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,420
Wait, I'll show you I'm the best.

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,620
Look, what's writing there?

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,250
English songs only.

62
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,810
All the Chinese songs you know won't be qualified.

63
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,600
What? What the hell?!

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Who said that?

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,560
I feel so sorry about your singing career.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
We're Chinese.

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,020
Why we must sing English songs?

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,770
Oh my lady Gaga.

69
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,580
What?

70
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,780
Don't you know that?

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,120
Let's go.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,210
Anything I can help with, Ye Muxi?

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,940
You're a superstar.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,010
So handsome, sings so beautiful.

75
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,980
You have so many fans.

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,410
I know you will win.

77
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,760
But this competition is also a chance for me to show myself.

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,810
So I wish you can help me.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,770
What're you gonna sing?

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
I've prepared one song.

81
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,850
Okay.

82
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,980
# We will we will rock you #

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,400
Wait.

84
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,100
We've been to KTV together.

85
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,290
I know your style.

86
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,660
But can we try anther style this time?

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
A lyric song, a slow one.

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,570
Let me think.

89
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,810
I have one.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,860
# Hey, I really miss you #

91
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,760
# Now it's raining outside #

92
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,120
# My eyes feel like to cry #

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,130
# I wonder where you are right now #

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,840
Bravo.

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,200
Then, I will sing this one.

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,610
But they said English songs.

97
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,080
Any English Song you can sing?

98
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,370
# You've built a love but that love falls apart #

99
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,640
# Your little piece of heaven turns too dark #

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
# Listen to your heart #

101
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,250
Wait, this ling, one more time.

102
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,680
# Listen to your heart #

103
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,720
One more time.

104
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
# Listen to your heart #

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,220
I know your problem now, Ye Muxi.

106
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,980
Your pronunciation and intonation are good.

107
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,000
But...

108
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,840
My opinion is,

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,500
if you want to win,

110
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,400
you need to go see someone.

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,060
To teach you English.

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm not bragging.

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,450
If you want to learn English.

114
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,810

Right.

118

Here.

119
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,130
Our special way to learn English is to write it down.

120
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,760
And turn it into Chinese.

121
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,410
What about this?

122
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,820
Here, for example.

123
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,980
This one, this line.

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,610
Well, look.

125
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,740

La Ke You (Like you)

127
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,060
What does it mean?

128
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,080
Consider this as a kind of spicy oil.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,820
It's so spicy, makes you thirsty.

130
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,210
Come on, read it.

131

Imagine a kind of very spicy oil.

133
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,340
very spicy oil.

134
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,570
-Okay.
-Now you remember it, right?

135
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,640
-Imagination, come on.

136
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,450
Right, right. next one.

137
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,760
Next one, this line.

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,040
This line is

139
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,450
Sa Mu Wan.

140
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,220
La Ke Mi.

141
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,200
Right, the word Mi is this all about.

142
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,640
Super spicy rice. Makes you thirsty.

143
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,060
I see. I see.

144
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,930

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,800
Spicy rice makes me thirsty.

146
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,570
Rice!

147
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,690
Yes, yes, rice.

148
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,360
La Ke You. La Ke Mi. (Like you. Like me.)

149
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,360
Sing it. Sing it.

150
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,970
# Sa Mu Wan. La Ke You. #(Someone like you)

151
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,540
# Sa Mu Wan. La Ke Mi. #(Someone like me)

152
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,000
Look, you've learned it.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,660
Come on, let's continue.

154
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,660
Lad Danyi.

155
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,400
Can you do me a favor?

156
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,420
No.

157
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,500
You don't know what is that yet.

158
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,440
It's boring anyway.

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,330
You know what should a class committee member do?

160
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,690
To help people.

161
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,290
You're a class committee member as well.

162
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,100
How can you be like this, darling!

163
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,210
What're you doing?

164
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,820
Dear tree. I...

165
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
What do you want?

166
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,620
Aren't you my boyfriend?

167
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,780
Who is your boyfriend?!

168
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,160
Right, pretend.

169
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,780
Shall I tell the whole world

170
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,940
and Guan Xinyi as well.

171
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,450
So she will come after you again.

172
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,820
What a nice scene!

173
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,960
What the hell do you want?

174
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,560
Teach me English.

175
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,980
Let's go back to classroom.

176
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,780
No, I asked Liao Danyi

177
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,140
to teach me English.

178
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,780
Liao Danyi, teach me English.

179
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,900
This one.

180
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,690
Come on!

181
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,130
We

182
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,820
will start from the title.

183
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,760
Follow me.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,700
Someone Like You.

185
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,280
Someone Like you.

186
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,740
Someone Like you.

187
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,380
Someone like you.

188
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,620
Some...some...someone Like you.

189
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,980
Don't sing it along.

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,890
Some...someone like you.

191
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,980
Someone Like you.

192
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,930
Someone Like you.

193
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,260
Someone like you.

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,720
Someone like you.

195
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,740
Let's try another one.

196
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,180
You raise me up.

197
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,500
You rise me up.

198
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,610
I know this one.

199
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,330
Raise.

200
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,020
You rise me up.

201
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,680
Raise.

202
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,160
You rise me up.

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,820
Raise!

204
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,720
You rise me up!

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,410
Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!

206
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,940
Not rise, raise!

207
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,130
You rise me up. Up. Up. Up!

208
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,600
One more time, follow me.

209
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,100
You raise me up.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
Shit.

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,420
That pronunciation is right.

212
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,640
I'll teach you one last time. Raise.

213
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,140
Shit!

214
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,720
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

215
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,740
Shit!

216
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,290
Hi, Danyi.

217
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,500
Brother Yihan.

218
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,170
Yezi, come downstairs. Danyi is here.

219
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,940
Come in, sit.

220
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,890
How are you doing lately?

221
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,280
My study is not bad.

222
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,360
Not bad?

223
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,890
I see you both are so tired.

224
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,810
Come, come, Yezi. Danyi is here.

225
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,260
Danyi, you and Yezi chat here.

226
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,800
I'll get you some snacks.

227
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,090
Thank you, brother Yihan.

228
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,090
You're learning English lately?

229
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,000
Watch me raise!

230
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,700
What will you sing?

231
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,570
You can't sing Laugh in the Ocean.

232
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,500
Haven't figured out yet.

233
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,300
I've found you an easy one.

234
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,010
No, it's not challenging.

235
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,040
So the judge can't see my ability!

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,920
I mean which you can pronounce.

237
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,820
That never worries me.

238
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,900
Listen to me.

239
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,440
# Beat it! #

240
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
# Know you wanna be bad #

241
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,810
# Beat it, Beat it, Beat it, Beat it #

242
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,250
# Beat it! #

243
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,040
# Beat it! #

244
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
Stop! Stop!

245
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Sorry.

246
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,810
What are you singing?

247
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,860
Beat it.

248
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,220
That's beat it.

249
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,250
Or maybe you can sing "Hello".

250
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,450
No, it's too old. No.

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,330
It's classic.

252
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
And the most important is there're two minutes

253
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,740
with no connected speech.

254
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,000
In that way, your English will sound better in one night.

255
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,180
Otherwise, I really can't give any compliment about your English.

256
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,460
Find something cooler.

257
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,940
# Hello from the other side #

258
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,720
Stop.

259
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,280
# Hello from the other side #

260
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,410
Wait, let me get a pen.

261
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,320
How do you pronounce it?

262
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,610
Other side.

263
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,360
Hello, right?

264
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,260
Stop.

265
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,540
Come here.

266
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,690
What're you doing?

267
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,890
You can't remember it like this.

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,650
How can you write it in Chinese?!

269
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,500
The palest ink is better than the best memory.

270
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,100
A De Sai De.

271
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,240
Now let's start to practice English.

272
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,140
Now, sing the song we learned today.

273
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,200
One more time.

274
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,580
# Tell me I want you #

275
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,250
# Tell me I need you #

276
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,810
# Tell me I laugh you #

277
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,740
Stop, stop.

278
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,170
The first two lines are good.

279
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,020
The last three words are "I love you".

280
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,920
I laugh you.

281
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,660
I love you.

282
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,140
Laugh.

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,060
Love.

284
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,970
Laugh.

285
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,250
Watch my mouth. I love you.

286
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,980
I Laugh you.

287
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,960
Love you.

288
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,920
I Laugh you.

289
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,180
I love you.

290
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,250
I love you.

291
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,880
Love.

292
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,370
Laugh. Laugh.

293
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,320
I love you.

294
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,740
Laugh.

295
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,620
You two...

296
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,730
You're away too far!

297
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,020
Stop scrawling.

298
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,410
Let's read some books!

299
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,140
Let's not read this today. Take a break.

300
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,610
Three days fishing and two days resting is not gonna get you there.

301
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
I'm a very good singer.

302
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,370
I have ability and my way doing things.

303
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,920
Is there anything more important than learning singing?

304
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,760
Let's read this.

305
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,100
You try it.

306
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,720
Then we'll decide what we'll sing next.

307
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,100
Die.

308
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,130
Day.

309
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,840
Die.

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,820
Day.

311
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,500
Die.

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,130
Day.

313
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,820
Die.

314
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,400
You wanna die? Day.

315
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait.

316
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,960
Die.

317
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,780
No, it's not gonna work. Too slow.

318
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,760
Class begin. Are you ready?

319
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,100
A B C D E F G

320
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,810
A B C D E F G

321
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,610
A B C D E F G

322
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
Repeat it.

323
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,560
Or how can I teach you?

324
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,360
It's international language.

325
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,450
But you didn't say a word.

326
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,740
This, this figure.

327
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,460
All the people in the world know it means OK.

328
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,120
Ye Muxi. Can you be serious?

329
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,800
I know what shall I sing now.

330
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,140
Okay. You sing it.

331
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,370
# Hello from the other side #

332
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,890
Only this one line, Ha?

333
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,730
That is not gonna help.

334
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,320
I will go meet Xue Xiaodong in his studio, they'll teach me.

335
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,060
More English practice?

336
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,860
Bravo!

337
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,260
Here, let's try it.

338
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,370
# Distance face all around me #

339
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,500
# With no place left to go #

340
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,020
# Just let me carry on #

341
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,620
# Immersed in dreaming my dream #

342
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,180
# Without you within me #

343
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,530
# I find the rest no home #

344
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,520
That's great. Ye Muxi.

345
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,250
I didn't know you can sing that well.

346
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,650
That's exaggerate.

347
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,640
Not at all, ask Liao Danyi.

348
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,840
Is that nice?

349
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,020
Ye Muxi.

350
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,440
It's time for the shower singer to raise.

351
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,020
But you should also practice your pronunciation.

352
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,090
Your special lyric is not professional.

353
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,280
You know nothing about art.

354
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,660
You get up so quick today.

355
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,740
Tomorrow is the mass-election. I must practice tonight.

356
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,320
That's great.

357
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,970
I like that.

358
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,680
I like your attitude.

359
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,130
Remember, give them a big shock tomorrow.

360
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,140
Watch me, I'll be famous.

361
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,570
And I'll make you the golden broker!

362
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,600
Yes!

363
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,360
You can. We can.

364
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,400
We can do it! Okay!

365
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,450
Golden broker.

366
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,930
I'm gonna be a broker!

367
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,020
I can!

368
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,810

Yuan Ke'er, Class Ten, Grade One.

370
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm gonna sing the song "We will rock you".

371
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,050
# We will we will rock you! #

372
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,340
# Rock you! #

373
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,650
Go back. It's terrible. Leave!

374
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,170
Why ring the bell? Why ring the bell on me?

375
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,410
Because it's terrible.

376
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,850
Do you think Rock'n Roll is out of date?

377
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,120
Listen to me.

378
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,260
Rock'n Roll never dies! Rock'n Roll never dies!

379
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,360
Rock!

380
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,120
Rock!

381
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,120
Rock!

Teacher, why ring the bell?

393
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,210
You're too naughty.

394
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,650
We will not let you win.

395

Class Ten, Grade One. Xue Xiaodong.

440
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,290
What? Nervous?

441
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,640
Who? Me? No, not at all!

442

Class One, Grade One. Miss Guan Xinyi.

448
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,420
Guan Xinyi.

449
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,080
Sorry, brother.

450
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
Can I have one minute?

451
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,400
Thank you.

452
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,760
I want to thank all the teachers and students for choosing me.

453
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,930
I'm glad I can make into the final competition.

454
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,700
As you can see it.

455
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,960
I have many chances in my life to stand on the stage.

456
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,940
So I want to give this chance to other students who need it.

457
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,780
So I choose to quit.

458
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,490
Thank you.

459
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,490
Why...why do you...

460
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,770
Well, if Xue Xiaodong quits.

461
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,520

Let's looking forward to it.

469
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,770
Partner?

470
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,840
Big boss, you're right to choose us!

471
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,800
Who are we?

472
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
We have many ideas!

473
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,170
We can sing a lot of interesting songs.

474
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,580
Like "As dance" in localism.

475
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,720
As dance!

476
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,690
It's perfect.

477
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,810
And this.

478
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,780
The Russian version of "Two butterflies"!

479
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,650
And English version of "My Skateboard Shoes" with rap.

480
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,040
That's awesome!

481
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,640
Yes.

482
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,220
Bravo!

483
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,820
We can add more things on our clothes.

484
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,320
Like we can wear some strange costumes!

485
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,340
Calabash Brothers! Calabash Brothers!

486
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,450
And Naruto!

487
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,490
Right, right.

488
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,340
And we can dress like be Matryoshka dolls.

489
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,930
With Bikini.

490
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,330
Right, right.

491
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,690
We can make fun of them.

492
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,820
Last time we threw smoke bombs to them.

493
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,320
And before that.

494
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,930
We can use many colorful smoke shells.

495
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,020
And cast it out. Cast it out.

496
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,930
Right, right, right.

497
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,020
We're so excited even just think of it.

498
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,580
Last time they suffered a lot!

499
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,090
My god, the smoke.

500
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,420
It's great! I love it!

501
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,090
You want some?

502
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,560
No.

503
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,980
Any problem happened to you lately?

504
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,130
None.

505
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,280
Any problem in study?

506
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,370
Ye Muxi.

507
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,240
I will not be your partner in the singing competition.

508
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,660
I didn't ask you to.

509
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,050
Do you need me to?

510
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,700
Yes.

511
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,770
You can go find someone else.

512
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,660
Xue Xiaodong is great.

513
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,380
I want to ask him as well.

514
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,780
But he has quit.

515
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,690
So he can't participate again.

516
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,330
I don't like singing in front of people.

517
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,240
Since you mentioned it.

518
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
Seems I have never heard you sing once since childhood.

519
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,900
How is your singing?

520
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,380
No problem.

521
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,610
Why you won't be my partner?!

522
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,680
I told you, I don't want to.

523
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,170
You should go find someone else.

524
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,560
Fine, I can sing it well without you.

525
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,170
Before the finals.

526
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,810
First I want to announce that,

527
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,860
One participant failed to find a singing partner.

528
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,120
Will be considered as disqualified.

529
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,850
But she insists to sing a song.

530
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,660
Now, may I present Ye Muxi, from Class Ten, Grade Ten.

531
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,090
# Empty space #

532
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,680
# Just fill me up with those holes #

533
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:22,320
# Distance face around me, with no place left to go #

534
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,880
# Just let me carry on #

535
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,380
# Immersed in dreaming my dream #

536
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,610
Before we realized,

537
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,340
Our Yezi has become such a great singer!

538
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,610
I'm so touched!

539
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,360
I wanna try. But I just can't.

540
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,810
Because the emotions is like the ocean.

541
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,520
# I try to carry on #

542
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,090
# My world is half asleep #

543
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:03,180
# I'm an ocean alone without you I'm incomplete #

544
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,580
Are we gonna lose like this?

545
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,240
No, we should be proud even we lose.

546
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:23,040
# I'm an ocean alone without you I'm incomplete #

547
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,700
# Incomplete #

548
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,300
Who is that?

549
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,650
Who is that?

550
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,340
It's Liao Danyi.

551
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,260
Liao Danyi.

552
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,400
Were we wrong about him?

553
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,020
She is not fighting alone?

554
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,730
He is about to sing now?

555
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,820
Let's find out if he has the potential to be an idol.

556
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,170
Come on, Liao Danyi.

557
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,960
Sing, lad!

558
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,650
# Empty space, fill me up with those holes #

559
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:21,740
# Distance face around me, with no place left to go #

560
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,400
# Just let me carry on #

561
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,980
# Immersed in dreaming my dream #

562
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,410
# Without you within me #

563
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:42,050
# I find the rest no home #

564
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,560
# I try to carry on #

565
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,290
# My world is half asleep #

566
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:57,040
# I'm an ocean alone without you I'm incomplete #

567
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,100
I didn't know Liao Danyi is such an awful singer!

568
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,620
It's like killing a pig!

569
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,810
I can't find a word to describe.

570
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:11,240
He...he...he is here to ruin it?

571
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,090
You sit here, I'll kill him.

572
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,280
You...you sit here.

573
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,620
I'll kill him first!

574
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,290
I'll kill him.

575
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Our Xiaodong is the best.

576
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,610
I think it's good.

577
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,330
Quite different.

578
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,090
# Incomplete #

579
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,820
You're welcome.

580
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,520
The fifth are Liao Danyi, Ye Muxi from Class Ten, Grade One.

581
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,200
How is that possible ? We're the last?

582
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,400
They must have decided it earlier.

583
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,760
Have you finished your homework?

584
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,180
No, no, yeah...yeah...

585
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,200
How much have you finished?

586
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,130
Number one to five?

587
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,360
You haven't started right?

588
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,360
What do you want to eat tonight?

589
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,280
All good.

590
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,250
- How about...Hotpot?\ n- Hotpot?

591
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,660
Mercury is retrograde, it's bad luck!

592
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,290
What was your question before?

593
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,420
Date! My date!

594
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,330
Date?

595
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,600
You should conduct yourself well.

596
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,100
Big boss! Hello!

597
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,570
Don't forget.

598
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,300
2 p.m.

599
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,770
- Okay, bye.
- Bye

600
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,920
Listen to me, whatever you say. It's real.

601
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,520
The SpongeBob is not real.

602
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,770
Santa Claus is not real.

603
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,060
- Teletubbies are also....
- They're real!

604
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,120
They don't exist! Not real.

605
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,690
No, I must hold myself.

606
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,610
But the scrawl on the kindergarten wall is just terrible.

607
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,260
Maybe I'll just remould it a little.

608
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,840
Wu Sir.

609
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
What're you doing here?

610
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,690
Nothing.

611
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,320
Nothing?

612
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,420
Help me with the new textbooks.

613
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Let's go.

614
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,200
Wu sir. I'm a young beautiful girl!

615
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,090
Well, I'm a young handsome boy!

616
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,460
- Hello, teacher!
- Wu Sir!

617
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,320
Come on, come on.

618
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,520
Where are we gonna shoot?

619
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,640
We're already here.

620
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Sis, I wanna take a walk.

621
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,680
Okay.

622
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,540
Can you send someone to get us?

623
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,090
Listen to me.

624
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,940
No matter what you say.

625
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,820
It's real!

626
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,850
They're all fake!

627
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,560
Real!

628
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
Fake!

629
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,460
I'm ignoring you.

630
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,330
You're so childish!

631
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,580
I don't care!

632
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,660
You're so boring.

633
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,450
Your wrist must hold like this.

634
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,840
- Like this ?
- Yes, right.

635
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,370
Li Yao.

636
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,810
It's so good to have you to be the action designer of my novel!

637
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,960
Can you repeat it again?

638
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,940
Martial arts are not just words. It's like...

639
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm running late. Running late.

640
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,570
Xiaodong. What a coincidence!

641
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,360
You're also here.

642
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,760
I have something to shoot in here.

643
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,700
I know. No, I don't know.

644
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm just wandering around.

645
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,020
There's a coffee store. I'll show you.

646
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,290
Let's go. Let's go.

647
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,520
You two brats! Listen to me!

648
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,020
I can't catch you.

649
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,620
But don't let me see you at school.

650
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,160
If I see you in school,

651
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,920
I will make sure you two suffer a lot.

652
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,360
Seems we have met so many acquaintances today.

653
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,360
Right.

654
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,010
I still stick to my opinion.

655
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,100
I also stick to my opinion.

656
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,020
I do hate you.

657
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,220
Likewise.
