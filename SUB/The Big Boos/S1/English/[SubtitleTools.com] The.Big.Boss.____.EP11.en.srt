Someone like you.

Sounds good.

34
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,630
Didn't expect that you're such a good singer.

Yes.

you'll sing very well.

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,560
Your majesty.

173
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,780
I have something that I don't know if I should tell you.

174
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,490
Your majesty, I think...

175
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,630
We should end them.

176
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,630
Your majesty, give me ten thousand elite soldiers.

177
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,760
I'll rush on a horse to kill all their family and their clan!

178
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,230
Your majesty, I think it's not a good idea.

179
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,110
Your majesty, who are they?

180
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,000
They're paparazzi.

181
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Throughout history,

182
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,410
no one who has offended them end up well.

183
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,200
For example, that person.

184
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,700
And that person.

185
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,830
Especially, that person.

186
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,980
Which person? Minister Li, make it clear.

187
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,930
So abrasive.

188
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,400
Your majesty, I think I don't need ten thousand elite soldiers.

189
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,060
Give me two hundred average ones.

190
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,730
Once I see them following your majesty's car,

191
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,060
-Your majesty.
-I'll...

192
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,050
Although they're despicable and mean,

193
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,870
your majesty can't do the same thing as they did.

194
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,060
To be frank,

195
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,490
They're low.

196
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,980
But your majesty can't be lower than them, right?

197
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Minister Li, why you always speak for those outsiders?

198
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,780
What did you mean by that?

199
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,030
I'm thinking for her majesty's dignity.

200
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,780
Her majesty's dignity?

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,050
You're just being cowardly!

202
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,360
Your majesty! I must risk my life to tell you this!

203
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,410
Shoot.

204
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,130
Even if I'll have my body smashed into pieces,

205
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,130
I must be loyal to your majesty

206
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,130
and tell you this.

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:42,010
Strong wind, high sky, miserable apes' crying.

208
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,610
Clean islets, white sands, above them birds flying.

209
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,120
Countless leaves keep falling off the trees.

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,370
Endless Yangtze River rises rolling torrents.

211
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,280
Remain to be a traveler far away from home.

212
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:18,730
Sick and alone, climbing stairs in a mirthless autumn.

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,680
Hardships, hatred and bitterness gray the hair.

214
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:34,960
Frustrated, put down this cup of turbid wine.

215
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,760
What you said,

216
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,110
has anything to do with what I'm suffering?

217
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,850
Your majesty, it doesn't.

218
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,960
I just want to show off my talent.

219
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,200
Behead him!

220
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,910
Your majesty, I just want to show off.

221
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,100
Not that serious!

222
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,580
-Shut up. Go.
-Fatuous ruler!

223
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,680
-Fatuous ruler!
-So wise, your majesty.

224
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,590
Sorry, I didn't notice you.

225
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,790
Miss Xinyi!

226
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm here!

227
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,170
Miss Xinyi.

228
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,200
I heard your calling hundreds of meters away.

229
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,050
Please let me handle such kind of trivia.

230
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,570
Go away. Go away.

231
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,940
Sorry.

232
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,740
Miss Xinyi, you can't be more careful.

233
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,590
It's okay if you hurt other people.

234
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,160
But what if you get yourself hurt?

235
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,370
I'll feel heart-broken. Right?

236
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,920
You gotta take good care of yourself, Miss Xinyi.

237
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,130
I've been keeping fit lately.

238
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,350
I'm really very, very tired.

239
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,000
Biceps, triceps, and chest muscles...

240
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,470
Xiaodong, have some water.

241
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,000
This press conference doesn't work out well.

242
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,650
Xiaodong.

243
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,010
To minimize the unfavorable influence,

244
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,930
you must have another press conference.

245
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,290
Again?

246
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,330
Of course.

247
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,060
But, before that,

248
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,100
our crisis PR will help you roll out a series of activities.

249
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,370
Among which,

250
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,110
you'll work with the rising popular star, youths' idol, Angel.

251
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,260
And produce quantities of news.

252
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,870
Angel? Is she much older...

253
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,100
Yes.

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,440
Nowadays, this kind of love is a hottest topic.

255
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,750
Besides, it helps further improve your fame in this trade.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,870
It's the very that we want.

257
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,870
But how will my classmates judge me?

258
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,790
Don't worry about that.

259
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,860
I've discussed with your parents.

260
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,210
Later,

261
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,220
I'll handle the drop-out formalities for you.

262
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,010
What?

263
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,010
If you still want a campus life,

264
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,570
I can help you study abroad a few years later.

265
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,090
It's no problem.

266
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,150
Xiaodong, what I'm doing is for your good.

267
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,590
Drive, move on.

268
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,640
Let me take you to watch the sunset.

269
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,190
Why it blows out again?

270
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,460
You brats, stop right there!

271
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,130
You brats, stop right there!

272
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,990
Stop!

273
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,370
Guan Xinyi, sorry.

274
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,830
My classmates made you suffer this.

275
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,730
During this period of time.

276
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,640
You two keep a distance and stay indoor

277
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,010
as possible as you can.

278
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,250
Then in a few days,

279
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,820
some other news come out.

280
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,880
This thing will be bygones.

281
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,040
Keep practicing. Don't be distracted.

282
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,710
Xue Xiaodong is gonna drop out of school!

283
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,430
So, shall I stop him or not?

284
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,990
Your majesty.

285
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,760
I think, Xue Xiaodong's dropout might be his own will.

286
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,180
This thing might better help his future career.

287
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,980
Meanwhile, it'll save many troubles for your majesty.

288
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,240
Why not let it happen, your majesty?

289
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,830
Your majesty, I don't think it's a good idea.

290
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,560
As Xue Xiaodong's best friend, your majesty

291
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,460
must have felt that Xue Xiaodong is happy in our Class Ten.

292
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,660
So, is his own will to drop out?

293
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,540
If not,

294
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,490
as Xue Xiaodong's best friend,

295
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,740
shouldn't your majesty do something?

296
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,390
Which one of you shall I listen to?

297
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,500
Listen to your majesty yourself.

298
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,190
After all, you're the emperor.

299
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,460
Smile.

300
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,870
Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong!

301
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,110
Smile.

302
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,110
Okay. Okay. Okay.

303
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,390
Be quiet. Be quiet.

304
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,500
Anyway, two popular new stars

305
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,270
will have a very deep cooperation in this movie.

306
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,710
Besides, they're very tacit already.

307
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,250
Next, questions time. You first.

308
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,250
Hi, Xue Xiaodong.

309
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,250
How do you think of Angel?

310
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,530
She's a very nice girl.

311
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,140
We're... Very good friends.

312
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,350
How good? Love at the first sight?

313
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,270
We're very tacit.

314
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,700
Not only at work.

315
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,570
But also in daily life.

316
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,170
Okay. This one.

317
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,530
Xue Xiaodong.

318
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,650
You're gonna drop out of school
because of that affair, right?

319
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,890
That's just a misunderstanding.

320
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,890
We're also considering about his dropout.

321
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,820
After all, Mr Xue Xiaodong's future
is what we value the most.

322
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,670
Thank you.

323
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,360
Since that affair proves to be a misunderstanding,

324
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,140
will you keep in touch with
your classmates, especially that girl?

325
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,510
Xue Xiaodong!

326
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,530
I have something to talk with you.

327
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,700
What's going on?

328
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,760
It's said that you're gonna drop out. Is it true?

329
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,600
Miss...

330
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
Shut up! Let him speak!

331
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,610
Are you afraid that we'll be defamed?

332
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,630
It's okay. We suffer that every day.

333
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,100
Yes! We're not afraid of that!

334
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,470
We have no fame anyway!

335
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,050
I've been defamed since childhood.

336
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,710
But I got over it.

337
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,920
But if you're really afraid of that,

338
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,250
I'll feel disappointed at you.

339
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,030
You're the strongest man I've ever known.

340
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,190
You even can beat your fat.

341
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,960
What else can't you beat?!

342
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,790
I want to hear what's really in your mind.

343
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,680
In fact, I don't want to leave this school at all.

344
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't want to leave my classmates.

345
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,560
I also don't want to take part into this movie.

346
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,680
In fact, me and Angel...

347
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,330
Not familiar.

348
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
About work,

349
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,750
I want to fulfill it in my spare time after school.

350
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,320
I really love my classmates in Class Ten, Grade Ten.

351
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,020
I only want to stay in my Class Ten.

352
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,510
Together with you guys.

353
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,810
Because I really love my classmates.

354
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,150
Because I really love...

355
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,810
Study.

356
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,270
I also love study!

357
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,700
-I also love study!
-I also love study!

358
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,030
I... I don't love study.

359
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,300
You must say it.

360
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,050
I love study!

361
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,120
Friends from media.

362
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,130
Actually we're not here for a launch event.

363
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,600
Let bygones be bygones.

364
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,390
In fact, we're here to clarify
Mr. Xue Xiaodong's affair problem.

365
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,900
As you see,

366
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,680
Xiaodong and his classmates are on good terms.

367
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,680
He cherishes this friendship.

368
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,710
So,

369
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,220
for those who try to defame Xiaodong,

370
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,140
we're responding with legal measures.

371
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,440
Xiaodong, we'll always stand on your side.

372
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,410
Sis Annie.

373
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,660
Okay. Let's call it a day now.

374
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,190
Go find them. Leave this to me.

375
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,570
I'm your broker!

376
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,810
Xue Xiaodong, say something more.

377
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,050
Don't leave.

378
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,650
Don't leave. Say something more.

379
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,650
Just stop right here!

380
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,510
Stop right here!

381
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,570
It's over now.

382
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,850
Haven't I given you bonus?!

383
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,170
Stop right here!

384
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,020
It's over already.

385
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,160
How many times have I told you that?!

386
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Can we interview you more?

387
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,060
That hurts.

388
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,250
Buddha's Palm.

389
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,250
Name the move before you hit me.

390
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,540
Look at me. Look at me. Look.

391
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,790
What's up?

392
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,880
Am I losing weight?

393
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,540
Don't ask such a question.

394
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,070
Look, thanks to you,

395
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,530
I'm gaining weight lately.

396
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,570
Have lunch with Xue?

397
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,280
Don't read it aloud.

398
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,520
Can we have lunch together?

399
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,610
Okay.

400
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,960
He says okay.

401
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,680
It's your shampoo.

402
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,500
Yes, my shampoo.

403
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,080
The mutton should be done.

404
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,780
This tastes very good.

405
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,910
Which one?

406
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,470
You...

407
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,570
How could you eat hot pot at school?!

408
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,940
Is this against school rules?

409
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,930
You...

410
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,180
Liao Danyi, would you like to join us?

411
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,030
No need. I've got something else to do.

412
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,310
Excuse me.

413
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,920
-Hot pot.
-So delicious.

414
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,990
Liao Danyi.

415
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
You really don't want to know
what I'm gonna tell you?

416
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,240
Do you know it already?

417
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,390
You're pretending that you don't
or you really don't?

418
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,570
Sorry, I've got something else to do.

419
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,160
Liao Danyi.

420
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,600
I gotta tell you this even if you don't want to hear it.

421
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,770
I must say it today.

422
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,380
I don't care about the vibe and stuff.

423
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,850
I don't care whether I look nice or not today.

424
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
I gotta tell you, Liao Danyi.

425
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,500
Liao Danyi, I...

426
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,170
Liao Danyi, I...

427
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,520
Shut up!

428
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,950
You, back off, keep steering the wheel.

429
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,210
Turn left. Keep steering.

430
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,210
Back off. Back off. Back off.

431
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,210
Move, that way.

432
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,420
Okay, stop.

433
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,050
And you, move on.

434
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,720
You, come here.

435
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,780
It seems that we have a worse vibe now.

436
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,820
But still I gotta tell you this.

437
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,010
Liao Danyi,

438
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,810
I love you.
