You've changed

Classmate Liao Danyi

123
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,070
Disperse from here

124
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,180
Classmate Ye Muxi

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,700
What were you arguing about?

126
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,790
It's none of your business. Go away

127
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,020
Sorry, I didn't think about your 'business'

128
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,120
Where are you going, Liao Danyi?

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
My driver is just around the corner

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,060
I'll give you a ride

131
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,800
No, thank you

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,440
I'll just cycle by myself

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Oh, I see

134
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Liao Danyi

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,700
You're in such a hurry to go out with me

136
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,820
Aren't you going to have hot pot with me?

137
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,380
What ..... hot pot?

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,260
Oh yeah

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,860
Let's hurry and eat

140
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,360
Let's go

141
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,580
Wait a minute

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are you going? I'm going, too

143
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Why?

144
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,430
Because the school said

145
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,960
In order to prevent students from adolescent rash love

146
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,940
Boys and girls can't go out and play together

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,620
So, wherever you are going,  I'm going too

148
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,700
Right here??

149
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,880
What's up

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,600
Not used to such places

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,940
If you're not used to food here, then do not eat

152
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
For the sake of work, well..

153
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,860
I can do it

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Pretty girls, handsome boy

155
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,000
Welcome to our house

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,780
We are the most delicious shop on this street

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,340
Look at this! We have a new product recently

158
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,220
Take what you want, though

159
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,680
Meet all your requirements

160
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,720
Some meat, vegetables and wine

161
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,140
There's no need for wine

162
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,960
No problem, no problem

163
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,960
These are children of rich families

164
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Really!

165
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,880
With what kind of person?

166
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
You can only come to this kind of place?

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,540
You're being too whiny

168
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,180
Don't eat if you do not want to

169
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,700
Actually, it's not just eating

170
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,040
This is true in life

171
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,520
What are the people around you in your life?

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,180
What will you become?

173
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,840
What do you mean?

174
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,520
Classmate Ye Muxi

175
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,020
No

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Monitor Ye Muxi

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Have you ever heard such a sentence?

178
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,470
Good and straight

179
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,120
White sands are black in Nirvana

180
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,620
I forgot. You are in class ten

181
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,040
Of course you won't understand that

182
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,620
Landlady, definitely

183
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,960
there is no meat left

184
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,940
We are hungry. Here, here!!

185
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,400
Liao Danyi classmate

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,920
I'll give you lamb piece

187
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Here you are

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,340
No, thanks

189
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,880
I don't like mutton

190
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
Oh, I see

191
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
Good

192
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,540
Liao Danyi loves my words. Take this meat, eat till all is finished.

193
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,480
That's a good thing

194
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,890
It's been a day with you. I should be going

195
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,660
There must be a secret for such a hurry

196
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,000
Mr Driver,  we have to do what we often see on TV

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,380
Things that are not to be seen in reality

198
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,020
Just keep up with that car

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,560
Pearl nursing home

200
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,990
What's this guy doing here?

201
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,040
It is necessary to investigate

202
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,340
I beat and beat

203
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,300
I hit you, beat you

204
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,340
Where are you running to?

205
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,340
Beat you, beat you, I beat you, beat you

206
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Where do run to?

207
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,680
Stop, I'll beat you

208
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,920
I hit you, I hit you, I beat you

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Wait a minute

210
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,780
I don't know who you are

211
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,240
I don't know why you hit me

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,400
But you beat me again I will fight back

213
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,520
If I hadn't stopped you in time

214
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,440
Your conspiracy will have succeeded

215
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,960
You oppress people. Misgovernment makes people rebel

216
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,860
People have to turn their backs

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,260
Only Zorro, that's our hero

218
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,960
I cannot understand you

219
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,620
Why are you here?

220
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,580
I followed you

221
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,340
Are you sick?

222
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
You be careful

223
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,900
The old grandmother is as mad as a mad dog

224
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,560
running to bite

225
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,520
Shut your big mouth

226
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,800
Grandma, are you all right?

227
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,490
Grandma..

228
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,440
She hit me

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,300
Grandma began this kind of symptom a few years ago

230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,260
She is sober sometimes

231
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,890
But most of the time

232
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,490
There is no difference between reality and fantasy

233
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,140
You come and see her every week

234
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
I never saw it in you

235
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,970
Deep filial piety

236
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,330
What's this?

237
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,020
Zorro, a very classic movie

238
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,680
You can't have never seen it

239
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,080
Is it nice?

240
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,960
You don't see him as a governor

241
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Silly girl

242
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,560
In fact, he is a hero

243
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,080
He has deserted his beloved girl

244
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Riding his horse Bordeaux

245
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,580
He's called Zorro everywhere

246
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,860
He took to chivalry

247
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,040
So touched!

248
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
So handsome!

249
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,100
Deeply touched!

250
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
So moving!

251
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,960
Who are you?

252
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,780
Spy at tower

253
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,400
No, grandma

254
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,760
Grandma

255
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,020
Grandma

256
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,620
This technique

257
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,660
Dan Yi

258
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,660
Grandma recognized me

259
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,940
Dan Yi

260
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,170
Dan Yi, why don't you talk to your dad

261
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
if he doesn't want to take
care of me?

262
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,580
Just leave him alone

263
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,780
You see, put me in this place

264
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,960
Join the gang every day

265
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I'm not happy, you know?

266
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,450
I can rent out for myself

267
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,920
I can make money by myself

268
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
I can support myself

269
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,220
I won't give him any trouble

270
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,400
Do you know?

271
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,220
OK

272
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,300
Did you hear?

273
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,780
Grandma, please do not talk nonsense

274
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,080
How is what I have said, nonsense?

275
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,640
My great grandson

276
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm sober now

277
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,780
How do you fold your clothes?

278
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
I'll teach you

279
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,070
Fold up

280
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,480
Why are you so stupid?

281
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,320
The first step is wrong

282
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Do this

283
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,400
Then fold it up

284
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
Why are you so stupid?

285
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,180
You grew up together with Dan Yi, right?

286
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,460
You two are still classmates?

287
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,400
How many people are there in your family?

288
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,700
Are your parents well to do?

289
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,120
What kind of house do you live in?

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,460
Commercial housing or low-cost housing ah?

291
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,060
How about mom and dad's income?

292
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,820
What do they do?

293
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Is it a civil servant or a business man?

294
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,390
You said just now

295
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,260
You grew up with our family, Dan Yi

296
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,860
And now with he's in school with you

297
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,440
as classmate?

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,020
Right

299
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,320
Nonsense

300
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,120
Really!

301
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,360
You're not afraid of me, are you?

302
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,660
Here's something for you to see

303
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Do you fear me now?

304
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,580
Then tell me the truth

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,260
How's your family doing?

306
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,320
Especially good

307
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,680
That's good

308
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,320
Then what do your parents do?

309
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,900
Are they blue collar or white collar workers?

310
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,040
They are public servants of the state

311
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
Or the average wage earners?

312
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,200
Why do you want to ...

313
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
No, I don't think so

314
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,780
I told you to try my best

315
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,100
Saves you from talking nonsense

316
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,180
What kind of house do you live in?

317
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,540
Do you rent it or do you buy it?

318
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,400
Is this a bank mortgage?

319
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,340
Or a lump sum payment?

320
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,920
Can't tell it. Cheat.

321
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I don't like you

322
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,350
You say you are doing well now?

323
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,960
Yeah

324
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,460
Can you pass?

325
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,420
Pass

326
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,140
You can't pass the exam

327
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,640
Where is light passing?

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,620
You know what?

329
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Our family, Dan Yi, ever since he was small

330
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,040
He is the lord in school

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,040
From when he was small till now

332
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,860
He has been the class monitor, okay?

333
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,020
He is not the monitor

334
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,120
That's impossible

335
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,900
Who's the monitor then?

336
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,400
I am

337
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,740
You are the monitor?

338
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,720
Right

339
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,340
Honest confession -
How did you do at school?

340
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Very good

341
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,880
Very good?

342
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
Especially good

343
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,180
Can you pass each grade exam?

344
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,880
Pass

345
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,080
Pass?

346
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,660
The light and the grid, and our family, Dan

347
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,800
The difference is not ten, eight Street

348
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,920
Do you know if our family is happy?

349
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
The leading lord in kindergarten

350
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,240
Now in the class or the largest department

351
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
Lord of the squad

352
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm the monitor

353
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,560
Now it's me. I'm the monitor

354
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,620
You are the monitor

355
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,320
Yeah

356
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,060
Nonsense

357
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,200
No, I did not tell you much

358
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,740
How could you be?

359
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,420
Because I'm stronger than your grandson

360
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Come in

361
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,920
Doctor, how's my grandmother doing now?

362
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,880
It's hard for us, too

363
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,690
You know, the old lady often has delusions

364
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,740
Our whole hospital is in general turmoil

365
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
She was bruised and scorched by flames

366
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,940
Doctor, I know the state of my grandmother too

367
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,560
Sometimes the brain doesn't work

368
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
but sometimes, she is sober too

369
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,820
Do you get it?

370
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
When is she sober?

371
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,660
Better not sober up

372
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,320
I said that Yang Yang

373
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,100
You run here every day

374
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,140
What does that mean?

375
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,480
Running around and around

376
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,240
You have to wear goggles

377
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,200
This ditch is like our home

378
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,920
That donkey grinds

379
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Running round and round

380
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,060
How tiring!

381
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
Don't you just want to live a few more years?

382
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,160
What can you live and do?

383
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,340
It's not running around and around

384
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,640
Why don't you run around Yang?

385
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,540
Me too. I'll just tell you a few words

386
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
It's boring

387
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,120
You never joke

388
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,920
Lao Li!
You see that Huang

389
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
She doesn't know what to think

390
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,220
At her age

391
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,540
She bought a pink coat

392
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,860
Came a pink flower

393
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,540
After that?
She bought a green sweater

394
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,920
More soil and more soil

395
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,480
I wouldn't have done that anyway

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Others just give me these

397
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,780
I'm not at home

398
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,200
I don't think you're so old

399
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,440
Zhao

400
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,320
Zhao Zhao Zhao

401
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,160
Sit, sit, sit

402
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
I know your brain doesn't work

403
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,660
But here's a letter

404
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,240
Zorro was important hero

405
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,220
He represents the safety of the people

406
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,500
Here you are, keep watch

407
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,080
Someone's coming to connect with you in a minute

408
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm busy

409
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,660
Never go!

410
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,060
Yes, it's difficult for us, too

411
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,700
How could there be such a grandmother?

412
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,380
Do what you want

413
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,660
Regardless of other people's feeling

414
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
It's hard to make friends

415
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Look at what I do

416
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,890
Have a face to say

417
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Eat it

418
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
I'll eat first

419
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,360
Eat with your elders

420
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
You haven't moved your chopsticks yet, so you dare move your chopsticks

421
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,640
The elders are present

422
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,620
One who is hungry must endure

423
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,320
Where can you eat first?

424
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,000
No etiquette

425
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,420
Sit and sit. Straight waist

426
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
The honorable ones have honor

427
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,360
Eat to have the appearance of eating, do you understand or not?

428
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Eat if you like

429
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,310
How do you use these chopsticks?

430
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,560
No one in your family taught you, did you?

431
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,060
Take it well

432
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,820
Such a big girl!

433
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,800
Eat vegetables first, know or do not know. Do not start with meat

434
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,820
You see, you see

435
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,080
You see what you eat like that

436
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
Are you a piggy?

437
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,160
Hang up

438
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,220
Don't be hungry like a hungry prisoner just released

439
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,120
Do you even know how to keep your body decent and dignified?

440
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,020
Where do you put your hands? Where do you put them?

441
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,840
The waist is falling again

442
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,060
Don't eat meat alone

443
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,240
Listen, these are vegetables

444
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,980
Vitamin C

445
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,760
Vitamin ABCDEFG, all up to W

446
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,120
What nutrients are there?

447
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,340
Little girl

448
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,120
How did they raise her at home?

449
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,720
Look at you

450
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,060
How you make sounds with mouth while eating

451
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,600
Like a pig
That's the sound of pigs eating

452
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,800
You're a girl

453
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,520
Who wants a girl like this?

454
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,840
No one is willing to accept such a daughter-in-law

455
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm full

456
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Finish eating

457
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,800
No waste of grain. Eat well

458
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,620
OK, look, you're eating well

459
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,580
Finish up all these vegetables

460
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,540
Dan Yi!

461
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,160
Yeah, grandma

462
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,620
Have you heard?

463
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,040
Uncle Wang, his family, Xiao Zi

464
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,790
That's only three months since he got married

465
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,410
Got depression

466
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,920
Jumped down from the sixth floor

467
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,070
I heard that it was because of his unfaithful wife

468
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,020
What else?

469
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
Uncle yuan, the eldest son of their family

470
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,440
University Graduate

471
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,060
As a result, the daughter-in-law failed to find a good one

472
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,660
He's not dead
His mother died of pesticide poisoning

473
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,120
You see what this is all about, really

474
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,900
What do you want to say, grandma?

475
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,680
I just wanted to talk to you

476
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,140
The wrong partner will ruin a man forever

477
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,460
I don't like it, Dan Yi
Grandma just wanted to caution you

478
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,560
Finding wrong partner means regret forever

479
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,400
What's this? No, I lost it.

480
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,840
How dare you throw my things?

481
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,880
Oh, I see

482
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,900
You just came to the baby in my box. Is it?

483
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,380
What's this?

484
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,420
Let me talk to you

485
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,540
You can't throw it out of my box, as long as I still have one last breath remaining

486
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,280
Grandma!

487
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,440
I don't have a grandmother. I don't have one.              Calm down

488
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,160
Calm down

489
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,660
I tell you

490
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,180
This is very painful, do you know?

491
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,720
You're stupid or normal, I don't know

492
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,640
I told you

493
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,320
If you hit me again, I will

494
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,980
Calm down Calm down

495
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,040
Good

496
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,820
How could you be with her?

497
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,940
You're on her side

498
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,300
You're facing her

499
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,280
Since you all said I was crazy, I'm crazy

500
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,700
You are all spies

501
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,200
Get out of here!

502
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,180
Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here

503
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,300
Get out of here!

504
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,740
Grandma!

505
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,120
I really don't know why

506
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,820
I'm such a lovely girl

507
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,300
Why am I hated by your grandma?

508
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,400
I do not know either

509
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,300
My grandma is very friendly to young people

510
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,260
I  do not know why she hates you

511
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,040
Because she didn't see my lovely side

512
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm going to see her now

513
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,760
Wait a minute

514
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,540
You should stop looking for her

515
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,060
I'm going to get some medicine for my grandmother now

516
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,230
Come back later, let's go back together

517
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,790
What's wrong with me?

518
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,040
I'm cute

519
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,700
Ye Muxi, are you lovely?

520
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,960
I think I'm cute

521
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,270
That's right

522
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
Doctor

523
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,020
Do you think I'm cute?

524
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,980
Yes, you're lovely

525
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,380
Yes!! Take it, take it
I'm going to find Liao Danyi now

526
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,300
Grandma

527
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,860
Dear

528
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,320
May the letters remind you of me

529
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,020
Although we are separated by the trials of a long journey

530
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,140
But I'm reading your letters all the time

531
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,760
March thirteen is our wedding anniversary

532
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,400
We were one of the few couples who held western style
weddings in those days

533
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,740
I will always remember

534
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,480
That day, you looked so beautiful in your wedding dress

535
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,500
March thirteen

536
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,920
Isn't that today?

537
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,000
How did the patient come here?

538
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,100
She came here so suddenly today

539
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,800
Hurry up and deal with it

540
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,020
Liao granny, you're dressed here

541
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,140
Lifted the bed sheets alone

542
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,320
Shall we go back for an injection?

543
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,280
An injection!

544
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,540
Don't play, don't play

545
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
It's okay, no problem

546
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,360
Go back to get the injection, okay?

547
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,060
I'm serious

548
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,680
An injection!

549
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,200
It's a small injection

550
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,900
Don't play, don't play

551
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
It's okay, no problem

552
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,920
Grandma

553
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Sorry for being late.

554
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,780
What are you doing here?

555
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,980
These my flowers to her

556
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,500
But I didn't get to buy flowers

557
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,980
So use this pot instead

558
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,640
Today is my grandma's wedding anniversary

559
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,860
Give her some wedding photos

560
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,260
How did she come out dressed in bed sheets?

561
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,020
Great

562
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,720
No, it's a fashionable wedding dress

563
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,220
How can you call this just 'bed sheets'?

564
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,900
Nice!

565
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,500
Good looking!

566
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,820
It feels nice to look good

567
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,080
Nice!

568
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
Isn't something wrong with that?

569
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,750
No, I don't see anything

570
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,160
But the granny with the sheets on her face

571
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,100
Grandma

572
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,940
So beautiful

573
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,140
Look

574
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,520
Grandma, let's go

575
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,940
You're Zorro

576
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,950
Yes

577
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
I am Zorro

578
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,120
I'm sorry I kept myself hidden from you

579
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,200
Why do you lie to me every time?

580
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,720
What are you doing?

581
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,580
Deceive me less

582
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,480
You do it every time

583
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,500
You cheat me, cheat me, cheat me

584
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,980
You die, liar, liar!
