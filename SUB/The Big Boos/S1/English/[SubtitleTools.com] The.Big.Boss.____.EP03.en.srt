00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,400
The bell is about to ring in...

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,420
Ten.

4
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,440
Nine.
Ten.

00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,450
Nine.

00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,310
Eight.

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,970
Seven.

00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,650
Six.

Two.

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,050
One.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,800
[ Class is over ]

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,410
Why?!!

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,250
Why the bell doesn't ring?

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,980
Time's up already.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,660
Teacher didn't realize that?

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,870
Monitor, I hear the bell rings.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,610
Leave with other classmates.

21
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,790
What did he say? I can't hear him.

22
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,370
My ears are bombed to deaf.

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,130
Monitor, the bell has rung!

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,090
I didn't hear that!

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,290
Did you hear that?

26
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,710
Did the bell ring?

27
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,090
I didn't hear that.

28
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,330
Anyone else heard that?

29
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,280
Monitor, we all listen to you all the time.

30
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,920
This time, please listen to me.

31
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,920
Leave with other brothers.

32
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,300
Or the next class will begin.

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,670
Speak louder.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,500
Monitor, he said that the bell really had rung!

35
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,080
If you don't leave now, the next class will begin!

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,430
Liao Danyi

37
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,680
You're Commissary in charge of studies.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,520
Tell me.

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,750
Did you hear the bell?

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,130
No, I didn't.

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,830
Liao Danyi, you bastard!

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,830
You're gonna kill us!

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,960
I didn't hear that, either.

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,630
How dare you!

45
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,930
Whoever acts recklessly, I'll kill him!

46
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,700
Xue Xiaodong!

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,530
Everyone here attend class like you do!

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,980
Don't act like some hero here!

49
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,410
Cheng Ling... Cheng Ling just wants to delay

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,970
a few minutes of our break.

51
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,520
Cheng Ling.

52
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,860
Cheng Ling.

53
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,930
Take him away.

54
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,930
Leave a place for me beside him.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,880
Whoever heard the bell may leave.

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,160
I won't stop you.

57
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,690
Those who didn't,

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,210
come with me.

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,630
Go carry bombs.

60
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,980
I felt that.

61
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,220
I felt that the next class is gonna begin.

62
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,780
The bell will not ring.

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,690
Shanqi...

64
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,810

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,580
Huang Nan, Huang Yi.

Cheng Ling.

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,280
My brothers left just like this.

69
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,380
And I'm gonna see them soon.

70
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,590
I think I can hear...

71
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,900
That bell rings silvery when class is over.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,710
I can see our classmates' happy faces.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
That moment is so wonderful, so pure.

74
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,870
Ye Muxi. Monitor.

75
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,590
Sorry.

76
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,170
I think I was wrong about you.

77
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,380
I always think you're a secondary high school student.

78
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,200
Once the teacher delays to dismiss,

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,770
you'll shout and make a fuss.

80
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,640
Or even run out of the classroom as a slacker.

81
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,470
But ever since you became the monitor,

82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,650
you really have changed a lot.

83
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,110
I'm proud of you!

84
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,450
I'm the monitor.

85
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
I should stay here even if others don't.

86
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,860
It's been seven minutes.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,080
Sorry, I didn't hear the bell.

88
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,430
So, now class is over.

89
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,800
But, no need to stand up.

90
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,480
Okay. Class is over.

91
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,220
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

92
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,690
Class is over!

93
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,070
Class is over!

94
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,070
We can go out now! We can go out!

95
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,200
Guys, that...

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,620
Let's begin the class three minutes earlier.

97
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,110
We...

98
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,620
Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi!

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,390

100
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,940

# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,410
# Waiting, the signal for running #

Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong!

132
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,870
My god, why so many people?

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,880
Xue Xiaodong goes to a reality show in the weekend.

134
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,500
It's said on websites that he'll pass by here.

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,730
Then this happens.

136
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,450
Don't panic. Listen to me.

137
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,720
We have limited guards in our school.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,970
And we can't play rough to drive them away.

139
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,770
But try our best to mediate.

140
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,040
As... As the new president of the Student Union,

141
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,190
I gotta try my best to solve this problem.

142
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,690
Make sure our students won't be stopped outside the school gate!

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,990
So sleepy.

144
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,290
I'm tired, too.

145
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,590
I can tell that.

146
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,500
Hurry. Hurry.

147
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,320
Pretend that I've told you a funny joke.

148
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
Why... Why?

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
That doesn't matter. Hurry, right now.

150
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,420
Hi.

151
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,030
Hi.

152
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,200
He smiles to me. He smiles to me!

153
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,090
Can we take a picture?

154
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you. Okay.

155
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,380
A few days ago, on the honors day,

156
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,950
he's sung songs, super handsome!

157
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
Two days ago,

158
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,580
he didn't come to attend class because of the concert.

159
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,580
Today's his first day at school.

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,580
I see.

161
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,550
In fact, listen,

162
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,560
many people say, although our class is not some key class,

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,540
it's pretty lucky to be in the same class

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,040
with two princes charming.

165
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,040
Another prince charming, who's he?

166
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,630
Liao Danyi.

167
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,870
Wait.

168
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,340
Are you kidding me?

169
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
Liao Danyi?

170
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,210
Anything wrong with that?

171
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,280
Liao Danyi is handsome and good at studying.

172
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,680
The most important thing is,

173
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,540
he gives out an intellectual aura.

174
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,530
He's very popular among girls.

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,440
How could you guys think he's a prince charming?

176
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,960
Are you blind? Or I'm blind? Or the world is blind?

177
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,840
Who's blind?

178
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,330
This must be my spot.

179
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,170
Hi.

180
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,960
Hi, I'm Ye Muxi.

181
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,500
Hi, I'm Xue Xiaodong.

182
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,140
Hi, I'm Zhu Shanqi. We've met before.

183
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,970
Well, I've something to discuss with you.

184
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,210
About your fans...

185
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,190
Sorry, I've told them on Facebook.

186
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,930
They say they won't come again.

187
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,300
That's okay. I just...

188
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,880
Anything I can help you with, Ye Muxi?

189
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,490
Have I seen you on TV?

190
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,570
Recently I always show up on TV and websites.

191
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,510
You should have seen me a lot.

192
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,620
Not recently. Maybe in the past...

193
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,720
Your look and the way you talk...

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,700
You... Have you been on TV in your childhood?

195
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,840
No, I haven't.

196
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,320
I think you get a wrong person.

197
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
But I really feel that you look so familiar.

198
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,040
It has something to do with hula hoop and the stuff...

199
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,040
I said no. I haven't.

200
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,120
Excuse me.

201
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,370
What's wrong?

202
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,880
What did you do to him?

203
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,070
Nothing.

204
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,800
Sister Annie, did you hear that?

205
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,160
Xiaodong, rest easy.

206
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,980
I've heard that.

207
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,460
We'll start the operation right now.

208
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,650
Get all people ready!

209
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,960
Release first-class red alarm!

210
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,690
Quiet. Attentive.

211
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,150
Most efficient.

212
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,730
This is the unique learning vibe of Class One.

213
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,800
Of course.

214
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,110
Class One is the best class in Maple Leaf Middle School.

215
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,670
Even between classes, we're preparing for study.

216
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,030
No one shouts or makes noise in the corridor.

217
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,450
As for other classrooms,

218
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,450
everyone has already run away.

219
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
Wait.

220
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,150
This attentive feel...

221
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,540
How could anyone who's not a student of Class One

222
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,910
give out such an attentive learning force between classes?

223
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,280
Who's this guy?

224
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,000
To sum it up.

225
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,500
Moonlight In The Lotus Pond, its main idea is...

226
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,340
Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong!

227
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,740
Its main idea is...

228
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,890
Brother Xiaodong! Brother Xiaodong! Xiaodong Oppa!

229
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,660
So, Xiaodong Oppa's main idea...

230
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,100
Xue Xiaodong's fans disturb classes.

231
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,250
Please go solve it.

232
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,840
Mr. Wu...

233
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,680
You can tell him yourself directly.

234
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,690
Me?

235
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,890
I'm your teacher!

236
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,430
I've lots of things to do every day.

237
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,430
Look, how busy I am!

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,660
Here, gimme.

239
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,190
Pass it to me.

240
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,120
Pass it to me.

241
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,320
Xue Xiaodong.

242
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,980
This is...

243
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,080
This is the theme song of my new album.

244
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,630
I sang it to you on impulse.

245
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,700
Do you like it?

246
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,700
On impulse?

247
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,700
What about the lamplight and dancing...

248
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,420
Those don't matter.

249
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,400
What matters is, please remember who I am,

250
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,330
as an idol, okay?

251
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,720
I must have seen you somewhere!

252
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,150
Not now. But in the past.

253
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,730
Something to do with hula hoop.

254
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,230
Stop dancing!

255
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,770
Where are you going? This...

256
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,300
Damn it. The plan didn't work out?

257
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,860
All staffs retreat right now.

258
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,410
Get ready for Plan B.

259
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
Excuse me, girls.

260
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,030
Xiaodong!

261
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,880
Xiaodong, I wanted to ask you this a long time ago?

262
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,170
Can I take a picture with you?

263
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,250
Can I friend you on Facebook and @ you?

264
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,770
Yes. Yes. You bet.

265
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,980
This is a snack I made by myself.

266
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,380
Hope you guys love it.

267
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,470
My first work.

268
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,790
Snack?

269
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,590
Xiaodong, you're really...

270
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,390
Really... Sweet.

271
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,790
I can make you more next time if you love it.

272
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,970
And, two tickets to my concert.

273
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,970
You can come with your friend.

274
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,320
Xiaodong, you're so nice!

275
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,240
Ye Muxi, I'm here for you.

276
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,170
Me?

277
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,490
Have time for an afternoon tea?

278
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,970
Yes.

279
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,550
I'll wait upstairs, then.

280
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,030
What's the matter?

281
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,510
I don't know, either.

282
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,670
You're sure that you don't know?

283
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,300
It's okay, then.

284
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,170
Tell me if there's anything coming out.

285
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,170
What... What were you gonna do with the scissors?

286
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,480
Eyebrow trimming.

287
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,540
Looks so delicious.

288
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,750
Tastes like happiness.

289
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,290
Shanqi, why are you also here?

290
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,810
I heard you called her.

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
I felt very happy, too.

292
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,860
So I came as well.

293
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,060
Sit.

294
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,790
Does it sound good, Ye Muxi?

295
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,790
Yes. Yes. Supper good!

296
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,870
Not bad.

297
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,250
So, have any impression on me now?

298
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,750
The impression was very profound in the first place.

299
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,980
So you haven't seen me on TV, get it?

300
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,880
I must have seen you!

301
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,940
I almost remember that!

302
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,030
Yes. Yes. Yes.

303
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,310
It must have something to do with hula hoop.

304
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,170
Can't you just forget that?!

305
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,890
Can't remember the way I look right now?

306
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,900
Or I don't look good enough right now?

307
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,450
Can you remember me?

308
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,230
For my entire life.

309
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,370
My entire life.

310
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,890
It... It still has something to do with hula hoop.

311
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,500
So handsome even he's mad.

312
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,540
Miss Xinyi, what are you looking at?

313
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,370
Transcripts of simulative high school entrance exams.

314
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,070
Look, in the three exams,

315
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,070
there's always one doing better than me.

316
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,500
But he's not in our class.

317
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,570
Look, this student.

318
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,790
Liao Danyi.

319
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,440
I know this idiot.

320
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,840
It's said that he missed an exam.

321
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,330
So, now he's in the worst Class Ten.

322
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,200
In this case, he can make up for the missed exam.

323
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,630
Why he didn't?

324
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I don't know the details.

325
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,340
But isn't it good in this way, Miss Xinyi?

326
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,610
You'll always be number one in our class.

327
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,400
What do you know?

328
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,350
Only the most excellent ones get together,

329
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,670
can we be motivated to make progress.

330
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,100
Yes.

331
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,710
Liao Danyi...

332
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,030
Ye Muxi.

333
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,880
You're gonna sing and dance again?

334
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
You wanna know where you've seen me, right?

335
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,520
Come with me.

336
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,990
To where?

337
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,410
The auditorium.

338
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,070
Xue Xiaodong, why did you bring me here?

339
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,890
I've had enough of this feeling.

340
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,050
What feels worse than being shot is living at gunpoint.

341
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,230
You keep recalling where you've seen me, right?

342
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,090
Look this.

343
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,420
Three circles left. Three circles right.

344
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,010
Shake your neck. Shake your butt.

345
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,570
I got it!

346
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,980
You're that hula hoop fat boy!

347
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,210
Yes, I'm the hula hoop fat boy.

348
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,510
Now you're satisfied?

349
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,510
Go tell everyone.

350
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,270
Why should I tell everyone?

351
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,050
So you wanna threaten me with that?

352
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,810
Listen, you wish!

353
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,050
I have a company and many bodyguards.

354
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,670
Anyway, if you can't forget my black past,

355
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,470
you'll never leave this place.

356
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,970
I... How could I forget that?

357
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,330
They all say that I'm fat.

358
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,480
From now on, they'll never laugh at me.

359
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,470
Hurry.

360
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,910
Right.

361
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,370
That fat boy in the ad is Xiaodong.

362
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,570
No one knows how much little Xiaodong suffers

363
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,040
after that ad goes out.

364
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,730
He signs the contract with us on only one condition.

365
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,740
To erase the existence of that ad completely.

366
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,650
Lucky that the broadcast range of that ad isn't broad.

367
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,820
Now you can't see the ad on any platform.

368
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,930
But god knows,

369
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,460
in this big world,

370
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,620
there's someone

371
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,310
who can remember him as that fat boy!

372
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,910
You can't forget my black past, right?

373
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,910
What are you gonna do?

374
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,090
I'm gonna help you.

375
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,120
Help you forget it.

376
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,850
Don't worry. As long as this hammer...

377
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,890
This memory-erasing device hits you.

378
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,490
It'll end quick.

379
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,810
You... You said it's a hammer!

380
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,720
Calm down. Calm down.

381
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,250
-Very quick.
-Calm down!

382
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:12,930
Forget the trouble.

383
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,720
Don't...

384
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,970
Forget... Forget all of this.

385
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,100
Forget! Forget!

386
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,970
All departments, attention.

387
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,830
Make sure Plan B works out!

388
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,720
You won't talk or let me go.

389
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,240
What on earth do you want?

390
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,890
I don't know, either.

391
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,810
Why you care about such things so much?

392
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,410
Do you know how much I've suffered

393
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,780
to get rid of my fat?

394
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,520
Up to now, I seldom eat meat.

395
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,070
But do a lot of physical training every day.

396
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,980
Because I know,

397
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,400
my appearance is everything I have.

398
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,170
Once I lose it,

399
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,410
these fans around me

400
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,600
will leave me. No one will stay.

401
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,720
You don't know how hard it is to keep perfect.

402
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,570
You don't know.

403
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,750
Nor you can understand feelings of the one

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,440
being peculiar and mocked by the rest of people.

405
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,720
Well, to be an idol is not what you want?

406
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,780
I don't know.

407
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,400
My original plan is

408
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,110
to make them stop laughing at me.

409
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,510
So you want the whole world to like you?

410
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,870
How is that possible?

411
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,530
Yes, impossible.

412
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,890
One person not into you,

413
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,450
and one thousand people not into you,

414
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,830
what's the difference?

415
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,310
Listen,

416
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,730
there's someone who doesn't like me since childhood.

417
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,730
But, I don't care about him.

418
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,290
So,

419
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,190
you live for yourself, not for any other people.

420
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,190
So live up to it.

421
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,600
And, here's my little secret.

422
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,410
Actually I'm also your fans.

423
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,600
Really?

424
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,090
You like listening to my songs?

425
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,590
No! I mean, that ad!

426
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,980
I really like it!

427
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,780
Every time I practiced back in childhood,

428
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,980
I would swing back and forth like you did in the hula hoop.

429
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Singing and dancing.

430
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,080
Sis Annie, Xue Xiaodong is in the auditorium.

431
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,720
Xiaodong, don't do any stupid things.

432
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
Hurry up!

433
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,050
Xiaodong, don't! Calm down!

434
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,380
Little girl, come and talk with me if you have any problem!

435
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,150
Your friend is a little weird.

436
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,610
I'm leaving first.

437
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,670
Sis Annie, let her go.

438
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,940
Sis Annie.

439
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,340
What's up?

440
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,350
So I really enjoy being an idol.

441
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,550
Liao Danyi.

442
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,760
You're...

443
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm Guan Xinyi, the monitor of Class One.

444
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,640
Also the new president of the Student Union.

445
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,890
Maple Leaf Middle School divides classes by students' scores.

446
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,470
The more scores you get, the better class you have.

447
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,040
So, would you like to join Class One?
