1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,420
There's a bubble in the screen protector.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,220
So annoying!

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,180
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,510
God. My god.

5
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,960
That...that...that...

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,780
How could he use such a phone! The screen is smashed!

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,670
God! What kind of person he is?!

8
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,640
He is so strange.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,790
I'll follow him.

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,410
Followed him here.

11
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,520
This is...

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,020
This restaurant has only one star?

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,380
And he just walked in?

14
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,840
Didn't he check the comments first?

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,750
I'll go and see.

16
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,860
Must be awful.

17
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,240
One star restaurant.

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,290
Don't let anyone see me in here.

19
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,350
So humiliating.

20
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,140
I didn't order.

21
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,030
We only have this kind of noodles.

22
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,740
Why it tastes so delicious?

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,570
- I got soup on my skirt.
- May I ask, how can I get to Rd. Huaxin ?

24
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,620
Rd. Huaxin?

25
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,460
That direction.

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,890
And turn left.

27
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,220
Oh my god!

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
It's all over his shirt!

29
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,760
Cool shirt.

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
She thinks it's cool?

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,770
So awful!

32
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,870
What is he doing?

33
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,130
To correct the character?

34
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,430
Why he is so serious about this?

35
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,870
What the hell is he?!

66
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,930
Okay.

67
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,630
Review your lessons.

68
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,150
How could they be like this?!

69
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,690
How could they be like this?!

70
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,380
Students.

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,890
How could you be like this?!

72
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,970
You're so great!

73
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,480
You're awesome!

74
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,630
This essay is great!

75
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,080
It's so touching, I almost cried.

76
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,590
Yesterday, we learned the poem
Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again.

77
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,740
It was written in 1928.

78
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
That year,

79
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,380
Senior Zhimo revisited that place.

80
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,930
Your question is very good.

81
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,450
Why Senior Zhimo?

82
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,310
To be honest, I really don't want to bring it up.

83
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,260
Your teacher, I graduated from Cambridge 99th session.

84
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,490
Majored in classical literature.

85
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,330
So at some point.

86
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,900
Senior Zhimo and I are schoolmates.

87
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,730
So I called him Shige (Senior Schoolmates).

88
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,390
But, me and him

89
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,750
we're different on one thing.

90
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,870
I got to Cambridge because I made the grade.

91
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,350
But Zhimo.

92
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,320
He just studied in there.

93
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,550
Do you know what does that mean?

94
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,630
He is an exchange student.

95
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,180
Exchange student!

96
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,480
No more of that.

97
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,440
Among all the essays I told you to write yesterday.

98
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,420
Xiong Tiancheng's essay is the best!

99
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,070
Xiong Tiancheng.

100
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,350
Xiong Tiancheng. Are you here?

101
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,790
Xiong Tiancheng.

102
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,680
Super bad luck.

103
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,240
Xiong Tiancheng.

104
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,680
Xiong Tiancheng.

105
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,780
Wu Sir.

106
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,640
Why... Why bother keep calling?

107
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,950
So that is the legendary....

108
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,740
Yes, he is the legendary junk King,

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,340
who is the source of all the pollution of Class Ten.

110
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,590
And no one has ever seen him.

111
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,660
No more Cambridge after Xu Zhimo left.

112
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,640
I step away softly,

113
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,830
just as I came here quietly .

114
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,370
I wave gently ,

115
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,820
sighing goodbye to the western sky.

116
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,810
Cambridge is still there.

117
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,200
The water is still running.

118
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,400
But after the poet left,

119
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,840
The Cambridge is lost.

120
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,560
No one can ever be like him

121
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,690
to read the sensitive Cambridge romantically.

122
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,990
Including every beautiful water grass in Cambridge.

123
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,240
Every silent summer insect.

124
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,000
That is the lost Cambridge.

125
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,460
Wu Sir.

126
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,470
He is one of the talented students in our class.

127
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,490
I believe you see it too.

128
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,500
He is indeed a talent.

129
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,970
But him,

130
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,540
He is always alone.

131
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,910
Doesn't like to talk to people.

132
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,770
In the ancient times, Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang three times.

133
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,240
Today, Wonder Girl Ye will invite him for me.

134
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,220
To be the Chinese Representative.

135
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,050
Exactly!

136
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,430
They're Little Wilde and Little Maugham.

137
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,600
My pet.

138
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,130
Please don't hurt them.

139
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,250
Sorry.

140
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,290
Such a special place in the classroom.

141
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,010
I got the highest score of Chinese examination
back in junior high school.

142
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,560
The only condition to recruit me in this school

143
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,550
is to give me such a space to make a studio.

144
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm quite satisfied.

145
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,960
Studio?

146
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,860
[Xiong Tiancheng Literature Studio]

147
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,560
Xiong Tiancheng,

148
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
I came to you today...

149
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,100
What kind of essay do you want?

150
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,690
No, no, no.

151
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm not here to ask you to write anything.

152
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm here to ask you

153
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,130
to be

154
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,640
our

155
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,690
Chinese representative!

156
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,450
Sorry, I'm very busy.

157
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,290
I have no time for idlers.

158
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,130
Leave.

159
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,100
O-kay.

160
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
So...

161
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,940
You two and Xiong Tiancheng were once
classmates in junior high school?

162
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,790
At that time,

163
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,020
he is the famous Dirty King in our school.

164
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,090
There's one time, during sweep-up.

165
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,700
We found a banana in his drawer

166
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,200
which has been there for a year!

167
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,730
Right. Right.

168
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,550
And you know what.

169
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,630
Let me tell you.

170
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,130
At the beginning day of Grade One in junior high school.

171
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,980
I saw Xiong Tiancheng holding a rice roll.

172
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,330
You know what?

173
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,320
They day we graduated from Grade Three

174
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,340
I found that rice roll in his drawer again!

175
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,420
My god!

176
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,770
How was he and your classmates getting along?

177
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,210
We didn't talk much with him.

178
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,120
Because he was always alone.

179
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,530
And there's one time,

180
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,680
In parents' meeting.

181
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,480
His father scolded him in front of everyone.

182
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,830
That was very harsh!

183
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,340
Since that, he talked even less.

184
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,450
Maybe he thinks it's too embarrassing.

185
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,890
Your essay has no sense of beauty.

186
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,680
Your pen.

187
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,990
I'll help you rewrite it.

188
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,790
Really?

189
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,480
Is that gonna be expensive?

190
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,170
I don't have much.

191
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,560
Don't worry, it's for free.

192
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,020
Okay, thank you.

193
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,590
You can leave now.

194
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,450
You've got all the best part.

195
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,470
So schemed.

196
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,090
Are we really gonna talk about this?

197
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,810
Look at yourself!

198
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,570
The meat is all on your side.

199
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,040
Can't believe it.

200
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,580
My little sister.

201
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,330
She is a good girl.

202
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
But just eats too much.

203
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,710
Look at you. I mean.

204
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,120
What? What? What?

205
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,140
Can't bear it?

206
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,740
So touching.

207
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,210
It's so nice.

208
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,510
Reminding me of the time when you were young.

209
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,010
You were just this little.

210
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,450
And I raised you up.

211
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,680
Do you know why you grow faster than the others?

212
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,730
Let me tell you.

213
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,170
Because you eat a lot. Quite a lot!

214
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,540
What is that smell?

215
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,480
Something smelled a bit off.

216
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,450
I must apologize to you.

217
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,650
I didn't create a perfect environment for your dinner.

218
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,810
My bad.

219
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,850
No, it's not.

220
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,050
I went to talk a weird student.

221
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,490
He is quite messy.

222
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,380
He has a strong smell.

223
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,370
Seems now my clothes has got that smell too.

224
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,280
How messy he is to get that smell?

225
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,360
Haven't showered for years?

226
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,730
Stay away from him.

227
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,680
Don't get some disease.

228
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,890
But although he is dirty, he is very talented.

229
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,370
So I wanna recruit him as one of our class committee.

230
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,830
I have an idea.

231
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,400
What is this?

232
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,560
Xiong Tiancheng?

233
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,270
Shadow stealer?

234
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,700
Look at his name. Look.

235
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,200
As a man who has the same job

236
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
I have to say.

237
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,630
It's not good enough.

238
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,700
He must be a writer online.

239
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,810
A newbie, right?

240
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,490
You knew what was my name back then?

241
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,490
Do you still remember?

242
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,090
A secret man.

243
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,590
Is that good?

244
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,650
A secret....

245
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,050
That's the point.

246
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,050
Why?

247
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,030
Cause it's unpredictable.

248
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,210
When it's unpredictable, they'll be curious.

249
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,110
Right?

250
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,060
You brat.

251
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,940
Always staying at home.

252
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,720
Xiong Tiancheng

253
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,820
Let me see what can you write?

254
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,570
The girl woke up in a wasted place.

255
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,840
There's a tavern in front of her.

256
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,460
The tenants are all some weirdos.

257
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,590
Like crazy scientist.

258
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,650
Gang boss.

259
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,350
Dead waitress.

260
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,050
Strange twins.

261
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,480
A girl who lost her memory.

262
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,030
And a lonely scriptwriter.

263
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,530
All kinds of clients they are seeing in the tavern.

264
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,130
All things begin in here.

265
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,320
And end in here.

266
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,150
This story is called Mozhan.

267
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,290
Do you like it?

268
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,860
Always surfing online.

269
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,260
You brat.

270
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,580
Dad, knock before you enter.

271
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,360
Do I need to knock? I'm your dad.

272
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,260
You don't need privacy in front of me.

273
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,540
Go, get me some beer.

274
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,630
Dad.

275
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,140
I had a fever.

276
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Go now!

277
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,900
Wait a second.

278
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,940
Let me get a coat.

279
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,660
Sick leave?

280
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,070
What shall we do?

281
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,310
Same as usual. Home visit.

282
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,290
Come back, come back.

283
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,890
Although my teaching method is free-ranging,

284
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,270
I can be active sometimes.

285
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,090
How about this.

286
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,410
I'll do the home visit.

287
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,500
You go do your job. go.

288
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,730
Why're you looking at me like this?

289
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,070
-You, being serious.
-Is so weird.

290
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,370
Can't get used to it.

291
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,500
Am I that casual?

292
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,490
I don't care.

293
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,330
Who will fall in love with whom.

294
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,180
I don't care.

295
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,570
- Morning, Wu sir
- Morning.

296
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,330
Wu Sir, please sit.

297
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,940
This time, I also bring you a special gift.

298
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,120
What is that?

299
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,860
This is a novel wrote by Xiong Tiancheng.

300
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,360
I printed it out.

301
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,010
I hope you can read it sometime.

302
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay.

303
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,230
I remember someone said.

304
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,030
In the history, nothing is real except the names.

305
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,230
While in the novel,

306
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,160
Everything is real except the names.

307
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,590
The protagonist in Xiong Tiancheng's novel

308
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,900
has a really bad relationship with his father.

309
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,710
In the novel it's like

310
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,660
it is the same whether his father exists or not.

311
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,290
Mr. Xiong. What I want to say is.

312
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,670
As his parent,

313
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,770
you're the first teacher he has.

314
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,650
Your personality, your habits.

315
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,670
Will play an important role in his life.

316
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,130
Xiong Tiancheng is a very talented boy.

317
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,500
I hope he can grow up healthily.

318
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,840
Mr. Xiong

319
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,930
I hope as his parent,

320
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,020
you can create a good environment for him.

321
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,000
I think you know better than us

322
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,170
about his needs.

323
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
Xiong Tiancheng.

324
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,350
Why do you hate cleaning?

325
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,640
Clean or not.

326
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,490
No one will care.

327
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,130
Then what's the meaning of it?

328
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,040
Why do you like to help others to write essays?

329
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,530
You can't get anything.

330
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,550
I...

331
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,820
I just want to be valued.

332
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,660
By you guys.

333
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,100
By everyone.

334
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,550
I'm done being invisible.

335
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,710
You know what?

336
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,150
The one I care the most

337
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,160
never cares about me.

338
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,120
But I do.

339
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,550
Really?

340
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
Xiong Tiancheng. I'll change you.

341
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,470
So let me make a plan to change you.

342
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,660
Dad.

343
