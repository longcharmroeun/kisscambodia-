Episode 16

31
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,440
Are you guys looking for someone writing for you?

32
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,680
Sorry. I've already got a tight schedule this month.

33
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,680
Please come again next month.

34
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,370
Who are you?

35
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,120
Everyone calls me Language Master.

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,370
As for my full name,

37
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,370
too lazy to tell you.

38
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,370
So arrogant. Kill him!

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,830
It's not because I don't want to tell you my full name.

40
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,220
If I tell you that, it's gonna kill you.

41
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,320
Language Master, ten thousand people walk eastwards.

Of course, you may call me Cheng.

You can not run away this time!

52
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,670

Everything lives in Nature's rules.

55
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,040
Sorry. I can't help if you want my signature.

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,950
My private time. No visitors.

57
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,380
Kill him!

58
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,160
Wait.

59
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,770
I'm a pacifist.

60
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,560
Don't like fight and killing.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
But my fans...

62
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,190
We got visitors.

63
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,640
Gotta give them a remarkable reception.

64
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,600
I'll only use one fist.

65
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,950
It seems that we gotta use fifty percent of our strength.

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,350
It seems that we gotta use all our strength.

67
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,030
Stop. Stop.
[ Biology. History. Geography ]

68
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,480
I was wrong. Stop. Stop.

69
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,740
We were wrong. We were wrong.

70
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,880
Stop it.

71
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,210
I was wrong.

72
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,630
No. Stop it.

73
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,280
Now you know how powerful we are?

74
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,870
You're right, Master.

75
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,040
What you said is much more helpful than that on books.

76
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,080
We've committed grave crimes before.

77
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,350
As you sow, so shall you reap.

78
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,540
The crimes you committed before

79
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,360
can still be atoned in the rest of your life.

80
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,530
In next life, you'll have blessings in return.

81
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,350
Yes. Yes. Master is right. Makes sense.

82
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,730
I quit. I quit. I quit.

83
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,810
My wife is waiting for me downhill.

84
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,440
Gotta go back home to farm.

85
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,440
I shall go back to accompany my mom.

86
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,440
Bye.

87
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,260
Bye.

88
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,970
What the hell is this?

89
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm so mad.

90
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
I mailed my masterpiece to the publishing house.

91
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,150
Really?

92
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,940
Which idiot gave this to me?!

93
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,440
Me. Any problem?

94
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,730
Editor... Editor-in-chief.

95
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,800
I think this piece is so amazing!

96
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,470
My admiration for you goes like the surging river,

97
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,230
running endlessly.

98
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,800
Enough. Enough. Cut the crap.

99
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,540
This is the only one I can think highly of among so many works.

100
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,110
Review it quick. Then come back to me.

101
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,730
I'll tell you the content for our next issue.

102
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,760
Forget it. Must have some relations with her.

103
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,490
I better control myself and finish this as soon as possible.

104
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,270
Shen Luoluo, the Fortune-teller,

105
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,680
introduces everyone to this maiden.

106
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,000
Thus everyone knows,

107
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,010
this maiden comes from the spicy strip tribe.

108
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,930
And she's the chief's daughter.

109
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,770
-Lazio·July.
-I see.

110
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,520
I see.

111
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,590
The evil boss Rubbish · Liao hates junk food like spicy strips.

112
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,720
So he's imprisoned all the people of her tribe.

113
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,760
And every day, he makes them eat insipid green food

114
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,050
free of addictive and swill-cooked oil.

115
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,860
Makes every body live in a miserable hell.

116
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,690
So hateful!

117
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,360
They can't do that to you guys.

118
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,640
-Don't worry...
-But under the help of a mysterious man,

119
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,060
Lazio · July managed to escape from there.

120
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,900
But they found her trace all the way to here.

121
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,120
So it's a village.

122
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
-But this maiden Lazio · July...
-Shut up! My turn to speak!

123
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm sorry.

124
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,030
It's okay. Yezi is here. I'll save everyone.

125
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,170
Don't worry.

126
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,140
Village Head, I have something to report.

127
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,970
Shoot.

128
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,400
The first thing is,

129
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,110
those remorseful soldiers told me just now,

130
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,370
because of Lazio · July's escape,

131
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,300
the evil boss feels being humiliated.

132
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,260
When they were about to surrender and packed up,

133
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,490
they sent a resignation letter to him by the way.

134
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,770
So the evil boss might come here in three days

135
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,360
by the address on the letter.

136
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,440
The second thing is,

137
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,320
when I bumped into Miss Lazio·July,

138
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,800
I had a prediction.

139
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,690
Although it's very vague,

140
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,960
it is in favor of us.

141
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,670
What should we do, then?

142
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,430
The evil boss will attack us in three days.

143
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,610
Sorry.

144
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,500
I make you suffer this.

145
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,480
Never mind. We can fight with them!

146
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,430
But didn't we lose to them miserably six years ago?

147
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,770
But it's been six years now.

148
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,590
So everyone has become stronger after six years?

149
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,970
Not at all!

150
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,570
And we haven't practiced since then.

151
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,410
I feel we've become much weaker.

152
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,410
Never mind! We have morale!

153
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,650
Yes! We have morale!

154
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,980
Do you still want to wait?

155
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,940
No!

156
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,260
Do you still want to hide?

157
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,390
No!

158
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,720
Then we shall liberalize those being oppressed!

159
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,850
Okay!

160
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,160
Listen to my order!

161
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,680
Meal time!

162
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,820
Okay!

163
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,720
Eat this. Eat this.

164
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,410
Have more. Have more.

165
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,450
Yes, give some to her.

166
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,610
Yezi, that, that evil boss Liao is gonna attack us.

167
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,600
Is it appropriate for us just to eat like this?

168
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,800
Everyone, remember to do training.

169
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,000
Your unique skill.

170
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
Your unique skill must be mastered.

171
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,570
No problem.

172
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,420
Don't worry.

173
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,280
Go on.

174
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,890
Have some vegetables.

175
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,130
I think this sauce is very good.

176
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,830
That evil boss Liao, why is he so bad?

177
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,760
Why does he have to destroy our Fantasy Village?

178
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,550
So delicious.

179
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,710
Come here.

180
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,190
Miss July, you might not know this.

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,190
In fact, Rubbish?Liao is a member of our Fantasy Village.

182
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,730
Let me help you.

183
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,510
No, to be exact,

184
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,490
he and wonder girl Ye created this village with their own hands.

185
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,360
But later, he betrayed this place.

186
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,660
And claimed that he's gonna attack us.

187
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,350
And destroy this place.

188
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,670
Since then, wonder girl Ye started a long struggle against him.

189
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,410
But if we're really gonna fight,

190
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,250
Yezi must feel very sad.

191
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,710
In the past,

192
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,330
they're very, very close friends.

193
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,500
We live a happy life every day.

194
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,490
Hi.

195
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,270
They're our inventors here.

196
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,920
They're good at inventing things.

197
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,670
Twin Star Brothers.

198
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,280
This is the latest immortal water developed by us.

199
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,140
Drink it and your face will stay beautiful.

200
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,190
Want a try?

201
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,740
I'm beautiful enough.

202
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,040
Superstar · Xiaodong.

203
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,250
Today he's in charge of our dinner.

204
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:28,710
Hi.

205
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,480
Thank you.

206
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,960
Come here, Lazio.

207
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,880
This is the prophet in our Fantasy Village.

208
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,640
Fortune-teller · Wei.

209
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,270
Hi, would you like a prediction?

210
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,390
Animal sign, horoscope, marriage, very accurate.

211
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,450
Okay.

212
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,100
Give me your right hand.

213
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,900
Relationships.

214
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,380
Really?

215
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,270
What about me?

216
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,810
Let me see.

217
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,500
A lonely star.

218
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,220
What... What does that mean?

219
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,570
Pretty good. Pretty good.

220
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
To be exact.

221
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,530
It's also about relationships. Relationships.

222
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,400
Really?

223
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,640
We're the same.

224
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,300
We'll have relationships together.

225
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,220
Yes. We'll have relationships together.

226
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,850
What did I tell you? You can only eat it after it falls on the floor!

227
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,470
Don't you know the rules?

228
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,880
Wonder girl Ye, they are...

229
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,010
Them? They're beggars tramping to here.

230
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,620
One is Henchman · He.

231
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,080
The other is Stupid · Guan.

232
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,830
They do nothing but ask for food here.

233
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,610
Can't get rid of them.

234
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,550
Go away! Go. Go. Go.

235
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,700
Look, this is the fortune-teller stone.

236
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,910
As long as you put your hands on it,

237
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,390
clear your mind,

238
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,930
it can sense your talent level and attribute.

239
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,940
Come, let me try it.

240
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,380
So bright. She must be exceptionally talented.

241
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,980
But what attribute does the azure mean?

242
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,070
I've never seen this color.

243
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,540
Yes. What does azure mean?

244
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,610
Careful.

245
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,980
Azure means waiting for the rain.

246
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,140
And we're waiting for you.

247
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,300
So I think she's null attribute.

248
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,000
Null attribute?

249
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,360
For example.

250
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,520
My color is crimson. So my attribute is fire.

251
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,810
Language Master · Tiancheng's attribute is earth.

252
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,730
Monitor Yezi's attribute is water.

253
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,680
Xiaodong's is gold.

254
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,330
So we five have occupied

255
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,600
all attributes of the five elements.

256
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,640
So I think she's null attribute.

257
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,020
So I must be very awesome?

258
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,520
Great! I can help you now!

259
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,110
Well, what kind of magical ability shall I cultivate?

260
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,900
Null attribute is not suitable for any magic arts.

261
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,210
So you can't help us at all.

262
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,270
But you said I'm very awesome!

263
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,470
Because its color is pure and uncontaminated.

264
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,810
So it's very awesome!

265
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
Well, on which aspect the awesomeness lies?

266
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,790
It's my first time to see such a useless girl like you.

267
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
So you're highly worthy of appreciation and collection.

268
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,320
Why can't I master any skills?

269
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,510
If only I could master one single skill!

270
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,670
For example, Yezi,

271
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,610
how good it is if I can fly as you do!

272
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,850
Okay. It's very easy.

273
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,870
After eight or nine years learning, you can fly as well.

274
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,110
How is that possible? I have no wings.

275
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,770
Why do you have to have wings to fly?

276
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,450
I can fly because I use Money King art.

277
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,850
But this...

278
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,500
This...

279
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,790
Just an ornament. Want to wear it?

280
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,880
It's detachable?

281
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,900
Superstar · Xiaodong.

282
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,960
You alone here. Don't you feel very lonely every day?

283
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,070
What's called loneliness?

284
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,170
What's called solitude?

285
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,930
You can see me smiling every day.

286
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,500
But you can't see my helplessness,

287
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,910
my trouble,

288
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,590
my confusion.

289
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,410
How much I hope I can be like you guys!

290
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,020
To breathe air in the Nature.

291
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,210
To run on the beach.

292
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,500
Collect shells in the sea breeze.

293
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,750
But I can't get out of here.

294
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,970
I'm locked up in here like this every day.

295
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,820
Breathing my own breath.

296
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,210
Being sad at my own sadness.

297
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,980
Xiaodong...

298
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,500
Never mind. I've been used to this.

299
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,100
Xiaodong!

300
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,370
Meal time!

301
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,640
Okay. What are we gonna eat today?

302
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,400
Many your favorites.

303
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,790
It seems that there's hot-pot.

304
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,770
No. I want to eat pizza.

305
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,600
Why pizza? Hurry up.

306
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,270
The evil boss is about to arrive.

307
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,940
Fortune-teller · Wei, I need you to predict.

308
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,640
I need to know when they'll arrive.

309
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,130
More importantly, I need to know

310
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,640
how many people will come with them.

311
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,790
Yes, madam.

312
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,190
Superstar · Xiaodong,

313
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,700
I need you to arrange your fans to reach every corner.

314
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,510
I need to know in which direction they're gonna approach us.

315
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,210
But that will make me lose fans.

316
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,110
It's okay. I'll make up for the number through buying.

317
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,370
My fans are real people.

318
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,380
Doesn't matter.

319
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,750
Twin Star Brothers.

320
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,660
I need you to arrange for plenty of props.

321
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,660
To reduce their number as soon as possible.

322
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,960
No problem.

323
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,260
Power · Yao.

324
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,370
I need you to kill as possible as you can.

325
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,450
Okay.

326
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,430
Dark · Yuan and Cheng.

327
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,080
You'll take charge of shooting.

328
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,680
Okay.

329
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,910
And, the most important task.

330
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,690
Is yours.

331
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,860
Henchman · He and Stupid · Guan.

332
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,220
Tonight, you must get the needle mushrooms

333
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,160
and hot-pot condiment done. Thanks.

334
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
What about me? What about me?

335
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,300
Just stay behind me.

336
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,500
I'll protect you.

337
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,150
Won't do anything else?

338
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,080
Don't worry. You'll enter the stage sooner or later.

339
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,430
Okay. Everyone, get ready.

340
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,080
Okay! Okay!

341
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,770
Let's go!

342
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,720
Let's go!

343
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,020
Miss Xinyi.

344
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,970
Where are they?

345
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,310
All asleep.

346
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,340
Okay.

347
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,020
It's time to reveal our true identity.

348
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,020
Cast the spell.

349
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,200
Miss Xinyi, your face is stained.

350
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,980
Really?

351
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,970
Okay now?

352
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,630
Here. Here. Here.

353
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,600
My king, you come here alone.

354
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,320
It's dangerous.

355
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,890
My king, rest easy.

356
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,720
Everything is going smoothly.

357
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:14,410
[ Time flies. The duel day comes soon. ]

358
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,600
You're struggling in vain.

359
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,530
When we sneaked in here,

360
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,250
we poisoned every one of them.

361
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,500
Here.

362
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,850
More for you. More for you.

363
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,640
Okay. Okay.

364
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,770
I think this coffee must be good.

365
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,440
Where are you from, beggar?

366
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,970
Put it down.

367
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,070
Get our of here. Get out.

368
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,330
What are you doing?

369
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,330
So annoying! Why come here?

370
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,940
Put it down!

371
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,690
Unbelievable.

372
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,700
Gotta close the door next time.

373
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,520
What are you doing here?

374
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,990
Well, Master Xiong.

375
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,560
I have something to ask you.

376
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,950
What's that?

377
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,710
What book are you reading lately?

378
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,370
I've been reading many books lately.

379
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,360
What, you're interested into books?

380
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,370
If you want me to recommend some books to you,

381
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,370
that must be the books written by myself. Here.

382
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,630
Don't! Wait!

383
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,710
What's your book's name?

384
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,210
It's coming soon.

385
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,850
How could you hide those little tricks from me?

386
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,280
In fact, on the first day you came here,

387
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,270
I managed to know that you're spies.

388
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,220
But I faked being fooled by you.

389
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,510
To enjoy the game.

390
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,880
In fact, every time after you put poison,

391
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,000
I would put antidote as well.

392
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,960
So, none of us gets poisoned.

393
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,410
Yezi, let's fight!

394
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,880
Kill them!

395
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,040
And me!

396
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,130
Gosh.

397
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,120
My god.

398
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,490
Wait.

399
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,110
No. This feeling...

400
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,390
I...

401
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,650
No way. I've put antidote.

402
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,500
This doesn't feel like being poisoned.

403
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,840
Is it... Is it because...

404
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,930
Here. Let me recommend you

405
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,160
this sacred food of our Lazio tribe.

406
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,160
Feel it.

407
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,540
Close your eyes. Feel its flavor slowly.

408
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,860
Isn't it bouncy and spicy?

409
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,820
As if there are angels flying around you.

410
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,040
It is indeed a connotative food.

411
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,550
Isn't it delicious?

412
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,920
Have more.

413
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,120
Is it because those spicy strips?

414
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,690
Spicy strips?

415
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,780
Yezi, you're dead today!

416
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,210
Miss Xinyi, no...

417
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,800
It seems that we also...

418
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,840
Have a taste.

419
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,160
This is our Lazio tribe's specialty.

420
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,860
So delicious.

421
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,870
Am I right? Isn't it delicious?

422
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,090
We also ate spicy strips!

423
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,350
Now, only you and me left.

424
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,760
Give up. Before it's too late.

425
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,710
You're asking for this!

426
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,010
Stop!

427
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,680
Yezi!

428
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,720
The duel between Yezi and the evil boss Liao

429
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,560
lasts three days and three nights.

430
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,960
This is a duel that startles the world and makes gods cry.

431
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,300
Mountains and rivers are shocked.

432
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,300
And the ground gets moved.

433
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,670
Finally, the critical moment comes.

434
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,440
Give up. You're running out of strength.

435
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,440
You and your pals.

436
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,060
And the entire Fantasy Village.

437
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,530
Let me destroy it with my own hands!

438
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,480
Yezi, hang in there!

439
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,180
Useless thing, you won't make any different.

440
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,210
I'm useless.

441
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,210
I'm not good at anything.

442
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,500
I only bring trouble to everyone.

443
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,990
But as long as I can do a little help,

444
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,530
I'll contribute all my strength to this!

445
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,850
Don't worry. You're not fighting alone.

446
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,760
I'm here.

447
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,830
And me!

448
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,030
You guys are alright?

449
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,410
Just some spicy strips.

450
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,350
Already digested.

451
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,230
See? Liao Danyi.

452
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,430
You can never beat me.

453
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,970
Because you're always alone.

454
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,260
But I have my friends!

455
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,410
I have the entire world!

456
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,380
Impossible.

457
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,420
Who are you?

458
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,920
Do you remember your name?

459
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,960
And where you come from?

460
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,410
It's okay.

461
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,410
From now on,

462
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,410
you'll live with us.

463
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,980
Bear in mind your new name.

464
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,410
Baby · Liao.

465
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,080
Baby · Liao?

466
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,330
Come with me.

467
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,120
Welcome, Baby· Liao.

468
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,320
Welcome, Baby · Liao.

469
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,530
Welcome. Welcome.

470
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,920
Hi, everyone. I'm Baby · Liao.

471
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,010
I'm Huang Yi.

472
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,910
I'm Huang Nan.

473
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm Lazio·July.

474
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm Fortune-teller · Wei.

475
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,780
I'm Language Master · Cheng.

476
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,050
I'm Dark · Yuan.

477
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,070
Welcome, Baby · Liao.

478
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,710
Baby · Liao.

479
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,580
Welcome. Welcome.

480
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,210
Welcome to join this big family!

481
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,290
Let's eat hot-pot together.

482
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,290
Superstar · Xiaodong?

483
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,290
Where were you just now?

484
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,350
I saw everyone go to help you.

485
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,560
Felt that my help was unnecessary.

486
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
So I went to get the hot-pot condiment ready.

487
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,280
Come on, let's eat hot-pot together!

488
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,560
Eat hot-pot together!

489
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,230
Come on!

490
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,640
Hot-pot!

491
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,460
You sit here. I'll sit there.

492
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,710
In this way,

493
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,380
Fantasy Village embraces the long-lost peace.

494
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,870
The evil boss Liao loses his memory.

495
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,870
Now becomes Baby · Liao.

496
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,740
And lives happily with everyone else.

497
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,370
Eat it. It's very delicious.

498
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,820
Editor-in-chief, I've read this cartoon.

499
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,190
Rich in content.

500
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,540
Novel in theme.

501
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,860
So we'll issue this cartoon.

502
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,860
Go contact the author.

503
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,860
By the way, ask her,

504
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,840
has she ever thought to make The Big Boss into a series?

505
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,290
The Big Boss?

506
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,130
But... But this cartoon that I've read...

507
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,810
This one?

508
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,010
This one, I only read one page.

509
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,840
I put it on your desk to remind you,

510
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:11,270
in the future, keep this kind of work out of my vision.

511
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,570
The painting style, is really unbearable.

512
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,020
Okay.

513
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,930
Yezi, lunch is ready.

514
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,710
Stop working.

515
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,880
Let's have lunch downstairs.

516
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,890
Okay. In a minute.

517
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,850
Well, have you received my delivery?

518
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,850
What delivery?

519
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,050
Any call looking for me?

520
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,130
Well.

521
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,350
How could they call me looking for you?

522
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,250
Fine.

523
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,420
Then I shall wait here for my delivery.

524
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,190
Really?

525
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,210
I believe they'll contact me soon after they see that work.

526
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,380
Then I'll make a big money.

527
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,700
I'll take you to eat hot-pot all over the world.

528
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,340
Okay. Okay.

529
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,910
I'm already moved since you can think that way and say that.

530
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,660
So great. So great.

531
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,030
Yezi, seize the time to draw more.

532
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,660
Go downstairs after you're done.

533
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,230
Hurry. I'll wait for you.

534
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,040
When can we walk out of the forest?

535
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,980
Why I feel that we're back to here again?

536
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,860
I don't think so.

537
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,880
Master Stupid.

538
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
We'll walk out of the forest soon.

539
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm so mad!

540
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,280
Unbelievable, those guys.

541
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,710
One day,

542
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,470
I'll help the evil boss restore his memory.

543
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,890
And kill them all.

544
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,920
So mad!

545
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,650
-So mad!
-Miss Xinyi, ease your anger.

546
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,100
Your inner injury is not recovered yet.

547
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,540
-Ease your anger...
-Speaking of that...

548
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,130
Gosh! Wait for me. Wait for me.

549
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,610
So mad!

550
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,420
Ye Muxi, what are you drawing?

551
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,550
A story that a hero defeats an evil boss.

552
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,140
Can I draw with you?

553
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,210
Okay.

554
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,940
Let's draw this story together.

555
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,780
And tell it to all kids.

556
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,610
what are you drawing? Go back to study!

557
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,490
Don't let me see you drawing any more!

558
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,040
Why is Liao Danyi still not here?

559
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,800
Well, I'll draw it by myself.

560
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,010
What shall I call the place where the heroes live?

561
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,180
Fantasy Village!
