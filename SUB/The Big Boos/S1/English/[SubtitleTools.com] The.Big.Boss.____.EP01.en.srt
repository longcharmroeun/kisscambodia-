1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,770
Gosh, how dare you turn on this?

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,520
Very brave.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,850
Since it's on,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,390
gotta play something.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,570
Right?

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,490
So,

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,590
what do you want to see?

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:13,870
Comedy?

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,800
Costume?

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,340
Singing and dancing?

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,660
Fantasy?

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,910
Action movie?

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,370
Or, you just want to see something

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,070
while making instant noodles?

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,600
We can give you everything that you want.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,030
Impossible is nothing.

17
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,750
But, if you want to see some soup drama,

18
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,280
Marry Sue,

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,870
or,

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,860
turn this off.

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,430
Because no matter how you define this,

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,650
this is not a...

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,240
Love story.

24
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,950
Class begins.

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,890
Stand up.

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,140
Hi, boys and girls.

27
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,110
Hi, teacher.

28
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,950
Sit.

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,630

34
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,950
# Running, with schoolbag on our back #

35
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,140
# Sunlight, goes into our coat #

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,470
# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,230
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,540
# Waiting, the signal for running #

39
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,400
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,910
# After class, we laugh and sing #

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,980
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

42
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,310
# On the way to the future #

43
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,250
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

44
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,610
# Forever young heartbeats #

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,600

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
# Dream big, break the limits #

Episode 01

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,180
MC Nuggets chicken wings!

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,280
White crane spreads wings!

61
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,800
Dodge in front, Huskie behind!

62
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,540
Dragon by left, Tiger right!

63
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,590
Tomato, potato, can I take three with one yuan to my home?

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,280
Can't do it any more.

65
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,330
Wonder girl, hungry?

66
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,900
Yes!

67
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,660
Eat!

68
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,060
little sister, in a blink of eyes,

69
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
you've been such a big girl.

70
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,030
Thinking of this,

71
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,030
the feeling I have is so complicated!

72
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,670
Today is your first day to school.

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,460
I must see you off in a handsome way!

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,650
Make you dignified!

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,350
In future, whether you're in high school or college,

76
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,600
or postgraduate,

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,390
you'll always be my little sister!

78
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,520
Brother, I want radish!

79
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,910
Okay!

80
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,540
Brother, no need to see me off.

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,630
Are you kidding?

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,800
Today is my sweet Yezi's first day in school.

83
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,140
As your big brother,

84
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,890
I must send you there handsomely!

85
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,620
Don't you have scripts to finish?

86
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,780
Scripts?

87
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,930
Is it more important than my sweet Yezi?

88
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,930
Out of inspiration?

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,020
Yes.

90
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,520
Okay.

91
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,610
Let's go.

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,430
Today is a day worth remembering.

93
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,720
And going down in history.

94
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,550
And...

95
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,180
Killing spirit.

96
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,340
Stop. Stop, brother.

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,710
What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,710
You scared me.

99
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,400
This guy is my childhood sweet...

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,830
No, my arch enemy.

101
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,400
Lad Danyi!

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,870
Liao Danyi.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
Ever since I could remember,

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,590
he's been around me.

105
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,590
Whether in kindergarten,

106
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,350
primary school, or secondary school,

107
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,660
this guy has been the monitor of my class.

108
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,640
Always goes against me.

109
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,730
He's a nightmare of my childhood.

110
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,540
Detritus in my shoes.

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,500
A plague that keeps me miserable.

112
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,650
Very unlucky.

113
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,910
The monitor stuff is most annoying.

114
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,870
You can't!

115
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,050
Study hard!

116
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,380
Lad Danyi.
No!

117
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,680
Lad Danyi,

118
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,030
this clothes makes you look really handsome!

119
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,850
Your first day to school?

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,010
What a coincidence! My sweet Yezi's first day to school, too.

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,710
What's wrong?

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
Bow tie loose.

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,160
Socks not balanced.

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,400
Shoelaces too loose.

125
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,780
I didn't notice these because we went out in a rush.

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,110
Sweet Yezi.

127
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,450
Brother Ye, she can do it.

128
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,050
Or she'll never learn it.

129
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,760
It's okay. My sweet Yezi is good in every way.

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,380
But sometimes she's a little careless.

131
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,250
The new semester just begins.

132
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,250
You'll leave a bad impression!

133
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,820
You think I'm not happy?

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,820
Because you've annoyed me?

135
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,120
Not at all.

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,870
Because as of today,

137
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,870
nine-year compulsory education ends.

138
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,300
As of today, I'm out of your control.

139
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,970
As of today, we're not in the same class.

140
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,960
Today, nothing is gonna ruin my good mood.

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
Brother, go to school.

142
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,600
Wait, bow tie.

143
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,660
Go.

144
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,000
Lad Danyi, see you later.

145
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,250
Wait for me.

146
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,320
Turn. Turn. Turn.

147
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,120
Why are you following me so closely?

148
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,120
Sticky candy?

149
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,690
At the next turning, go to another direction.

150
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,530
Turn! Turn!

151
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,530
Turn!

152
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,130
Brother, stop!

153
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,750
Stop. Stop. Stop.

154
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,230
Liao Danyi, stop!

155
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,060
What... What's wrong?

156
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,480
I appreciate your kindness.

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,390
But you can't see me off to the end.

158
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,480
Back to your own way.

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm on my way to school.

160
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,990
I'm on my way to school as well.

161
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,990
Miss Xinyi, I've been waiting for a long time.

162
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,630
You also make it into Class One?

163
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,480
Must be hard for you.

164
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,020
To follow you, miss Xinyi,

165
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,450
It's worth it.

166
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,760
Today I'm the first one to get here.

167
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
I've chosen a best seat for you.

168
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,850
The fourth line by the window.

169
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,060
The third line from the front.

170
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,460
Neither too far nor too close to the blackboard.

171
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,760
Best day-lighting.

172
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Ten o'clock a.m. Forty-five degrees of sunlight

slashes into the classroom to silhouette your perfect profile.

174
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,070
Besides, I've dealt with the one who sat in this seat.

175
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,490
I've closeted myself with all our classmates.

176
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,140
They all agree that you're the best candidate for our monitor.

177
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,380
That's unnecessary.

178
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,590
Isn't it a matter of course for me to the monitor?

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,390
Yes.

180
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,410
Get off, Yezi.

181
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,750
What are you watching? Stop it.

182
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,110
Stop it.

183
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,250
Listen,

184
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,290
Lad Danyi has been gone a few blocks before.

185
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,670
It's your first day to school. Do look beautiful.

186
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,280
Sister, I must stop here.

187
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,790
Your first day to school.

188
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,790
Hope everything goes well for you!

189
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,220
Brother, I'm going!

190
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,980
Okay. Sister, be careful.

191
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,620
My sister is really grown up.

192
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,130
So is her strength.

193
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,280
[ Maple Leaf Middle School ]

194
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,250
Everything is normal. Clear.

195
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,110
Copy.

196
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,210
Copy.

197
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,510
You little troublemakers.

198
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,610
Do you know what gives you this punishment?

199
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,730
Cheating in the exam!

200
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,480
Being late!

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,260
Leaving early!

202
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,100
Cutting school!

203
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,150
Puppy love!

204
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,070
Smoking!

205
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,880
Leaving early!

206
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,640
Xue Xiaodong! Xue Xiaodong!

207
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,380
Hey, girls.

208
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,770
Don't push. Don't push.

209
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,500
Behave yourselves, girls.

210
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on.

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,910
Bro, don't you feel a little dizzy?

212
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,540
Yes, all of a sudden.

213
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,290
Very quietly I take my leave.

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,360
as quietly as I came here;

215
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,140
Quietly I wave good-bye, to the rosy clouds in the western sky.

216
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,650
Liangchen, you're in a good state today.

217
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,830
You, too, Meijing, in a good state, too.

218
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,620
You saying that will make me shy.

219
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,850
It won't. Because I was telling the truth.

220
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,140
If you have a problem with me, spit it out!

221
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,470
I can handle it!

222
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,040
Why are you running away?

223
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,730
Where are the chicken drumsticks you bought?

224
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,730
Excuse me, senior. I'll go buy right now.

225
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,380
And cokes. Hurry.

226
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,210
The sun enters into Aries, Mercury retrogrades.

227
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,030
Disaster!

228
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,410
Miss Xinyi, basketball court is dangerous.

229
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,600
Leave this place now.

230
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,800
Can't even hold the ball, how could you play it?

231
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,450
This wall is so white.

232
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,960
No! I gotta control myself.

233
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,910
Right here.

234
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,880
Yes. Great.

235
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,220
Three years of high school life is gonna take place in here.

236
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,590
Hi, can you tell me where's Class Ten, Grade Ten?

237
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,530
This is the secondary high school.

238
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,150
Go across this playground, climb over the stairs

239
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,370
to the end. Go right ahead.

240
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,530
And the building in the deepest corner is the high school.

241
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,250
Okay.

242
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,460
Maple Leaf Middle School decides classes by scores.

243
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,080
Even if Liao Danyi is in this school,

244
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,480
he won't be in the same class with me,

245
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,240
unless he skipped an exam for one of the courses.

246
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,180
My happy, untrammeled, free

247
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,650
campus life without Liao Danyi

248
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,810
begins now!

249
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,890
What's wrong with your high school entrance exam?

250
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,580
Answering questions with your eyes closed?

251
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,720
Listening to videos with your ears stuffed?

252
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,120
How could you end up in my class?

253
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,830
One course missed.

254
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,830
What did you say?

255
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,160
Had a fever before exam. One course missed.

256
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,910
You really skipped an exam?

257
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,050
My word is so efficacious!

258
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,260
But this morning, you didn't wear school uniform.

259
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,350
I had a fever on the uniform day.

260
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,160
I picked up this uniform today.

261
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,760
Had a fever again and again. Why didn't it kill you?

262
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,760
Anyway, the last period of my youth,

263
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,760
the most wonderful three years,

264
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,290
can't be ruined by you.

265
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,290
Liao Danyi.

266
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,740
Hi, everyone. I'm your head teacher, Wu Heng.

267
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,610
We'll spend three years together from now on.

268
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,460
No more details about me.

269
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,540
'Cause in future, you'll get to know me thoroughly.

270
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,850
Now, everyone, please introduce yourself.

271
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,560
Hello, everyone, I'm Shen Wei.

272
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,570
I love horoscope and fortune-telling.
Hello, everyone, I'm Shen Wei.

273
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,010
I love horoscope and fortune-telling.

274
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,010
Constellation and Tarot cards.

275
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,010
I'm Yuan Ke'er.

276
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,680
My hobby is painting.

277
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,330
I love everything that is beautiful.

278
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,630
Hi, everyone. I'm Cheng Ling.

279
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Nice to meet you guys.

280
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,060
Hope we can be friends.

281
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,210
Li Yao!

282
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,080
Hi, everyone, I'm Gao Fei.

283
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,080
My hobby is video games.

284
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,170
Hope we can be good friends.

285
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,510
Half of the first episode.

286
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,750
We're still not on camera yet.

287
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,930
You think it's good?

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,990
Such self-introductions sucks!

289
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't you want something cooler?!

290
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Want three-color dried fruit?

291
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,420
Gives you a special feeling in this special night.

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,880
Original price is three yuan. Now, only two yuan.

293
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,850
Are you lonely?

294
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,370
If you are, let this talking minion talk with you!

295
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,770
It's time to protect our country.

296
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,990
How about a gun?

297
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,570
To show your masculine side!

298
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,130
And regain your manhood!

299
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,290
Wanna be a hero?

300
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,110
Wanna get back your childhood?

301
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,160
Here's a chance.

302
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,230
For you to transform!

303
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,510
Do buy a soccer to build up your body.

304
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,450
For our country's sake, make yourself stronger.

305
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,270
So, if you're in any difficulty,

306
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,590
remember to contact us at any time.

307
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm Huang Nan.

308
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,060
I'm Huang Yi.

309
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,890
This is Zhi'nan Xingyi Corporation Limited!
(To know is difficult, but to do is easy)

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,930
Hi, everyone. I'm Liao Danyi.

311
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,050
I hope I can work with you guys

312
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,050
to finish the three-year study orderly.

313
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,760
Hereby I request,

314
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,230
to work as monitor of our class.

315
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,600
Because ever since the primary school,

316
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,100
over the past nine years,

317
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,330
I've been serving as the monitor.

318
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,830
So I have enough self-confidence and faith

319
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,330
to completely live up to this position.

320
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,090
Don't make him our monitor.

321
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm Ye Muxi.

322
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,870
Very well.

323
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,820
Everyone's self-introduction is very brilliant.

324
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,650
Now, let's enter into another session.

325
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,090
Class Committee election.

326
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,930
In this session,

327
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,640
I gotta make it clear to you guys.

328
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,530
Every committee member of Class Ten

329
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,320
should be elected by classmates through democratic election.

330
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,030
Just now, Liao Danyi recommended himself

331
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,240
as the monitor. Very good.

332
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,110
That means he's responsible and reliable.

333
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,410
So I hope you guys can follow his example.

334
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,380
And sign up for the election actively.

335
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,080
Well, let me see which one of you guys

336
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,080
also want to be the monitor?

337
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,610
What should I do?

338
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,890
Who can give me some good idea right now?

339
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,150
Now the entire world knows

340
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,870
that bastard Liao Danyi wants to be the monitor!

341
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,960
Who? Who can stop him? Stand out!

342
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,210
You're...

343
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,450
You guys are...

344
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,860
I'm Mr. Wolong.

345
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,050
You created me when you're seven.

346
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm Sima Yi.

347
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,800
You created me three minutes after you

348
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,380
made this greenish stuff.

349
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,600
Sima Yi, Mr. Dinosaur...

350
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,730
Please call me Mr. Wolong.

351
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,860
That's my last dignity.

352
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,460
The class I'm in now is very chaotic.

353
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,800
But Liao Danyi wants to fight against me

354
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,290
for the monitor position.

355
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,350
But if he's the monitor,

356
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,350
this class will be totally over.

357
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,320
Currently, the world is divided with bad guys in the way.

358
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,940
This is really a very critical and fatal moment.

359
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,040
Wonder girl, why don't you rise in revolt for the people?

360
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,770
And replace him?

361
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,380
Replace him?

362
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,610
Replace him?!

363
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,060
Right.

364
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,090
Now let me announce,

365
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,090
monitor of Class Ten is...

366
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,090
Wait!

367
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,550
I, Ye Muxi, want to join the monitor election!

368
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,100
Ye Muxi? Okay.

369
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,630
Well, Liao Danyi, Ye Muxi.

370
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,030
Get your speech ready back home.

371
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,480
Tomorrow, see you both in the election site.

372
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,760
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

373
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,130
What are you doing?

374
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,890
Stopping you.

375
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,080
So early.

376
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,080
Yes, Miss Late.

377
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,320
A new bag?

378
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,670
What?

379
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,770
Let me have a look.

380
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,290
Come on, relax.

381
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,510
Relax.

382
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,870
That's right.

383
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,800
Let me see.

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,490
It's new.

385
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,530
I'll be earlier than you this time!

386
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,370
School is...

387
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,630
This way.

388
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,620
I didn't expect this.

389
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,880
Although you were riding in the wrong direction,

390
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,600
yet my car hit your...

391
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,550
Bike.

392
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,130
So I should compensate you and apologize to you.

393
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,050
Apologize.

394
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,810
Sorry.

395
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,320
I have no time taking you to the hospital.

396
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
Or checking your injury.

397
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,090
I'm in a hurry to school.

398
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,360
Me, too!

399
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
So we're alumnae.

400
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,660
But, why did you ride in this direction?

401
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,130
School is that way.

402
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,760
School is that way.

403
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,790
My mistake.

404
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,020
Is this enough?

405
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,250
Not enough.

406
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,670
How about this?

407
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,350
Gimme.

408
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,210
I want to do this thing for a long time.

409
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,480
Who cares about your money?!

410
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,610
What are you doing?

411
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,100
Boys and girls,

412
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,750
today is our monitor election day.

413
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,240
Candidates, please get your speech ready.

414
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
We'll start the election in ten minutes.

415
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,580
Hi, everyone, I'm Liao Danyi.

416
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,520
I want to join the monitor election.

417
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,340
So I've made a questionnaire.

418
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,340
Hope you guys can fill in it.

419
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,200
So, after I get the results,

420
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,400
I can accomplish my job more specifically.

421
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,960
Now I'm gonna start my election speech.

422
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,510
I don't know how you guys think about this monitor position.

423
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,450
First of all, I think, the monitor

424
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,810
should serve everyone in a better way.

425
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,130
And make considerate plans according to everyone's

426
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,810
academic performance.

427
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,170
No. I can't keep running in this way.

428
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,720
I must be late.

429
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,040
Girl, need help?

430
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,420
When you're in need,

431
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,440
Zhinan Xingyi is always around.

432
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,440
Any bike?

433
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,590
Kidding.

434
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,890
How could we have such an outdated stuff?

435
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,300
Then what?

436
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,020
Wait, girl.

437
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,210
Calm down.

438
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,310
Let's go!

439
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,880
I won't be late again!

440
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,990
That's all.

441
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,570
Thank you.

442
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,880
Now, welcome the next candidate.

443
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,770
The next candidate is still not here.

444
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,030
So we don't need to wait for her, right?

445
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,610
Last question,

446
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,780
any other classmates wants to the monitor?

447
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,990
If no,

448
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,170
let's officially appoint Liao Danyi as our...

449
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,670
Wait! Wait!

450
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,610
Mr. Wu, wait.

451
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,750
We have another candidate.

452
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,750
The candidate is her!

453
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,800
Sorry. Sorry.

454
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,130
Let us do it again.

455
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,310
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

456
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,780
The candidate is, her!

457
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,400
I...

458
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,470
Hi, I'm Ye Muxi.

459
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,250
I want to be your monitor.

460
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,330
I love hot pot.

461
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,110
And comics about Wonder Woman.

462
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,770
Well...

463
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,740
I don't know what I should say.

464
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,210
But I'll make you guys happy.

465
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,110
My academic performance sucks.

466
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,960
I have no experience on this aspect...

467
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,350
Ye Muxi, are you done?

468
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,990
I wanna be sworn brothers with you!

469
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,830
Yes, right, be sworn brothers with you.

470
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,490
My academic performance sucks all the time.

471
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,840
But because of this,

472
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,940
I understand the pressure that we students shoulder.

473
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,590
I'm not good-looking.

474
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,820
So no one has valued me.

475
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,480
But because of this, I know,

476
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,230
we students should respect and care about one another.

477
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,960
Besides, I have no prejudice against anyone.

478
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,890
I have neither experience nor plans.

479
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,440
But I can assure you,

480
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,290
if I'm your monitor,

481
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,900
my plan is to let you live in the moment.

482
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,010
I'll support everyone who has dream and unique ideas.

483
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,680
So, you'll be sworn brothers with me, right?

484
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,360
Do you want to let your youth shine?

485
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,200
Yes!

486
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,100
Do you want a totally unconventional monitor?

487
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,090
Yes!

488
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,630
Do you want to vote for me?

489
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,610
Yes!

490
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,360
Then tell me, what's my name?

491
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:22,140
Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi!

492
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,790
Stop!

493
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,100
Vote for me. Thank you.

494
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,230
Students, let me count the votes.

495
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,210
First of all,

496
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,210
Ye Muxi's votes.

497
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,790
Four.

498
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,260
Now, Liao Danyi's votes.

499
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,430
Three.

500
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,730
Mr. Wu, you gotta explain this.

501
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,300
To be honest, I understand your confusion.

502
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,980
Although it sounds ashamed,

503
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,700
I still gotta tell you the results.

504
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,700
During this voting,

505
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,410
only seven of you voted for your classmates.

506
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,860
Among the rest thirty-three votes,

507
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,450
twenty votes goes to Sunshine Girls.

508
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,340
Four or five votes goes to unknown Korean stars.

509
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,240
And some goes to the forth generation Naruto.

510
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,960
Ninja Turtles.

511
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,760
And on two votes it reads,

512
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,840
I'm Arthur. I'm durable.

513
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,880
Arthur is very durable.

514
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,680
I knew it's you guys!

515
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,160
What the hell?

516
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,180
So,

517
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,140
during this voting, only seven votes are valid.

518
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,140
Other classmates' waiver.

519
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,140
In future, the monitor of our class is

520
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,140
Ye Muxi.

521
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,610
Today shall be write down in history

522
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,820
and be remembered by the whole world.

523
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,620
Why?

524
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,410
Because as of today, I'm the big boss.

525
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,410
Not Liao Danyi!

526
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,560
And as of today, you guys follow me

527
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,440
to enjoy the life. What do you say?

528
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,320
Follow your leadership till the end!

529
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,830
Well, what should a monitor do?

530
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,270
What?

531
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,090
Anyway, it rocks!

532
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,340
It rocks!

533
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,140
Cheers!

534
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,070
Please give me a bottle of mineral water.

535
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,150
Isn't this our ordinary classmate Liao Danyi?

536
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,270
What are you doing here?

537
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,270
To comfort your penny soul?

538
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,470
We're both in the Class Committee now.

539
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,410
Try to get along well with each other.

540
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,840
Yes, we're...

541
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,510
Class... Class Committee?

542
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,400
That's to say, you're the monitor,
and I'm Commissary in charge of studies.

543
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,940
We're gonna manage Class Ten together.

544
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,130
Commissary in charge of studies...

545
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,430
After you're elected and went to celebrate,

546
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,770
we started to elect other committee members.

547
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,690
And I was elected as Commissary in charge of studies.

548
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,420
Commissary in charge of studies, what is your job?

549
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,070
Commissary in charge of studies is responsible for study progress.

550
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,030
If someone doesn't pay attention in class,

551
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,700
or draws little figures on books,

552
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,270
that should be managed by the Commissary in charge of studies.

553
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,220
But, Ye Muxi,

554
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
you won't be that bored, right?

555
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,310
After all, you're the monitor.

556
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,710
So, you'll still keep me under control?

557
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,740
You can think that.

558
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,070
Looking forward to work with you in this three years.

559
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,310
Big boss.

560
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,410
This is a world where light and darkness coexist.

561
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,250
Hope and despair interlock.

562
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,570
Evil forces are about to rise up

563
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,880
To devour my youth.

564
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,670
In this nervous vibe before the storm comes,

565
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,190
My three-year high school life as the monitor begins.
