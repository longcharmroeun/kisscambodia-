31
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,020
Spicy strip?

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,580
You like this?

33
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,850
Super delicious.

34
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,590
What happened to you two?

35
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,890
Who?

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,250
Liao Danyi. Had some kind of spat?

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,400
What?

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,410
Get over with it.

39
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,620
We're all friends!

40
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,310
Who is his friend?!

41
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,320
Obviously. You know who.

42
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,070
Zhu Shanqi. Listen to me.

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,070
Since I was young,

44
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,540
I always wanted to get rid of him.

45
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,080
But I just couldn't.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,340
He is like some shadow behind me.

47
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,990
I have nothing to do with him, like forever.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,060
Do you hear me?!

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,980
So you two need to cooperate on this.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,570
Wait.

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,900
It happened too fast.

52
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,440
Give me a minute.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,760
Is there anything that I can't complete by myself?

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,730
Well...

55
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,440
Just tell me.

56
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,320
It's a job for two.

57
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,150
So you two need to finish it together.

58
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,750
Your classmates, Wang Liangchen and Xu Meijing.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,740
They're very good friends.

60
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,290
It's a good thing to find a good friend at school.

61
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,170
But recently,

62
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,880
this pure relationship seems
to be heading for a bad direction.

63
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,150
So, to stop this pure friendship turning into

64
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,860
some dangerous thing for your age.

65
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,250
You two, please talk with those two students.

66
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,660
Tell them, at your age,

67
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,980
you should focus on study.

68
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,310
Wu sir.

69
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,620
I think you should talk with them. It'll be better.

70
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,040
I wish they could listen to me.

71
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,570
Besides, truth be told.

72
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,340
I have tried.

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,070
But they two laughed, very hard.

74
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,190
They told me they are just good friends.

75
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,820
And told me I was being paranoid.

76
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,810
In the end,

77
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,430
They gave me this sweater as a gift.

78
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,950
Nice handwork!

79
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,470
If they're really just pure friends like they said.

80
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,000
Then that will make me like that kind of rustic teacher!

81
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,430
No! I'm the coolest handsome Wu sir.

82
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,030
So I have to ask you two

83
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,920
to talk with Liangchen and Meijing nicely as their classmates.

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,180
To see if my concern is necessary

85
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,010
Or it was just in my head.

86
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,790
You're our Chinese teacher.

87
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,370
But, if they're really not that simple.

88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,230
What shall we do?

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,540
Then in class committee's name,

90
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,740
save them out from this fruitless relationship.

91
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,240
So I will take Wang Liangchen.

92
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,420
And you handle Xu Meijing.

93
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,800
Do you hear me?

94
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,140
Did I just hear some sound of the wind?

95
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,520
When will you stop ignoring me?

96
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,600
I really felt there's something!

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,920
But I don't know where.

98
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,000
Ye Muxi. You're so mature.

99
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,680
I'm not mature.

100
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,290
The commissary in charge of studies is so mature.

101
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,690
Not like a human!

102
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,450
Xiaotian shouldn't just wander in school.

103
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,780
So what?

104
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,640
You'll let them take it, and kill it?

105
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,950
Whatever you think.

106
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,720
That's because you can't answer me.

107
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm not doing this with you.

108
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,610
Then stay away from me.

109
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,060
Fine, stay away from Liangchen and Meijing.

110
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,530
Let me handle it alone.

111
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,450
You alone? Why?

112
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,470
I can do it as well.

113
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,020
I can handle it better than you.

114
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,440
Do you know what is love?

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,860
Do you have any experience?

116
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,360
Like you do.

117
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,700
At least I've watched many love movies.

118
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,130
Is there anything in those real?

119
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,820
Just some middle-aged men and women
stay at home and make it up!

120
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,810
It's art. You don't understand!

121
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,170
You said all of that to make your point.

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,850
Childish!

123
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,330
You're childish!

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,330
Say more and you're an idiot.

125
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,030
- I don't want...
- Idiot!

126
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,230
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

127
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,200
Idiot!

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,640
Hello.

129
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,110
Hello Meijing.

130
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,200
Can I sit here?

131
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,930
You already did.

132
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,590
Anything I can help with? Ye Muxi.

133
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,170
I found we barely talked before.

134
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,570
So let's talk.

135
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,660
Okay, okay.

136
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,690
Let's talk about love.

137
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,890
Love?

138
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,300
I think the most beautiful
and magical thing in the world is love.

139
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,130
What about you?

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,490
I think it's okay.

141
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,090
I saw a movie the other day.

142
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,350
About love.

143
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm so interested.

144
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,620
What movie?

145
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,480
Pleasant Goat.

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,490
Is there anything? Liao Danyi.

147
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,730
It's wrong.

148
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,770
Thank you. Liao Danyi.

149
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,650
I didn't think you're a man who likes to chat.

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,270
I didn't know you're so kind-hearted.

151
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,520
Look, we're having a great time.

152
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,320
Since that,

153
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,990
Then let's talk about...

154
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,140
Some secrets.

155
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,180
I think I'll pass.

156
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,660
It's okay. I'll go first.

157
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,630
Then you can tell me yours.

158
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,200
Okay.

159
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,630
My secret is

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,220
when no one is around

161
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,440
or when I am at home.

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,610
I'll sing and dance like a crazy person.

163
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,410
Especially when taking a shower.

164
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,480
I will take the shower caddy as my microphone.

165
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,730
And sing songs.

166
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,880
I'll make much noise.

167
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,070
Until my neighbor comes by to complain.

168
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,520
That is my secret.

169
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,940
Don't tell anyone.

170
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,720
What is yours?

171
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,580
[- Don't forget. Jinbao Street, 3p.m. tomorrow
- Okay, see you there.]

172
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,240
Well, Ye Muxi.

173
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,090
I've got to deal with something. I've to go now.

174
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,830
Wait, you...

175
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,040
Talk next time. Bye.

176
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,830
Wait, you can't let me talk in vain!

177
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,120
I just told you my secret!

178
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,770
Any other things I can help with?

179
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,810
Relationship.

180
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,140
Relationship... Sorry.

181
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,810
[- Don't forget. Jinbao Street, 3p.m. tomorrow
- Okay, see you there.]

182
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,260
What about relationship?

183
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,030
Nothing. I've gotta go now.

184
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,470
Wonder girl. Why summon us?

185
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,730
I do need to see you.

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,630
I want to ask you about love.

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,580
Love?

188
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,400
Mr. Wolong?

189
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,390
I'm a realistic man.

190
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,100
For a wife, virtuous is more important than good looking.

191
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,930
For a relationship, stable is more important than sweet.

192
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,730
So I don't know much about love.

193
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,940
Rumors say,

194
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,220
your wife looks...

195
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,980
Like a dinosaur.

196
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,900
You...

197
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,740
How could you say that about Mrs. Wolong?

198
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,420
What he said is true.

199
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,350
What about you?

200
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,650
His wife is quite beautiful.

201
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,120
But very fierce and tough.

202
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,180
How do you males talk like that?

203
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,830
If a girl is quite open,

204
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,980
you'll say she is fierce and tough right?

205
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,930
Tell me, you're based on what?

206
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,900
She has killed someone.

207
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,790
You men are really not helping.

208
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,180
Where's Hua Mulan?

209
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,560
Wait.

210
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,030
Dragon Shape Changing.

211
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm Hua Mulan!

212
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,090
Are... Are you sure?

213
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,810
That's right.

214
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,240
This is my style.

215
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,710
Think about it.

216
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,710
If I'm not like this,

217
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,600
then how could I pretend to be a man in the army?

218
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,560
Fine.

219
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,380
I want to ask you about love.

220
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,240
Don't know.

221
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,760
Why?

222
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,940
What you heard are all made up!

223
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,680
You guys really can't help me.

224
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,530
Can you be quiet?

225
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,110
Why you didn't study?

226
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,930
It's boring.

227
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,820
Then what is not boring?

228
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,790
Games.

229
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,550
What can those help you?

230
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,640
Makes me happy.

231
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,610
Useless.

232
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,270
When do you think my brother will come to pick me?

233
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
Don't know.

234
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,400
Let's play for a while.

235
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,050
You've been reading for such a long time.

236
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,040
Just five minutes.

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,900
Let's play for a while, okay?

238
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,440
Let's play hide and seek, okay?

239
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,430
If you can find me, I'll...

240
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,640
I'll stop and read books with you.

241
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,690
Don't wanna play.

242
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,850
Just for a while.

243
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,880
Let's play hide and seek, okay?

244
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,280
Don't wanna play.

245
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,630
Just for a while.

246
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,030
Let's play.

247
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,160
Fine.

248
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,160
Then I'll go hide first.

249
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,540
You count to one hundred.

250
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,040
One. Two. Three...

251
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,260
Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine. One hundred.

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,610
She is finally gone.

253
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,210
I can do my Mathematical Olympiad again.

254
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,050
Normal friends watch movies at weekend together.

255
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,460
Liao Danyi.

256
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,410
Let me finish this well.

257
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,870
Wait and watch me.

258
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,330
But it's so far away.

259
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,190
I wish I had a telescope.

260
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,600
Thank you.

261
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,280
You... What're you doing here?

262
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,310
I was gonna ask you that.

263
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,750
How did you know they're gonna watch movies together?

264
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,230
I saw Meijing's ticket booking message on her phone.

265
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,100
Me too.

266
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,260
So what now?

267
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,790
Play it by ear.

268
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,420
Let's see how this relationship works.

269
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,470
A cup of hot milk tea. Hurry.

270
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,050
Right now. Now! I'm thirsty.

271
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,090
Okay, wait a second.

272
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,150
This, two for this one.

273
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,290
This and this.

274
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,470
This and this.

275
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
This and this. Add.

276
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,750
They're in the shopping mall.

277
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,810
Okay, let's go in.

278
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,390
After they got in.

279
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,860
We followed them for a day.

280
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,880
But they didn't hug nor join hands.

281
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,970
No kiss either.

282
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,590
Does pure friendship really
exist between a boy and a girl?

283
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,820
Then why am I here?

284
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,410
Did I just waste a day?

285
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,430
Hello, you two.

286
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm the owner here.

287
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,360
You two are very lucky.

288
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,550
You're the one thousandth couple in our store.

289
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,750
We have a prize for that!

290
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,100
Sir, we're not a couple.

291
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,410
We're not!

292
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,580
Not what you think.

293
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,740
We're not a couple.

294
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,600
Here, here. Super ice cream.

295
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,540
Dear, I'm so happy.

296
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,170
I'm so lucky to have you! God!

297
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,210
Ice cream! Can I have a spoon?

298
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,750
Okay. Okay.

299
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,610
A spoon!

300
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,900
Right, right. That's right.

301
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,980
Do you want one? No?

302
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,000
I want this. I'll eat. I'll eat.

303
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,490
They're just playing together.

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,920
What?

305
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,450
If I don't actually use it, they'll see us!

306
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,260
Then I want that tiger.

307
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,160
Okay.

308
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,780
No intimate moves.

309
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,080
Wu sir and us can relax now.

310
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,600
Luckily I didn't miss the opening.

311
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
Don't forget why we're doing this in here.

312
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,820
No talking in the movie theater.

313
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,360
Don't you know that?

314
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,950
They're in a flower shop.

315
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,600
Should have some moves.

316
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,360
They didn't do a thing for so long.

317
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,530
We should leave!

318
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,470
Wait!

319
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,850
Rose! Rose!

320
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,540
Proof of love!

321
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,650
Go out, now! now!

322
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,030
Calm down, calm down.

323
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,870
They changed it.

324
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,880
Why lily?!

325
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm done! I'm exhausted!

326
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,160
I give up.

327
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,370
I'm so tired.

328
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,530
We can't just continue like this.

329
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,880
Congrats! You're the ninety-ninth couple in our store.

330
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,860
Here, a free bouquet for you two.

331
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,370
Why this is happening again?

332
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,750
Don't take it then.

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,160
70 Yuan for a salad?

334
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,940
Don't order it if you find it expensive.

335
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,890
You're kidding me.

336
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,870
Order whatever you want.

337
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,960
It's okay, I'll pay.

338
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,580
Okay.

339
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,590
Steak looks nice.

340
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,820
Lobster! Lobster!

341
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,180
Waitress, how big is the lobster?

342
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,100
Do you have hotpot?

343
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,900
You look a little nervous.

344
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,780
What?

345
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,340
It's not your first time to eat with a boy, right?

346
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,730
Are you kidding me?

347
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,640
I eat with boys every day!

348
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,860
Like wash my face and brush my teeth. Daily!

349
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,990
What does it feel to have dinner with a boy alone?

350
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Just fine.

351
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,490
We're too far away.

352
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,480
What're they talking about?

353
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
How would I know?

354
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,810
Must be some other topic.

355
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,610
They look quite enjoying it.

356
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,070
You can't tell that.

357
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,170
Look.

358
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,650
Liangchen, don't you think our monitor is so beautiful?

359
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,560
She is so great.

360
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,500
I want to be her closest friend.

361
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,370
Not a good idea.

362
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,030
I heard she's gonna immigrate to Mars once she graduates.

363
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,330
Okay, Liangchen. I admit it.

364
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,560
In fact, I'm a robot.

365
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,970
I'm here to save the world.

366
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,270
Face the reality.

367
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,190
They're talking sweet things to each other.

368
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,300
Like...

369
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,090
I'm so happy today!

370
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,130
Can hang out with such an amazing person!

371
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm also feel so happy

372
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,710
to eat and shop with such a charming girl.

373
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,040
Do you really think I'm charming?

374
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,400
I really do.

375
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,040
And what attracts me is your charisma.

376
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,310
Really?

377
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,600
Yeah.

378
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,380
It feels so strange.

379
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,570
As a man, I should hate to go to the shopping mall.

380
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,070
But when you're around.

381
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,880
I always find time flies.

382
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,990
Really?

383
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,330
Yes.

384
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,390
They're about to leave.

385
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,870
Are they really friends or a couple?

386
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,990
Maybe friends.

387
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,820
But does pure friendship really exist
between a boy and a girl?

388
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,570
How would I know?

389
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,260
I don't have any male friend.

390
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,540
You don't think we are....

391
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,600
We're just neighbors.

392
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,860
Grew up together.

393
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,730
That's all.

394
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,820
Anything else?

395
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,870
You're the person I hate the most in the world.

396
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,780
Then why did you always come
play with me when you were young?

397
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,910
Because I was blind.

398
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,110
But, you were so nice when you were young.

399
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,330
I didn't know since when

400
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,110
you became so so so annoying.

401
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,580
Always pointing fingers.

402
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,250
Won't let me draw pictures in class.

403
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,730
Won't let me do bla bla bla.

404
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,380
Won't let me play games, etc.

405
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,710
Of course I would hate you.

406
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,930
I just want you to be a little mature.

407
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,700
So you can take care of yourself.

408
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,720
It's my own business. Not yours!

409
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,240
They seem okay to me.

410
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,450
Let's call it a day.

411
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,860
Waiter.

412
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,670
Congrats, you two.

413
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,680
You're the one thousandth couple in our store.

414
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,120
You can get 70% off.

415
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,770
Hello, hello.

416
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,320
Liao Danyi, what brought you here?

417
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,050
Co..incidence?

418
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,580
Exhausted.

419
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,550
I wasted a whole day which I could study a lot.

420
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,150
Danyi, did you see Yezi?

421
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,620
I didn't.

422
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,310
Shouldn't be.

423
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,700
She should be home at this hour.

424
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,310
Besides, I made her favorite hotpot today.

425
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,760
Where could she go?

426
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,680
Right, Danyi.

427
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,540
Come,come.

428
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,910
Think about it.

429
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,310
Have you seen her?

430
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,260
Where could she go?

431
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay, Danyi.

432
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,240
I'll go out to look for her.

433
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,130
If you hear anything about her,

434
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,300
Come to my house to tell me, okay?

435
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,620
Good kid.

436
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,460
Can't be it....

437
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,580
She wouldn't hide until now.

438
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,630
It has been five hours.

439
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,710
Ye Muxi.

440
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,310
Ye Muxi.

441
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,230
Come out. You win.

442
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,610
Ye Muxi.

443
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,230
Ye Muxi.

444
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,690
Ye Muxi.

445
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,050
Ye Muxi.

446
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,320
God. Please.

447
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,500
Let me find Ye Muxi.

448
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,930
I promise. If I find her.

449
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,780
I'll take the responsibility to guide her.

450
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,660
Before she is able to undertake something alone.

451
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,900
I will always be by her side.

452
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,810
So please god.

453
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
Let me find her.

454
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,270
Ye Muxi. What're you doing here?

455
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,130
Liao Danyi, you found me!

456
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,680
Let's go home.

457
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,660
It's your turn to hide now.

458
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,000
Another day.

459
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,000
Let's go home to have some hotpot okay?

460
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Okay

461
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,730
Liao Danyi. You really suck at this.

462
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,850
It took you such a long time.

463
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,720
Right. Ye Muxi.

464
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,270
Sorry.

465
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Next time, wherever you hide,

466
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,810
I'll find you at once.

467
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,120
You promise?

468
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,970
I promise.

469
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,440
[Examination Room]
Teacher, I finished it.

470
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,530
I did the math. If I miss one exam.

471
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,640
Our scores should be close.

472
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,070
I'm just keeping my word.

473
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,060
Ye Muxi and Liao Danyi followed us today.

474
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,990
But they didn't find our relationship.

475
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,820
Right, they're too naive.

476
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,730
Our camouflage has no flaw.

477
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,010
Because we are...

478
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,550
Abracadabra

479
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,450
Meijing.

480
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,810
We've been hiding in this country for so long.

481
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,840
Waiting to find the soul of Chinese Kungfu.

482
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,320
Meijing, let's go.

483
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,140
Alright.

484
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,120
That's what they are?!
