one two Three

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
O beauty

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You dropped something

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I didn't drop anything

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, I didn't drop anything

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You lost a boyfriend

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You lost a boyfriend

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please pick him up

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,340
This is fun

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,380
This is our new study of tricks

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Is there any effect?

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,000
How?

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
To know this kind of stuff

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All right, all right

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Everybody be quiet

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I've called you all over

51
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,000
to discuss about the class committee

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,000
The problem of our distracting activities

53
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,000
Everybody knows that

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We set up Class 10 committee

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In order to help students to study better

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In order to help students to study better

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
But what have we been doing lately?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Someone went to look for the lost cat in the tree

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Someone went to look for the lost cat in the tree

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Others helped the teacher find the missing wallet

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Others helped the teacher find the missing wallet

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And someone else

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Goes and buys some snacks for girls

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Goes and buys some snacks for girls

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
However

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That girl is poor, too

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That girl is poor, too

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How sad it is to not buy a snack!

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes we have no way but to help her

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes we have no way but to help her

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If that's the case

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We simply don't call it Class 10 committee

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We simply don't call it Class 10 committee

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Call it society for good people and charitable acts

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Call it society for good people and charitable acts

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,580
How's that?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So Ye Muqi

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You act as a monitor

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I need you to set an example

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I need you to set an example

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Refuse to delegate something that has nothing to do with learning

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Refuse to delegate something that has nothing to do with learning

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Refuse to delegate something that has nothing to do with learning

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
You have the courage to say no.

85
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,420
No

86
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,160
I didn't tell you to say no this time

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Excuse me for interrupting

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Monitor, Committee, hello

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Monitor, Committee, hello

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have something to ask you for help

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sorry for interrupting you

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sorry for interrupting you

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is this something to do with your study?

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,140
Is this something to do with your study?

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It doesn't seem to matter much

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It doesn't seem to matter much

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It doesn't seem to matter much

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You see

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This has nothing to do with learning

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This has nothing to do with learning

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can have the courage to say no.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can have the courage to say no.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
No

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's say it

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's your problem?

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We can certainly help

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come on, tell us

108
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
It happened like this

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have something to discuss with you

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have something to discuss with you

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's up?

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm playing game. Wait a minute

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I just wanted to ask you

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,640
I just wanted to ask you

116
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,140
Wait a second!

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,000
Actually, I just wanted to ask you

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If between the game and me you can only choose one

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If between the game and me you can only choose one

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who would you choose?

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's break up

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Finally opened a treasure box

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Finally opened a treasure box

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Break up??

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why not wait?

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why not wait?

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I haven't had time to open my chest

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I haven't had time to open my chest

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why is the cell phone running out of battery?

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why is the cell phone running out of battery?

133
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,820
There's one percent battery left...

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Treasure

135
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,000
I really can't help it

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Control myself, while playing the game

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Just because

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Just because of playing games

139
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,000
The most important person in my life left me

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The most important person in my life left me

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But the time when I play everyday

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But the time when I play everyday

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But the time when I play everyday

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I can't control myself

145
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,380
No problem

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,100
It's good for you to realize the problem

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
We are sure to help

148
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,000
You don't know I'm sober now

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You don't know, I'm sober now, but...

150
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Once I start playing

151
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't even know what I'm doing

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No matter where, what occasion

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No matter where, what occasion

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll play with my cell phone

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't even know when I was in my mind

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't even know when I was in my mind

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
thinking about something

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
So I beg you to help me

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be sure to help me quit this hard habit

160
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,000
I ask you to keep my cell phone

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No matter what I say, no matter what I do

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No matter what I say, no matter what I do

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How can I ask you?

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
Never give it to me

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then I'll take care of it for you

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then I'll take care of it for you

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good

168
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Come, for a change, a magic trick for everyone

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Draw a card

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
See clearly?

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't see it. I couldn't see it

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
OK, I'll shuffle first

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Six of hearts

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Very good, very good

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Very good, very good

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
One more time, one more time

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It sounds like I heard my cell phone ringing

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It sounds like I heard my cell phone ringing

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, your cell phone is mute

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, your cell phone is mute

183
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
No sound!

184
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,000
Illusion, illusion, beat it

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's your turn

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We'll do again

187
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
Draw another one

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The magic deck gives optimistic vibes

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Three of hearts

191
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I really heard that

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Something important must be up to me

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Something important has come up to me

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe my mother called me

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Maybe my mother called me

196
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or my friend was in a car accident

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Or my friend was in a car accident

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey classmate

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You have to control yourself

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You have to control yourself

201
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,460
Sit down

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I hurry up!

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hurry up

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Shall we change two?

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Two, you come, you come

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I heard it. I really heard it

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I heard it. I really heard it

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It must be my cell phone ringtone

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't move

210
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
You listen

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's from your mouth

212
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,460
Give back

213
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey student

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Give it back to me.

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My cell phone

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My cell phone

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You control him

218
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,300
Give back

219
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,000
Control him!

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I regained consciousness

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you, class leader. Thank you

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you, class leader. Thank you

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was nothing

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Disperse, Disperse, Disperse

225
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,380
Wait

226
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,000
We'll hide one of your cell phones

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
We'll hide one of your cell phones

228
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Where you can never find it

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hello everyone

230
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,000
What's up, mate?

231
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
I've really figured it out

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're all for me

233
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
I know. I promise not to play with my cell phone

234
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,300
Really?

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am calm and serene

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I am calm and serene

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I think I can even move forward

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think I can even move forward

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,760
A new step has taken place

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,940
That's good

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,540
Monitor

242
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,500
I don't know how to say. Can I be friends with you?

243
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,000
All right

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Would you like to add a WeChat to your phone?

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes, you can

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You see, my cell phone isn't on me right now

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You see, my cell phone is not on me now

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can use your mobile phone

249
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Type in my cell phone number?

250
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,000
Ye Muqi, wait

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ye Muqi, wait

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You type too fast, I haven't said mine yet

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You type too fast, I haven't said mine yet

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You type too fast, I haven't said mine yet

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Return my cell phone

256
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,540
run

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I must stop him

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Stop him quickly

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Return my cell phone

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Return my cell phone

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Return my cell phone

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Return my cell phone

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Return my cell phone

264
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Return my cell phone

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Return my cell phone

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Dry three Kun six fault

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Dry three Kun six fault

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The vibration of the Yang and the interior of the Yang

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Shake the back and leave the inner cavity empty

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Shake the back and leave the inner cavity empty

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Today's purple micro-star red bull fighting

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Today's purple micro-star red bull fighting

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This is the location

274
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Right at this moment

275
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,400
In my hand

276
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,240
Class leader

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Next

278
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,000
Return my cell phone

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Girls, have mercy

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sorry everyone, I was wrong

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry everyone, I was wrong

282
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,000
I couldn't control myself

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What should we do then?

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What should we do then?

285
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's play together

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
I think that's only our way to help him

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think that's only our way to help him

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He's in the game world

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We need to recognize reality through his eyes

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We need to recognize reality through his eyes

291
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,160
This is the best treatment

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tibetan mobile phone

293
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
We can hide for a while

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But a temporary solution does not cure

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, then, we

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, then, we

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Download together

298
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,000
Surprise inspection

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello, Ms. President

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you doing here?

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you doing here?

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you doing here?

303
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm president of the student union

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It is compulsory to check all classes

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It is compulsory to check all classes

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I want to look at the dubious students

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
To see the students who are dubious

308
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,000
In what frivolous activities

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
they are wasting time

310
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,380
Nothing really

311
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,000
Here we are ready to play a game

312
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Here we are ready to play a game

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, what?

314
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's OK for us to have a rest and play games

315
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's OK for us to have a rest and play games

316
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's also true that we can play games at break time

317
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I tell you

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Drama is the first big poison to affect learning

319
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Playing is the first poison in learning

320
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
You are trying to sell this idea here

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Does that suit you?

322
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What about the game?

323
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In fact, it is not a simple game

324
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In fact, it is not a simple game

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
In fact, it is not a simple game

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's the process of playing games

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's the process of playing games

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
To help this student quit his habit

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
To help this student quit his habit

330
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So this game is not actually playing

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So this game is not actually playing

332
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It can promote friendship among students

333
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It can promote friendship among students

334
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't believe it

335
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,000
If you do not believe us,

336
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you can play too

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You dare not?

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You dare not?

339
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You fear that we'll win!

340
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How could I possibly lose to you guys?

341

351
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is pretty interesting

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's get started.

353
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait a minute

354
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't have any interest in games

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I won't play

356
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000

Quite true

370
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And you are?

371
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't you wake up like that?

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Whatever good or bad you learnt

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Whatever good or bad you learnt

after months of studying with master carpenter

376
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,000
Does not mean you do your own repair

377
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, you can't do it yourself

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No, you can't do it yourself

is no quality to boast about

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000

Spring comes

398
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000

I don't know what to do

431
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Monitor

432
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's quite similar

450
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The Shushan School of Shu characters

451

Is not a typo.

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But I spent a lot of money

453
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You should have chosen a school

463
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What about your favorite artifact?

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You don't understand

481
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You don't understand

482
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Who says that?

843
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What is written on the instruction?

844
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What is written on the instruction?

845
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Instructions

846
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Who can see such a small word?

847
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,560
That's too much

848
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't you think it's a little strange?

849
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Don't you think it's a little strange?

850
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
He kept hitting him with his eyes closed

851
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He kept hitting him with his eyes closed

852
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's where he is really powerful

853
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's where he is really powerful

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,920
Then we

855
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,460
Wait

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Liao Danyi, be careful

857
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,340
Sir

858
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Old gentleman

859
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Is this is what you have been looking for?

860
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is this is what you have been looking for?

861
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It is found

862
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I was afraid, really scared

863
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I was looking for half a day

864
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
A lot of people are attacking me

865
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Thank you

866
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It is OK

867
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,400
Goodbye

868
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What's the situation?

869
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This

870
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The game is like this

871
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There are many wonderful ways to play

872
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There are many wonderful ways to play

873
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
That's wonderful, too

874
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,480
This is really...

875
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,440
Wait

876
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
He's here to see me

877
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
White warrior

878
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We have a lot of fate crossing paths with this kid

879
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We have a lot of fate crossing paths with this kid

880
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Surely the hero is waiting for me here

881
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Surely the hero is waiting for me here

882
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Surely the hero is waiting for me here

883
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,280
That is true

884
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Although I seem to be an alcoholic

885
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Although I seem to be an alcoholic

886
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Although I seem to be an alcoholic

887
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
They all call me old white

888
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
They all call me old white

889
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So what?

890
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Rivers and lakes say I have another title

891
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Rivers and lakes say I have another title

892
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Rivers and lakes say I have another title

893
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Rivers and lakes say I have another title

894
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm called the Wine Sword Fairy

895
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm called the Wine Sword Fairy

896
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I've heard so much about you

897
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
At first I met the latter

898
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
At first I met the latter

899
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Found you to be great in bones

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Found you to be great in bones

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I want to teach you all my life's wisdom

902
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I want to teach you all my life's wisdom

903
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I want to teach you all my life's wisdom

904
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Please master, accept your disciple's worship

905
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But after meeting you

906
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But after meeting you

907
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I met the man again

908
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,600
I met the man again

909
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Could you tell me where I am?

910
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
May I ask where I am inferior to him?

911
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're mistaken

912
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's true

913
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I met this young man later

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I met this young man later

915
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Talked with him for a long time

916
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Talked with him for a long time

917
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Suddenly I realized the true meaning of life

918
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Suddenly I realized the true meaning of life

919
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Suddenly I realized the true meaning of life

920
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Understood the harm of alcohol on the body

921
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Understood the harm of alcohol on the body

922
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Understood the harm of alcohol on the body

923
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Alcohol really does harm to your health

924
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Alcohol really does harm to your health

925
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So I've stopped drinking

926
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So I've stopped drinking

927
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So I've stopped drinking

928
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,000
But what?

929
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
There is a very sad news

930
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because my lifelong knowledge

931
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because my lifelong knowledge

932
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Only after I finish drinking

933
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
can it exert true power

934
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
can it exert true power

935
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,460
So

936
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,000
I've been here waiting for you a long time

937
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I've been here waiting for you a long time

938
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Just to tell you

939
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Just to tell you

940
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
There's nothing I can teach you

941
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's nothing I can teach you

942
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,540
Farewell

943
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,000
Listen

944
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,580
You think I'm not going to teach you anything?

945
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
Will I let you go?

946
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I will pass you two words of wisdom

947
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I will pass you two words of wisdom

948
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Remember

949
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
White wine, liver injury, beer, kidney injury

950
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
White wine, liver injury, beer, kidney injury

951
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
White wine, liver injury, beer, kidney injury

952
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
White wine, liver injury, beer, kidney injury

953
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
White wine, liver injury, beer, kidney injury

954
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I love this game

955
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I love this game

956
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
jump

957
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
jump

958
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
jump

959
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Jump for fun, jump, jump

960
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Jump for fun, jump, jump

961
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Jump for fun, jump, jump

962
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Jump for fun, jump, jump

963
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Jump for fun, jump, jump

964
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Ye Muxi

965
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Why are you jumping?

966
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I like to dance, OK?

967
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I just love jumping

968
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Jump into the river and take a bath

969
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Jump into the river and take a bath

970
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,680
Stop

971
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,500
Here is the main task of the game

972
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,280
Fairy Island

973
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,220
What, fairy island?

974
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I would say this place is so familiar.

975
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I would say this place is so familiar.

976
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Imitation Legend of Sword and Fairy right

977
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Imitation Legend of Sword and Fairy right

978
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I know the background story

979
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's peeping a bath

980
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's peeping a bath

981
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll go first

982
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,000
Let's go

983
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Good ridicule

984
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,000
What kind of thing are you?

985
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What kind of thing are you?

986
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I just didn't think anything had happened

987
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I just didn't think anything had happened

988
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,260
My eyes

989
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,000
I will waste my eyes

990
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Shouldn't there be a good spirit?

991
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Shouldn't there be a good spirit?

992
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Why a grandma?

993
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Game settings are like this

994
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Game settings are like this

995
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
If it's not full of diamonds

996
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If it's not full of diamonds

997
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The ratio of spirits and grandmother

998
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's one to ninety-nine

999
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's one to ninety-nine

1000
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Wouldn't it be impossible to see the spirit?

1001
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,880
Wouldn't it be impossible to see the spirit?

1002
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
They are all grandma

1003
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
In fact, it is not possible to get herbs

1004
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
In fact, it is not possible to get herbs

1005
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In fact, it is not possible to get herbs

1006
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,100
'cause

1007
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
It depends on the broadsword in my hand

1008
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It depends on the broadsword in my hand

1009
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,180
It still seems we're going to have to fight

1010
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,120
Fight

1011
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,340
Calm down everyone

1012
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,920
We shouldn't beat her at her level

1013
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
There are two more options

1014
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What options?

1015
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Impress grandma, one is defeated

1016
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Impress grandma, one is defeated

1017
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Then impress,

1018
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I suggest

1019
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Actually, you want to convince me

1020
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Actually, you want to convince me

1021
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Nor is it not possible

1022
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But it depends on whether you are sincere or not

1023
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But it depends on whether you are sincere or not

1024
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But it depends on whether you are sincere or not

1025
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That boy, you look exceedingly handsome

1026
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That boy, you look exceedingly handsome

1027
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That boy, you look exceedingly handsome

1028
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Can we talk alone?

1029
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Can we talk alone?

1030
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,520
Then you can go

1031
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,000
Give these two people some space and take a walk around the place

1032
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:02,980
Ye Muxi

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You

1034
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Me, I'm leaving too

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Me, I'm leaving too

1036
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,000
What do they call you, young man?

1037
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What do they call you, young man?

1038
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What are you doing, young man?

1039
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What are you doing, young man?

1040
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Recharge

1041
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Five diamond can skip this task

1042
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Five diamond can skip this task

1043
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,000
Herbal medicine, I've got it

1044
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
I'll take leave

1045
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,220
Young man

1046
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,540
Young man...

1047
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Don't leave, young man, please

1048
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,360
Herb took us back to the Inn

1049
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
The game's over

1050
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes

1051
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's go

1052
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm not going to let you pass

1053
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,000
You're all gonna die here

1054
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Especially the ungrateful one

1055
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Especially the ungrateful one

1056
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I have not spent money

1057
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I have not spent money

1058
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Did you skip the task?

1059
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You can jump over this task

1060
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You can jump over this task

1061
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You can't jump my heart

1062
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,580
Die!

1063
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Kill

1064
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,000
Wait

1065
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If we go on like this, we'll be destroyed

1066
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If we go on like this, we'll be destroyed

1067
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,300
Be careful!

1068
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You are no match for her

1069
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
She took it with her hands

1070
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Add five dragon wood knives

1071
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Add five dragon wood knives

1072
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
God

1073
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's level fifty equipment

1074
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's level fifty equipment

1075
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Could it be..

1076
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
She bought the equipment at the mall

1077
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Eat until you get to level 50

1078
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Now I'm in the game

1079
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The strongest being

1080
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The strongest being

1081
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This game really burns money

1082
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This game really burns money

1083
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
She really did this kind of injustice, big head!

1084
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
She really did this kind of injustice, big head!

1085
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's a lot of money

1086
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What a pity!

1087
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It costs a lot of money

1088
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,500
Really does

1089
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Where could I be so stupid?

1090
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's embarrassing

1091
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, my God, embarrassed, really

1092
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
To say such a thing!

1093
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Embarrassed to speak out

1094
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What do you think?

1095
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's embarrassing

1096
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I am embarrassed

1097
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,320
Bring it on

1098
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,000
Die!

1099
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,000
Fell down, she fell down

1100
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Enemy fell down, but she's still fighting

1101
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Is she crazy?

1102
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Is she crazy?

1103
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Die!

1104
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Die!

1105
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Come on, let's go. Let's go

1106
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Come on, let's go. Let's go

1107
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Let's go, walk, walk

1108
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's go, walk, walk

1109
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,000
That's the end of the game

1110
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,000
Still, it's a really fun game

1111
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Still, it's a really fun game

1112
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But it's not addictive, either

1113
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But it's not addictive, either

1114
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But it's not addictive, either

1115
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,000
Hit it!

1116
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Cover up

1117
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Cover up

1118
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
In front

1119
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I wanted to ask you about the game and me

1120
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I wanted to ask you about the game and me

1121
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you can only choose one

1122
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Who would you choose?

1123
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Let's break up

1124
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,360
I figured it out

1125
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Crazy obsession game

1126
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,000
In your eyes, it turned out to be so funny

1127
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,000
You can understand that

1128
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Even if you can get the king

1129
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
What about being a God?

1130
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's all game developers

1131
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That's all game developers

1132
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Let people get in the virtual world

1133
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Real life is not in vanity

1134
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and it's satisfaction

1135
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,000
So it's not too late for you to wake up now

1136
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So it's not too late for you to wake up now

1137
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:46,960
True

1138
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,420
In this game, I am

1139
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,000
wasting too much money

1140
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,880
I forgot that adage

1141
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,000
Good times never return

1142
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's okay

1143
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You know

1144
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,000
Maybe she's not far away

1145
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Maybe she's not far away

1146
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Maybe she's in some corner

1147
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Maybe she's in some corner

1148
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Waiting for you to go back?

1149
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,100
Really?

1150
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Dragon Sword

1151
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I got a new dragon knife. Do you want it?

1152
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I got a new dragon knife. Do you want it?

1153
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
No, no, no, I don't

1154
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm going, I'm to look for for what I lost

1155
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm going, I'm to look for for what I lost

1156
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm going, I'm to look for for what I lost

1157
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Strange

1158
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Finally, one thing was solved perfectly

1159
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Finally, one thing was solved perfectly

1160
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Finally, one thing was solved perfectly

1161
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,940
Was it?

1162
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,000
I always feel that more than one was addicted to online games

1163
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I always feel that more than one was addicted to online games

1164
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I always feel that more than one was addicted to online games

1165
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Cover up

1166
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Cover up

1167
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,000
It's getting late

1168
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Let's go to the snack bar

1169
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
OK, OK

1170
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,700
Let's take a walk

1171
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,000
By the way, I know a shop

1172
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The shop is particularly good on.

1173
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's delicious. I'll tell you

1174
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's delicious. I'll tell you

1175
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,000
I have a clear mind now.

1176
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I repented. I'm sorry.

1177
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,260
What are you doing?

1178
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm playing games

1179
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm playing games

1180
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,000
Playing games

1181
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Didn't you want me to play the game?

1182
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Didn't you want me to play the game?

1183
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Didn't you want me to play the game?

1184
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I now find that

1185
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's much more fun than you

1186
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,640
# Looked up at the Ferris wheel around the Starlight #

1187
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:43,700
# The moon is beside you with the breeze #

1188
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:52,200
# Which cloud is crying, I don't know who's grieving #

1189
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:01,740
# Tears are falling with rain you're blocking me #

1190
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:14,400
# Another good soap opera plot plays in my head #

1191
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:24,460
# There's no point in the story of his thousand-percent turns #

1192
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:32,220
# That heavy rain encounter in your umbrella low #

1193
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:43,420
# Or we never have met before, that would be a better plot here #

1194
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,640
# I'm missing you #

1195
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,360
# I'm thinking of the dew that quivering drips #

1196
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:22,660
# Falling in the water beside the road to reflect your figure #

1197
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:31,760
# On the blackboard in the corner dust has been reluctant to leave #

1198
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:41,600
# You lost your ballpoint pen all the time here #

1199
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:54,340
# That heavy rain encounter in your umbrella low #

1200
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:04,740
# Or we have never met before, that would be better plot here #

1201
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,240
# I'm missing you #
