00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,555
You can have this.

3
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,931
You don't want it?

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,766
I have to watch my weight.

5
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,476
I see. Okay.

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,730
There's an excellent way to burn calories.

7
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,525
-What is it?
-Karaoke.

8
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,027
What do you think?
Let's skip self-study class.

9
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,445
No. I have to study.

10
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,239
I'm busy with practice.

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,120
Jeez, look at these poor
Korean high school students.

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,956
You didn't go last time
even when I said I'd pay.

13
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,791
How can you do this to your friend?

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,044
Let's just go sing for an hour.

15
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,506
Even if they give us extra minutes,
I won't take them.

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,924
Come on, what do you say?

17
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,176
-Will you, Ha-young?
-No.

00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
What's the score? Is it 100?

36
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,420
Is it really 100?

37
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,673
-Yes!
-We did it!

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,011
TIME

39
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,721
We have a minute left.

KARAOKE ROOM

41
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,276
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you? What are you doing?</i>

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,070
<i>The meet is only a few days away.</i>

43
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,531
Don't worry. I'm going home now.

44
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,495
What is it? Is something wrong?

45
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,330
It's nothing.

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,041
This was actually
my first karaoke experience.

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,751
Really?

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,087
The coach never let me
because of training.

49
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,716
Now you'll ask me to take you
to karaoke all the time.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,762
I have a swim meet this weekend.
Do you want to come?

51
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,680
What?

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,393
How much will it cost me?

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,520
It's free, of course.

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,480
Just come. I'll even buy you dinner.

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,024
That's unfair.
Are you only treating Sol-i?

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,193
Of course not. You're invited, too.

57
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,361
You should all come.

58
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,989
Okay. We'll go and cheer for you.

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,618
By the way, why do I feel chilly
all of a sudden?

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,328
What? What do you mean?

61
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,289
It's the dean.

62
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,343
What was the combination?

63
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,555
Why can't I remember it?

64
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,348
My bike is gone.

65
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,354
Oh, no.

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,899
Just leave it.

67
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's go.

68
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,237
Brother, hop on.

69
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,133
You lost your bike?

70
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,303
I bought you that bike recently.
How many have you lost now?

71
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,013
Come here.

72
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,307
Mom, that's a weapon.

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,935
If you aren't careful,
you can kill someone with that.

74
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,604
Don't worry. I'll be careful. Come here!

75
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,772
-Mom.
-Come over here.

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,232
Dad, save me.

77
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,984
How did you lose it this time?

78
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,695
I was buying a workbook at a bookstore.

79
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,824
Mom, a lot of other kids
lost their bikes there, too.

80
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,619
She was at a bookstore
buying a workbook for studying.

81
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,288
The father-and-daughter team
always make me the bad guy.

82
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,666
What's the point in working
on new recipes day and night

83
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,543
when you two keep spending all the money?

84
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,878
Come on, we don't spend all of it.

85
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,505
Plus, I help you a lot.

86
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,216
Buy a new bike this weekend.

87
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,718
-Don't whine about taking the bus.
-What?

88
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,513
No.

89
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,477
I should've just let her buy me
a new bike.

90
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,565
Why am I going through this trouble
to ride on the back of Heon's bike?

91
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,234
My legs hurt.

92
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,701
Hey, Brother.
It's tough without a bicycle, isn't it?

93
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,454
I can't complain. I brought it on myself.

94
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,623
I can take you to school
until you get a new bike.

95
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,292
No, it's okay.

96
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,336
I have a question.

97
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,756
What do you want others to do for you
when you're sad?

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,300
Well, I don't know.

99
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,886
When I'm sad,

100
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,014
wouldn't it mean the most
to just keep that person company?

101
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,057
Oh, really?

102
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,183
Yes.

103
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,611
I'LL HELP YOU!

104
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,576
Everyone did a great job.

105
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,914
So many of your assignments touched me.

106
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,292
Especially Hui-ji's and Cha Heon's.

107
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,212
It didn't seem like
they were written by students.

108
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,048
I almost thought you were writers.

109
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,299
Speaking of which,

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,510
Sol-i, would you mind reading this?

111
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,473
-Pardon?
-Read it out loud.

112
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,060
Okay.

113
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,230
NAME: CHA HEON

114
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,363
"One day when I was eight,

115
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,199
I got lost in an unfamiliar place.

116
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,744
I felt like crying,

117
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,580
but I held back my tears,
saying I would never cry.

118
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,166
After some time passed,

119
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,002
-<i>my father came to look for me.</i>"
-Heon!

120
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,337
Dad!

121
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,215
"<i>I burst into tears and ended up crying.</i>"

122
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,842
-"<i>My father simply looked at me.</i>"
-It's okay.

123
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,136
-"<i>He gave me a warm hug.</i>"
-It's all right.

124
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,974
"<i>Then, my father and I</i>
<i>went to a Chinese restaurant</i>

125
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,143
<i>and ate </i>jajangmyeon<i>, my favorite dish.</i>

126
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,938
<i>My father's hand,</i>

127
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,984
<i>which I held all the way back home,</i>
<i>was very warm.</i>

128
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,869
It was the longest day
I spent with my father,

129
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,916
who was always busy with work."

130
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,717
Do you still have <i>jajangmyeon</i> with him?

131
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,854
Heon, my mom will make bulgogi tomorrow,
do you want to come?

132
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,565
No.

133
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,818
Then, can I ride this bike with you?

134
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,904
I'll be quiet and won't bother you.

135
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm super light like a feather.

136
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,324
What do you say?

137
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,203
You can take the bike, then.

138
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
Where are you going?

139
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,959
Can't I come with you?

140
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,837
Don't follow me.

141
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,253
All right.

142
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,715
It'll be hard for Heon
to prepare everything on his own.

143
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,720
And I don't think it's a bad idea
to be in his mom's good books.

144
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,101
What does it feel like to like someone?

145
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,186
Well…

146
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,524
When he shows up,
everything around him becomes dark,

147
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,984
and he's the only thing that lights up.

148
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,363
Hmm, like the halo effect idols have?

149
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
Halo effect.

150
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,719
I didn't order this.

151
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,309
Heon.

152
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,688
I ordered it for you.

<i>-will compete for medals.</i>
-I'm nervous.

159
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,966
Me, too.

160
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,012
<i>A strong favorite, Woo Dae-sung,</i>
<i>is walking in now.</i>

161
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,474
<i>Woo Dae-sung won a gold medal last year</i>
<i>in the men's 100-meter freestyle.</i>

162
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,101
<i>He's on a roll.</i>

163
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,311
-Woo Dae-sung!
-<i>He's expected…</i>

164
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,563
-Woo Dae-sung, you're hot!
<i>-…to perform well</i>

165
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,856
<i>at today's event.</i>

166
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,107
Woo Dae-sung.

167
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
Milky skin, Woo Dae-sung!

168
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,700
Woo Dae-sung! Come in first!

169
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,452
He isn't like plain milk, though.

170
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,830
He's somewhere between banana milk
and chocolate milk.

171
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,956
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

172
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,751
-Don't hurt yourself.
-Get whatever medal you can!

173
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>Ready.</i>

174
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,547
<i>Set.</i>

175
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,264
Woo Dae-sung!

176
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,357
Chocolate milk skin!

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,068
-Woo Dae-sung!
-Woo Dae-sung!

178
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,959
Just a bit faster.

179
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,349
1ST: PARK MIN-WOO
2ND: WOO DAE-SUNG

180
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>Woo Dae-sung,</i>

181
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,649
you've always placed first.

182
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,611
How do you feel about missing the gold
and winning the silver medal?

183
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,409
-I'm sorry.
-Dae-sung, good job!

184
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,078
You're the best!

185
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
You did awesome!

186
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,168
You're hot!

187
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,719
Second place is still great.

188
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,081
Don't you want to be a national athlete?
Why haven't you stayed in shape?

189
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,959
And you said
you're happy with second place?

190
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:09,891
<i>Heon.</i>

191
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,479
<i>Geon isn't well.</i>
<i>I don't think we can make it to Korea.</i>

192
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>Can you hold the memorial service</i>
<i>on your own?</i>

193
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>I'll come to Korea next month</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

194
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,579
Dae-sung, great work.

195
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,289
Jin-hwan and Ha-young left

196
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,334
because they had to go to the academy
and a family dinner.

197
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,836
It's okay. You're here, Brother.

198
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,380
Thanks a lot for coming.

199
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,382
Don't mention it. We're friends.

200
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,134
I'll buy you dinner today.

201
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,053
What do you think about pork belly?

202
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,473
I'm sorry. I'd love to have pork belly,

203
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,766
but I have something to do.

204
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,559
Wait.

205
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,646
HOW IS IT GOING? I'LL BE THERE SOON!

206
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,816
I have to go now.

207
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,944
That's too bad. We can catch up next time.

208
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
Let's have pork belly when I place first.

209
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,448
Sorry. I have something
really important to do today.

210
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,493
Second place is super great, too.

211
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,829
I don't know why
people only care about the first place.

212
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,830
Thanks.

213
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,417
Give me that before you go.

214
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,377
This?

215
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,421
It says "Dae-sang", not "Dae-sung".

216
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,964
I'll make it properly next time.

217
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,215
I like Dae-sang better.

218
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,510
If you give me that, I'll give you this.

219
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,055
Gosh! No, thanks. That's too precious.

220
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,106
I'll upgrade that to a gold medal
when I win one.

221
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,315
All right?

222
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,571
<i>I'm fine. Don't worry.</i>

223
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,659
Okay. I'll get going.

224
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,703
-Okay.
-Sorry. See you in school.

225
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,003
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,034
Heon!

227
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,995
You haven't started, right?

228
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,330
What are you doing here?

229
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,332
What?

230
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,627
You prepared everything already?

231
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,754
I bought fruit.

232
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,130
It's okay. Go home.

233
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:50,593
Well, I didn't know
you'd get it ready so soon.

234
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,720
Your mom and Geon said
they'd come home after seven.

235
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,766
I'm really okay, so just go.

236
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,854
You're so mean.

237
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,023
Can't you just ask for help?

238
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,399
I don't need it.

239
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,339
I understand that Geon is sick,
but Heon is still a kid.

240
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,757
How can she leave him on his own?

241
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,760
Speaking of which,
I know she's busy with work,

242
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,762
but she shouldn't leave him alone
for this long.

243
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,098
She must have her reasons.

244
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,100
I'm just worried.

245
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,851
Wait.

246
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,273
Sol-i, bring this to Heon later.

247
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:50,278
Right. The intelligent Ms. Lee Chan-hui
bought this just for Heon.

248
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,780
Okay. I will.

249
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,707
Excuse me. Heon?

250
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,919
I guess you left the door open
because of the memorial service.

251
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,884
I'm here because my mom
asked me to give this to you.

252
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,348
Also, I'm really sorry
about earlier today.

253
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,603
I didn't know your mom wasn't coming.
