00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,247
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

3
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,499
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

4
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,711
What do I do?

5
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,434
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

6
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,231
Do you have something on your mind?
Why the glum face?

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,525
Did you skip your morning pooping hour?

8
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,112
Don't tell me you have
a bad case of constipation.

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,367
Why aren't you talking?
You're boring me, you know.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,037
Shin Sol-i was never the quiet type.

11
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,082
No way, it can't be!

12
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,669
Did you get into a lovers' quarrel
with Dae-sung?

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,462
I'm right, aren't I?

14
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,547
Good morning.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,259
What the hell? I guess I'm wrong.

16
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,972
I need to poop.

17
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,849
-Don't tell.
-See you.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,479
He's busy from early in the morning.

19
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,488
Oh, right. Hi.

20
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,967
You've been listless all day.

22
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,552
What's wrong? What's going on?

23
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,645
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,190
You have to keep it secret, okay?

25
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,650
No way.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,568
Was it Cha Heon?

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,238
That's what I thought, but it wasn't.

28
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,615
Who was it, then?

29
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Woo Dae-sung?

30
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,286
What should I do?

31
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,542
What else? Just go out with him.

32
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,211
-What?
-My friend.

33
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,380
Just think about it.

34
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,840
You never noticed
because you kept your eyes on Heon,

35
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,926
but Dae-sung is pretty handsome, too.

36
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,638
Let's be honest.
Dae-sung is sweet and handsome.

37
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,474
Also, what about the prize money
he wins at tournaments?

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,104
He could buy everything
from here to there.

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
No, he could buy the entire snack bar.

40
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,651
Sure, snack bars are nice.

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,239
The class starts soon. Hurry up.

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,456
But Heon's like a department store to me.

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,171
Heon,

44
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,049
can you lend a hand?

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,802
I need to bring the class notes
from the staff room.

46
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:46,977
Cha Heon,

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,772
I gave up the snack bar for you.

48
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,399
Dae-sung, you see…

49
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,617
The thing is…

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,579
What's going on? Just tell me.

51
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,503
The Game of Truth note

52
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,881
you wrote that day.

53
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,759
I saw it!

54
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,570
Oh, that?

55
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,532
That was just a joke.

56
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,492
Did you believe that?

57
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,869
What?

58
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,996
Who takes that game seriously?

59
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,915
Goodness.

60
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,836
Brother, you're something else.

61
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,837
Are you sure?

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,090
Of course.
Once a brother, always a brother.

63
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,095
Exactly. We're brothers!

64
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,058
You better watch out of con men.

65
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
You'll be in trouble.

66
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,897
Sorry about that.
I was worried for no reason.

67
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,501
Yes, Coach. Got it.

68
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,921
Coach is looking for me.

69
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,798
-I should go now.
-Sure.

70
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,550
Bye.

71
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,695
Hey, Heon.

72
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
Are you taking out the trash?

73
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,450
Yes.

74
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,207
-What is it?
-Where have you been?

75
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,167
Oh, I was with Dae-sung.

76
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,014
Don't stay out so late.

77
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,307
What?

78
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,694
Okay. I won't stay out late.

79
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,737
I'll always come home early!

80
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,830
MILK

81
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,711
<i>Exactly. We're brothers!</i>

82
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,546
<i>I was worried for no reason.</i>

83
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,187
-Did you do your homework?
-No, I'm going to copy yours.

84
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,487
Chocolate milk delivery.

85
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,658
<i>Don't want to lose you</i>

86
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,659
Ha-young.

87
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,994
Thanks.

88
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,834
Wang Se-hyeong.

89
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,759
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

90
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,401
I don't get this topic at all.

91
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,196
Of course, it's essential. Right?

92
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,075
Why else are we studying our butts off?
To go to university.

93
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,618
By the way,

94
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
a certain member of our group
seems out of place.

95
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,663
How annoying.

96
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,916
I like the lineup, though.

97
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,337
I'm glad we're in
the same group, too, Hui-ji.

98
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,216
She's the issue here.

99
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,011
Come on. Sol-i will do a good job.

100
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,474
Sol-i, how do you think
we should prepare this debate?

101
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,810
What? Me?

102
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,814
Come to think of it, you can relate
the most to the opposing side.

103
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,483
You're the one who's least likely
to graduate from university.

104
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,778
Well, I think…

105
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,908
You see… Well…

106
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,996
This is my first time preparing a debate.

107
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,707
Sol-i, have some confidence.

108
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,668
I'll help you out.

109
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,464
Okay. I'll make sure
to practice this weekend.

110
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,732
After all that running around,
my feet are begging for some air.

111
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm taking off my shoes.

112
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,200
Never mind. I'll just keep them on.
I think that's better.

113
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,161
What do you mean?

114
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,038
Nothing. Never mind.

115
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,960
Then just take them off.

116
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,803
No!

117
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,057
I don't have athlete's foot.

118
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,643
See? The other one is a normal sock.

119
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,729
I don't normally wear socks like this.

120
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,982
My mom matched one of mine with my dad's,

121
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,734
and I didn't have time to change.

122
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,527
Who asked?

123
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,322
Don't take it the wrong way, okay?

124
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,740
I don't have athlete's foot.

125
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,133
The weather's terrible today.

126
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
It could rain any second.

127
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,721
Let's go home before it does.

128
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,556
But it's sunny.

129
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,730
Heon, you believe me, right?

130
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,732
I don't have athlete's foot.

131
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,156
Hello.

132
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,076
-<i>Ghost Walk</i>, please.
-Sure.

133
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,413
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

134
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,831
Enjoy the movie.

135
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,339
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

136
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
I'd like a ticket
for the movie he's watching.

137
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,594
-I'm sorry, but--
-I'll explain.

138
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,473
He's actually my older brother.

139
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,185
All the hard studying
has been messing with his head,

140
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,355
so my mom asked me
to keep an eye on him today.

141
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,066
Got it. Which seat?

142
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,610
I'll sit a few rows behind him.

143
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,653
Sure.

144
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,197
-Here.
-Okay.

145
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,742
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

146
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,714
Why is this only money you have?

147
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,882
Right, Jin-hwan.

148
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,135
This isn't even close
to the amount from before.

149
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,637
You were so generous that day, remember?

150
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,473
Jin-hwan, as your best friend,
I'm disappointed.

151
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,435
I never gave you the money.
You took it from me.

152
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,854
What did he just say?

153
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,149
Do you even know
what kind of trouble you put me in?

154
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,944
Why should I give you my money?

155
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,864
Jin-hwan, keep it down, will you?

156
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,491
-Don't raise your voice.
-I guess we have no choice.

157
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,784
Hey.

158
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,995
Who are you?

159
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,205
What the hell?

160
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,707
-What?
-Who the hell are you?

161
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,916
Hold on.

162
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,169
Why are you bullying him?

163
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,254
Gosh, Jin-hwan,

164
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,506
-Is she your girlfriend?
-Wow, damn.

165
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,134
Jin-hwan, nice going.

166
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,302
Hey!

167
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,515
-Leave her alone.
-You've lost your mind, haven't you?

168
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

169
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,228
I said… I'm fine.

170
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,231
Look, being a girl doesn't give you
a free pass.

171
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,233
-What makes you so cheeky?
-The police.

172
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,278
-I already called them.
-"I called them."

173
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,988
-What a liar.
-So where are they?

174
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,156
-Officer?
-Where?

175
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,158
See? No one's around--

176
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,660
Are you guys all right?

177
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,578
You little…

178
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,750
Take that!

179
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,628
Run!

180
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,432
Jeong Jin-hwan, where did you go?

181
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,310
Hey, let's go that way.

182
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,728
You check over there.

183
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,106
I need to run again? Damn it.

184
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,865
God, that was scary as hell.

185
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,620
Hey.

186
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,331
Is this how you lost your money before?

187
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,500
Yes.

188
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,546
Those bastards.

189
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,301
Are you all prepared for the debate?

190
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,721
Well… Yes.

191
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,766
I prepared the best I could.

192
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,896
I mean, I…

193
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,274
Shin Sol-i, do better, will you?

194
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,027
If you speak like that in class later,
our team will be screwed.

195
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,489
Then, will you make up for my grades?

196
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,671
Many celebrities don't
go to university these days.

197
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,632
Right.

198
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,469
Not many athletes
graduate from university, either.

199
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,180
The same goes for entrepreneurs.

200
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,308
Right, I guess that's true.

201
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,449
According to the affirmative team,

202
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,493
the most basic tool for finding success

203
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,287
is a university diploma.

204
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,623
I believe the statement
to be contradictory.

205
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,376
I'd like to ask them in return

206
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,172
if everyone who's considered successful
actually has a degree.

207
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,591
AFFIRMATIVE

208
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,052
NEGATIVE

209
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,852
Me?

210
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,945
I'd like to give an example
by mentioning someone we all know.

211
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,199
It's Woo Dae-sung.

212
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,911
Me?

213
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,290
Dae-sung hasn't even
entered university yet,

214
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,002
but he's already an acknowledged swimmer

215
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,673
both domestically and internationally.

216
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,469
Just like Dae-sung,
many athletes and celebrities

217
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,721
didn't go to university after graduating.

218
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,141
I believe we all have
our own goals or dreams

219
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,270
that will bring us happiness or success.

220
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,440
One may want to be a chef.

221
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,192
Another may want to become a writer.

222
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,487
yet another may even
dream of becoming a singer.

223
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,323
Who are we to measure one's success

224
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,411
based solely on whether
they have a university diploma?

225
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,847
"Who are we to measure one's success

226
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,183
based solely on whether
they have a university diploma?

227
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,311
What you all think?"

228
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,438
I never said that!

229
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,649
Sol-i, how did you come up with that?

230
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,610
I'm amazed.

231
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,278
You can thank me later.

232
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,530
Nonsense. How did you help me?

233
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,658
"Yet another may even
dream of becoming a singer."

234
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,911
Who would that be? Me, of course.

235
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,789
You always talk the talk.

236
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,333
Then why weren't you able

237
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,668
to do so in front of
those money-stealing bullies

238
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,545
until Ha-young showed up?

239
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,672
-Hey, that's a secret!
-Who were they?

240
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,966
Let's go. I'll teach them a lesson.

241
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,426
I wasn't bullied.

242
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,803
Besides, they didn't take much.

243
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,347
How long has it been going on?

244
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,607
Back in seventh grade,

245
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,235
they locked me in a storage room

246
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,531
and forced me to sing a song.

247
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,910
I was so scared at the time.

248
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,954
-Without knowing--
-You wet yourself?

249
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
They had me wrapped around their fingers
since then.

250
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,548
I embarrass you, don't I?

251
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,967
Of course not.

252
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,220
When I first learned how to swim,

253
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,515
I wet myself too in the swimming pool.

254
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,146
I was an outcast in middle school.

255
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,284
When I was a kid,

256
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,037
I once drank plum wine and got wasted.

257
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,831
-What? No way.
-No way.

258
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,708
When? Where?

259
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,543
You don't need to know.

260
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,507
My dad once gave me athlete's foot.

261
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,759
No way. That's shocking.

262
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,136
Very shocking.

263
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,555
What? Isn't this the least shocking one?

264
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,266
-I don't think so.
-What?

265
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,102
But those toe socks from before--

266
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,439
That's not the case. I'm completely cured.

267
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,232
My feet are fungus-free now.

268
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,817
Ms. Shin Sol-i,

269
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,361
athlete's foot can recur anytime.

270
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,158
Jeong Jin-hwan, you…

271
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
Ha-young, do something!

272
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,328
Stop. That's enough, you guys.

273
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,665
-You jerk.
-Yes, you jerk.

274
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,292
Which socks are you wearing today?

275
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:56,255

Did you drink all that?
