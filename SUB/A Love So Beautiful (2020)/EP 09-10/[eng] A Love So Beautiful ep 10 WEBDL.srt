<i>You've waited for me without fretting</i>

3
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,253
<i>And entered my heart peacefully</i>

4
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,925
<i>You're lovely from head to toe</i>

5
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>I'm proud that you're my woman</i>

6
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,933
Jin-hwan.

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,603
What is it, Sol-i? You're scaring me.

8
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,148
My MP3 player battery's dead.

9
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,359
No, never. This is practically part of me.

10
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,529
You borrowed my book, too.
Are you trying to take everything from me?

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,661
Excuse me, Heon.

12
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,872
Heon. I made these over the weekend.

13
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,208
Here.

14
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,462
I made some cookies,
and I wanted to give you some.

15
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,173
Enjoy.

16
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,262
Please.

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,430
Hi, guys.

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,397
What's wrong?

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,317
My MP3 player battery's dead.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,568
I see.

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,530
-Here, use mine.
-What?

22
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,532
-Don't you need to listen to it?
-No.

23
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,618
Thanks so much.

24
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,634
Compound relative pronouns

25
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:18,096
are formed by adding "ever"
to relative pronouns. Do you remember?

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,222
-Yes.
-Yes.

27
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,016
<i>"Now I know one thing.</i>

28
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,186
<i>I'm still living,
even though I feel like I'm dying.</i>

29
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,855
<i>'I feel like I'm dying.
This isn't living.'</i>

30
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>A life that echoes these words
is still a life."</i>

31
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,570
Goodness. This is so sad.

32
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,697
Hey. Sol-i.

33
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,824
Wait. I only have few pages left.

34
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,702
What?

35
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,624
-Shin Sol-i.
-Yes.

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,334
Yes?

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,047
Hardly a day goes by
that you don't pay attention in class.

38
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,049
I'm sorry, ma'am.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,467
Give me that, too.

40
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,219
Pardon?

41
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,096
What else?

42
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,067
-You can't have them for a week.
-Wait, Ms. Moon.

43
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,861
You can take the book,

44
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,240
but could you please
give the MP3 player back?

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,408
No.

46
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,547
Sol-i.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,464
What?

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,135
"You can take the book, but could you
please give the MP3 player back?"

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,222
I can just pay the late fee for your book,

50
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,642
but he can't survive
without his MP3 player for a week.

51
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,269
Anyway, I'm really sorry, guys.

52
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,313
It's okay. I have another one at the pool.

53
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,401
I brought a lot of heat packs today.
Who needs them?

54
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,570
Me! Give me two.

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,824
Ha-young, don't catch a cold.
There's a flu going around.

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,326
-I'm okay.
-I'm worried about you.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,579
I heard it's a nasty flu.

58
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,914
You might have to be hospitalized
if you catch it.

59
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,168
I won't get to see you then.

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,503
Jeez, you're so annoying.

61
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,963
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

62
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:16,923
This one is warmer.

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,062
I think Heon is done eating.

64
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,107
Heon, wait for me.
Don't you need a heat pack?

65
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,201
"I wish to live.
I wish to live in Cheongsan.

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,497
I wish to eat wild grapes and hardy kiwis
as I live in Cheongsan."

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,540
This song has

68
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,920
a very stable structure of A-A-B-A.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,798
Su-jin, are you okay?

70
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,717
Hui-ji, you too?

71
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,011
Sir, she's been coughing
since the first period.

72
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
You should've told me sooner.

73
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,476
Let's go to the health office. Get up.

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,521
I'm sorry, guys. Do some self-study, okay?

75
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,897
-Yes, sir.
-My goodness.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,148
You should've told me.

77
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey, do you think they have the flu?

78
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,574
I saw the news yesterday,

79
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,285
and it said that you can die
from this year's flu.

80
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,789
Once someone catches it,
it spreads really quickly.

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,625
One out of ten will die from the flu.

82
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,794
How many of us will die then?

83
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,796
Three people?

84
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,006
Two already got the flu.
Who's the last one?

85
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,468
Stop lying, Se-hyeong.
People don't die from the flu.

86
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,220
They said it's serious this time.

87
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,306
Don't you watch the news?
Some people already died overseas.

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,724
Die?

89
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,984
Sol-i! Sol-i's next!

90
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,652
Sol-i. She's next.

91
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,910
A lot of vaccines have been developed.

92
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,913
If you get treated in time, you won't die.

93
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,499
No, my mom said you would.

94
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,838
Brother, are you okay?

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,798
You're not sick, are you?

96
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,675
No, I'm okay.

97
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:29,222
We should get treated in time, then.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,361
Darn it. Look at Sol-i.
She looks really sick.

99
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,573
You're right. She doesn't look well.

100
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,741
Ha-young.

101
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,161
Am I going to die? I won't, will I?

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,373
Sol-i, it'll be all right.
Nothing will happen.

103
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,877
You should go to the health office first.

104
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,420
Shall I go with you?

105
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,924
No, it's okay. I can go on my own.

106
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,585
Sir, where is Su-jin?

107
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,547
Su-jin's condition got worse,
so she went to the hospital.

108
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,300
Sol-i, you have a mild fever.

109
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,844
Do you have any other symptoms?

110
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,014
No. I just sneezed twice.

111
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,766
I'm totally fine, Mr. Lee.

112
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:00,438
So it can't be the flu, right?

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,233
Take some medicine and rest up first.

114
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,239
By the way, why do you have
dark circles under your eyes?

115
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,076
That's strange.

116
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,372
Take some rest first.

117
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,667
Okay.

118
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,778
It's nothing serious.

120
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,864
Yes. Don't worry.

121
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,033
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,829
I heard back from Su-jin.

123
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,622
She has the flu.

124
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,126
It's very contagious,
so why don't we send everyone home?

125
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,794
Let's do it right away.

126
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,088
Send all the students home.

127
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,424
Quarantine the two students

128
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,218
in the health office
until the others go home.

129
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,055
I'll report this
to the principal right now.

130
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,014
Okay.

131
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,683
All right. Move it.

132
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,604
I never thought
I'd thank Su-jin for anything.

133
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,523
No, I should thank the flu, not Su-jin.

134
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,983
Flu, thank you!

135
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,693
-Let's go to the internet cafe.
-Sure, let's go.

136
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,363
Will you go see Sol-i?

137
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,868
Heon, aren't you going to see Sol-i?

138
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,413
Make up your mind right now.

139
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,500
Let's go without him.

140
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,417
Come on.

141
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,711
Heon, why aren't you coming?

142
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,589
She'd rather see you than us!

143
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,300
Gosh.

144
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,800
-Brother.
-Sol-i.

145
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,136
-Sol-i.
-Guys.

146
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,889
Why are you here?

147
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,225
Because we're worried.
Are you okay, Brother?

148
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,102
-Are you okay?
-What did the nurse say?

149
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,147
I'm okay. I don't feel sick at all.

150
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,108
By the way, where's Heon?

151
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,530
Heon? He couldn't come

152
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,824
because Ms. Moon asked him
to do something.

153
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
I see.

154
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,249
Brother, you'll be able to go home soon,
so don't worry.

155
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,334
Okay. Thanks.

156
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,545
You should go home now.

157
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

158
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,465
-Bye.
-Thanks.

159
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,553
Bye.

160
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,834
<i>OUR HAPPY TIME</i>

161
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:11,981
Why are you here?

162
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,775
Well…

163
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,947
Could you give this to her?

164
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,247
To whom?

165
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,601
Heon asked me to give this to one of you.
Whose is this?

166
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,938
But that's Heon's.

167
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,857
Give it to me, sir.

168
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,151
I asked him to lend it to me.

169
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,820
Okay.

170
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,318
ON

171
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,962
This is Heon's voice.

172
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,675
I'm hearing things now.

173
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,387
Am I really sick?

174
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,933
Don't go anywhere else.
Go straight home, okay?

175
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,810
If you go somewhere else,

176
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,562
you'll get a scolding, okay?

177
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,314
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

178
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,525
Mr. Lee, when will Sol-i get to go home?

179
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,571
I'm still monitoring her.
You should go home first.

180
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,823
I'm worried about Sol-i.

181
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,621
When a space probe is out of order
in space,

182
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,749
do you know what the other probes
have to do?

183
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,834
They have to stand by.

184
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,879
So you should go home first.

185
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,179
He must be into space, too.

186
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,517
Ha-young, I think he caught the flu, too.

187
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,769
"Space"? "Probe"?

188
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,480
What was that? What was he talking about?

189
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,066
You don't need to know.

190
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>"Love is to endure anything

</i>-What's that?

194
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,997
What's he talking about?

195
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,209
That brat. I'll catch you.

198
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,011
from the dark back alleys,
the abandoned forests,

199
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,933
the valley of terror, the desert of truth,

200
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,229
and the arrogant, harsh rivers.

201
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,565

<i>-"'It's called the sea.'"</i>
-Goodness, Sol-i.

Hui-ji, you've gotten much better.

Sol-i, you don't have a fever anymore.

229

You can go home now.

Okay.

Is Su-jin okay?

232
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,330
Yes, she'll be fine if she takes medicine
and gets some rest.

Okay, thank you.

<i>-Heon.</i>

I think you should host a radio show.

240
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,965
No, you could be a singer.

241
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
I knew you had a great voice,

242
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,263
but it sounded really nice
through the speakers.

Sol-i.

253
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,929
I have something to tell you
about the flu.

254
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,810
Flu literally causes symptoms
which are much worse than a cold.

255
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,687
In other words,

256
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,564
it's like a severe cold.

257
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,901
Symptoms of the flu are just like a cold.

258
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,571
Usually, you get better
after several days.

259
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:02,076
And for young, healthy people,
it doesn't cause much problem.

260
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,957
Sorry. I didn't poop this morning.

261
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,588
You should record again.

262
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,553
Gosh. Sorry again.
