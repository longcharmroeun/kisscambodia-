DECEMBER, 2007, WINTER OF EIGHTEEN

3
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,842
Ha-young, are you cross-stitching?

4
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,803
I'm giving it to Mr. Lee
before winter break.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
It's Christmas Eve on that day.

6
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,974
What about you? What did you get?

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,022
Ta-da. I bought a card.

8
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,108
-Isn't it pretty?
-Will that be enough?

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,611
Your rival prepared something huge.

10
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,202
What's that? A muffler?

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,247
-I want to knit one too.
-Do you know how?

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,540
Don't you?

13
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,001
I was hoping you'd teach me.

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,753
What a headache.

15
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,466
Ha-young, it's Christmas soon.

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,218
Is there anything you'd like?

17
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,263
Like for instance, a star in the sky.

18
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,765
Why? Would you get it for me?

19
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,809
Should I? Do you want a star?

20
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,437
You and your nonsense.

21
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,441
Should I make you see stars?

22
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,651
As long as I'm next to you.

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,237
I lose.

24
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,240
-Sol-i, hurry up.
-Sure.

25
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,576
Wait for me!

26
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,208
Here.

27
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,252
I'm fine.

28
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,129
Put them on. I'm not cold.

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
Thanks.

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,014
What?

31
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,850
It's dangerous.

32
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,213
I wish it would snow this Christmas.
Don't you?

33
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,133
Sure.

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,187
Dad, you're the best!

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,022
Mr. Shin, I'm impressed.

36
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,066
Right? Isn't my dad awesome?

37
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,694
-Will I be able to do that?
-Of course.

38
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,905
You need to help me.

39
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,996
Goodness.

40
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,375
My daughter has a crush on a boy.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,753
No wonder she wanted to learn how to knit.

42
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,465
Who is he?
Which prick dared to take my little girl--

43
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,218
Stay put, will you?
You're driving me nuts.

44
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,303
We should ask Sol-i. Sol-i!

45
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,056
-Sol-i--
-Hey, stay still!

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,810
She hasn't written anything else.
Let's see how it goes.

47
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,521
Our daughter is old enough to marry now.

48
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,898
Seriously, Gi-heon?

49
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,567
Get a grip on yourself.

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,985
Your daughter's only--

51
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,696
Hey.

52
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,573
What are you guys up to?

53
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,287
Your father wants to sing at this hour.

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,580
You can't.

55
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,165
Get back to your studies.

56
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,916
Sure.

57
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,210
Honey, please.

58
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,342
Cut it out.

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,263
Goodness, Heon.

60
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,808
-Hello.
-Can we have a talk?

61
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,351
Sure.

62
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,858
There's something I'd like to ask.

63
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,860
How is Sol-i at school these days?

64
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,487
Sorry?

65
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,325
Is there a boy
she's particularly close to?

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,664
-Not really.
-Think about it.

67
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,918
Isn't there someone
she constantly hangs out with?

68
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
Not really.

69
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,509
Sol-i's here. Have fun at school then.

70
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,968
Sure. We'll get going.

71
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,315
What would Heon know?

72
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,609
He's probably too busy
studying all the time.

73
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,320
Who can it be?

74
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,741
You guys are so old-fashioned.

75
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,660
Knitting is so old-school.

76
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,912
Elementary kids wouldn't even do this.

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,622
Wang Se-hyeong, get lost.

78
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
-Give it back.
-Yes, ma'am.

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,835
You guys are so boring.

80
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,382
Ha-young.

81
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,636
What does this look like? A muffler?

82
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,637
Yes.

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,847
A doormat, actually.

84
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,101
Right?

85
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,687
I think I'm screwed.

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,522
I'll never get it right.

87
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,984
How about a wish bracelet?

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,403
A wish bracelet? What's that?

89
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,197
It's a bracelet made by braiding thread.

90
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,241
You just have to wear it.

91
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,411
The day it wears off and snaps
is the day your wish comes true.

92
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,040
Sounds nice, but is that easy to make?

93
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,418
Yes, super easy. Don't worry.

94
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,878
Great. What about you?

95
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,847
-It's so pretty!
-Isn't it?

96
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,906
TO MR. LEE

97
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,550
Se-hyeong, good luck.

98
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,887
She's here!

99
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,475
What? What now?

100
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,062
I knew it, Kang Ha-young.
Not that easy. I like that.

101
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,984
What is it? Just spit it out.

102
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,488
I'll give you a chance to be my girlfriend
this Christmas.

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,073
How's that?

104
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,825
Wang Se-hyeong, are you out of your mind?

105
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,080
Sure, you can play
hard to get at least once.

106
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,207
Being the man I am, I'll be generous.

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,708
You get three passes.

108
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,800
Kang Ha-young, be my girlfriend.

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,385
Hey.

110
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,595
Get lost.

111
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,473
Think carefully. This is your last chance.

112
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,768
I said, get lost. Am I insane?

113
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,520
I'll never say yes.

114
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,481
You're a funny one, Ha-young.

115
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,316
I thought I'd be generous.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,443
Just live on your own
and die old and lonely.

117
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,487
Who would like a wild girl like you?

118
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,322
I do.

119
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,290
Kang Ha-young, let's go.

120
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,299
Did I just lose against Jeong Jin-hwan?

121
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,429
So humiliating.

122
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,071
Hey.

123
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,491
That was loyal of you
to swoop in and help.

124
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,745
Of course. I'll always be by your side.

125
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,582
Anyway, thanks again.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,169
You should have thanked me later.

127
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,506
-Ta-da!
-What's this?

128
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,930
I told you I'd get you a star.

129
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,309
Hey, this is a scam.

130
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,311
They're not officially recognized.

131
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,190
Still, the name of this star
can't ever be changed.

132
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,859
This is the only star in space

133
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,236
that's named Kang Ha-young.

134
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,491
Okay. I appreciate it.

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,576
Thanks.

136
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,710
Cha Heon, this is for you.

137
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,344
Please. Don't accept it.

138
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,805
What's up?

139
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,687
All right.

140
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,487
What's the subject here?

141
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,282
-"Our group members," right?
-He accepted it. Damn it.

142
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,700
What about the object?

143
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,286
How's the bracelet coming along?

144
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,122
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.

145
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,290
Forget it. I won't give him anything.

146
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,503
Why not?

147
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
Mom!

148
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,605
Did you see a pink card in my room?

149
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,317
-What?
-Have you seen a pink card?

150
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,195
-Sol-i, who is that card for?
-Hey.

151
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,072
Just stay still.

152
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,786
Is this card--

153
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,708
-Wait. Why is it cold?
-It's chilly today.

154
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,419
Sol-i, who is that card for?

155
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,422
What do you mean?
I just bought it because it's pretty.

156
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,637
Hold on. Why does it smell like kimchi?

157
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,141
Dad, doesn't this smell sour to you?

158
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,768
I don't smell anything.

159
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,812
Anyway, what is that?

160
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,814
What?

161
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,445
Oh, this?

162
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,657
I was just testing a new pen I bought.

163
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,243
I told you.

164
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,287
Good night then, Sol-i.

165
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,872
You, too, Mom and Dad.

166
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,116
Cha Heon, this is for you.

167
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,380
Sol-i.

168
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,885
All right, guys.

169
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,389
The winter break
of your junior year is crucial,

170
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,599
so study hard next week

171
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,227
and see you again in the make-up class.

172
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,145
-Got it?
-Yes!

173
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,397
Great job.

174
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,946
Woo Dae-sung.

175
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,116
-What's up?
-Why isn't it snowing?

176
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,576
Snow? The snow that falls from the sky?

177
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,580
They said it'd snow.

178
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,207
-Who did?
-The weather forecast.

179
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,002
I've been calling them every day
for the past week.

180
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,505
We're supposed to have heavy snow by now,

181
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,716
but why is the sky clear?

182
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,676
Do you believe the weather forecast?

183
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,104
Okay, here I go.

184
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,399
-Come here.
-What?

185
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,484
-Take that!
-Take that!

186
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,030
Ha-young.

187
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,407
Get down now. My heart's about to drop.

188
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,998
Shin Sol-i, you go up there.

189
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,751
Why? I'm shorter than Ha-young.

190
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,004
-I can't reach up there.
-Right. That's why I'm telling you.

191
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,756
Your center of mass is lower than hers,

192
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,674
so you won't fall off. I promise.

193
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,800
Hurry up.

194
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
Get up.

195
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,723
-Over there.
-But…

196
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,579
Use this.

197
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,134
It's snowing!

198
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,761
-It's snowing!
-It's snowing!

199
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,388
-Really?
-No way.

200
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,848
-Wow!
-It's snowing!

201
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,644
What the hell? It's fake.

202
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,647
-It's still pretty though.
-Right?

203
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,634
Hey! Who did this?

204
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,845
It's one of you guys again, isn't it?

205
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,305
-We don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

206
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,559
Get out and sweep the ground.

207
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,269
Make it spotless, okay?

208
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,895
I don't think that's necessary.

209
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,814
What?

210
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,316
It's snowing for real now.

211
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,116
-My gosh.
-No way.

212
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,129
The weather forecast was right.

213
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,549
Weather forecasters, I apologize.

214
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,102
It's so pretty.

215
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,060
Come on, Ha-young.
I got this to walk you home.

216
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,532
You, too.

217
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,966
-It's snowing!
-Sweet!

218
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,843
-Where are you going?
-It's so pretty.

219
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
I don't want to wear this.

220
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,900
Just wear it. It's cold.

221
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,318
I don't want to.

222
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,656
Oh Hui-ji gave it to you.

223
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,661
My mom bought it for me.

224
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,960
Really?

225
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,505
No wonder!

226
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,092
It's pretty, it's super warm,
and it smells so good.

227
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,014
Heon, close your eyes.
I have a gift for you.

228
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,361
Open your eyes.

229
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,574
What's this?

230
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,035
A wish bracelet and a Christmas card.

231
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,662
Wear the bracelet every day.
Your wish will come true.

232
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,421
Are you sure it's a bracelet?
Isn't it a necklace?

233
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,092
It's not!
Just wrap it around your wrist twice.

234
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,510
Let me put it on for you.

235
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,723
Once.

236
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,351
Twice.

237
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,813
Gosh, it's so pretty!

238
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,029
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

239
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,661
Thanks.

240
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,087
Sure. Merry Christmas to you, too.

241
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,650
That's so pretty! I'm home.

242
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,861
This is new. Whose muffler is this?

243
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,698
Where's the muffler I got you?

244
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh, this?

245
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,828
-It's Heon's.
-Cha Heon's?

246
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
Cha Heon? Of course.

247
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,374
Are you hungry I'll get you a snack.

248
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,458
Sure.

249
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,170
-Dad.
-Yes?

250
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,930
Goodness, my daughter…

251
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,767
<i>To my dad, Shin Gi-heon.</i>

252
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,603
<i>Dad, I love you.</i>

253
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,815
No way. It was for me.

254
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,317
The "honey" was me. "Gi-heon."

255
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,486
Unbelievable.

256
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,405
Goodness.

257

-How is Sol-i at school these days?
-Sorry?

259
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,622
Is there a boy
she's particularly close to?

260
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,292
<i>Probably me.</i>

261
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
Please think long and hard.

262
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,840
Isn't there someone
she constantly hangs out with?

263
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,384
<i>That would be me.</i>

264
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,475
Sol-i's here. Have fun at school then.

265
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,976
Sure. We'll get going.

266
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,197
What were you and Mom talking about?

267
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,826
Nothing. We talked about the weather.

268
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:27,912
I see.

269
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,144
<i>I'm not following you.</i>

270
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,479
<i>I know. Who cares?</i>

271
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,356
What are you doing here?

272
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,025
-I thought you were waiting for me.
-Since when?

273
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,112
<i>I must be out of my mind.</i>

274
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,906
<i>Then, I'll sit next to her.</i>

275
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,992
<i>-How did you get here?
-All I did was follow you.</i>

276
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,118
<i>And I ended up here.</i>

277
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,328
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

278
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,373
<i>I have to go first,
so I can't walk you home. I'm sorry.</i>

279
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,876
<i>Heon. Meet me at the trail over there
in five minutes.</i>

280
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,797
<i>Everything looks so romantic.</i>

281
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,257
I prepared this for you.

282
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
To hell with it. Sol-i, be my girlfriend.
