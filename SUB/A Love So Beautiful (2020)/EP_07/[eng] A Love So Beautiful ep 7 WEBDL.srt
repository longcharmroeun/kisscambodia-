00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,581
MARCH 2007, SPRING OF EIGHTEEN

3
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,666
Come on.

4
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,793
Hey, guys.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,087
-Se-hyeong, why are you here?
-Are you in this class too?

6
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,005
Are you guys stalking me?

7
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,549
Am I still in class 1-7 or what?

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,260
I'm sick of it.

9
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,304
I'm more shocked
that you're in the natural sciences class.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,682
Don't you suck at math?

11
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,768
Su-jin, don't be mean.
We're all friends here.

12
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,987
No, you can't sit here. The seat's taken.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
By whom? You?

14
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,409
No, not me, but--

15
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,119
Then step aside.

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,829
This seat gets a lot of sunlight.

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,331
It'll make me look super handsome.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,875
The sun has nothing to do with it.

19
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,086
It's because Heon, who sat here, is hot.

20
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,880
Your dull face doesn't stand a chance.

21
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,340
"Dull"?

22
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,259
Hey, Heon!

23
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,728
Good morning.

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,606
That hurt, Ha-young.

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,485
Oh, Sol-i. My loyal friend saved my seat.

26
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,696
Guys, the bell just rang. Let's sit down.

27
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,991
Why is she still acting
like the class leader?

28
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,577
I know. Why did we have
to be in the same class again?

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
-Hi, guys!
-Hi, Dae-sung.

30
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,247
-Gosh.
-Hi.

31
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,088
Greetings, everyone!

32
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,218
It turns out that I'll be
your homeroom teacher.

33
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,890
But majoring in natural sciences
doesn't mean you can neglect Korean.

34
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,224
-Got it!
-Got it!

35
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's try our best this year!

36
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,527
CARL SAGAN

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,501
You must love flowers.

38
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,211
It's about the universe.

39
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,091
How can a book title be so pretty
like you, Ha-young?

40
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,967
You're distracting me. Go away.

41
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,678
No, this is distracting you
from seeing me,

42
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,389
so take this away.

43
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,349
Hey.

44
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,476
-Give it back!
-I won't.

45
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,561
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

46
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,438
Hello, Mr. Lee.

47
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,483
Hey, Ha-young. Is your leg okay?

48
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,318
Yes, of course!

49
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,570
Be careful, and don't run too much.

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,280
I won't.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,455
Ha-young, are you done?

52
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,541
Then, I'll get going again.

53
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,626
Catch me if you can!

54
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,878
What is that idiot saying?

55
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,047
Hey.

56
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,343
Don't run.

57
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,597
She's charismatic as hell.

58
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,433
Ha-young!

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,441
Ta-da!

60
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,068
Mr. Song Hae's show! "<i>Korea…</i>"

61
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,528
-"<i>Sings</i>!"
-"<i>Sings</i>!"

62
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,495
Wait. Are you going to apply?

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,622
Yes, it's this Saturday.
Come with me, guys.

64
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,166
I'll give you the chance to support me.

65
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,834
Count me out. It's too far away.

66
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,461
But Ha-young…

67
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,213
The show hasn't come
to Gyeonggi Province in a while.

68
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,299
Besides, Osan isn't that far away.

69
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
It only takes an hour by bus.

70
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,178
Really? It's that close?

71
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,599
Yes, although we'll have to transfer
three times.

72
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,102
I'll showcase my hidden talent
and become a superstar.

73
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,563
Agencies will be after me
to make me their trainee.

74
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,732
Jin-hwan, you have a big dream.

75
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,359
That's good. The bigger, the better.

76
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,696
Your comment is irrelevant.
You're a swimmer.

77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,407
You guys will come with me, right?

78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,329
Count me in. It will be fun.

79
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,955
Shin!

80
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,417
Did you even pass the preliminary round?

81
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,461
No.

82
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,555
-When is it?
-This Saturday.

83
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,140
-Saturday?
-Okay…

84
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,101
-Seriously?
-Can you please put that down?

85
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,728
You always wield it as a weapon.

86
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,396
Mom, this Saturday--

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,191
You, get the money back tomorrow.

88
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,235
If you don't, you're dead meat!

89
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,948
The thing is, Ji-sun left for Macau
on a business trip today--

90
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,075
Wait, the Gye Ji-sun I know of?

91
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,911
Hey, Shin Gi-heon! You…

92
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,792
What the hell?

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,628
Did you just throw <i>jokbal</i>
into my handsome face?

94
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,922
I don't want to talk to you, so leave.

95
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,298
Get out right now!

96
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,968
Why must I be ashamed
of lending someone my money?

97
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,554
How is that yours?
I gave you that pocket money.

98
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,222
I can no longer

99
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,350
live like this anymore!

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,645
Dad?

101
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,025
Fine, I can't stand it, either!

102
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,487
Mom?

103
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,078
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood
to hear you singing.

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,164
I need all of you here to stay motivated,
so sit tight.

105
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,340
Hello?

106
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,303
Yes, this is number 178, Jeong Jin-hwan!

107
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,723
Should I start singing? Yes, sir!

108
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,154
<i>Excuse me. Start from the refrain.</i>

109
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,531
The refrain? Got it, sir.

110
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,533
I'll start over then.

111
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>It's love, it's love</i>

112
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,292
<i>Even if I erase it, it's still love</i>

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,129
<i>I try to let go of you</i>

114
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,591
<i>But you're the only one living in my heart</i>

115
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,303
<i>Only you, only you</i>

116
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,057
<i>You're the one I yearn and long for</i>

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,894
<i>I take out a photo of you</i>

118
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,899
<i>And gaze at it as I fall asleep</i>

119
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,485
<i>You made the first cut.</i>

120
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,493
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Have a good day.

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,164
Yes. I made it!

122
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,085
Guys! I'll be making my debut.

123
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,171
Do you have to go to Osan
for the second round, though?

124
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,214
Of course.

125
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,926
Ha-young, I'll promise
to say your name out loud on TV.

126
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,053
You'll all come with me, right?

127
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,932
Well, I can't say for sure.

128
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,810
If my Brother can't say for sure,

129
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,812
then neither can I.

130
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,273
Come on, Sol-i.
You have to come over. What's wrong?

131
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,529
I'm home.

132
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,125
<i>I'm going to another city.</i>

133
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,544
<i>Don't wait up for me, and go to bed.</i>

134
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,983
What's up?

135
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,570
Heon.

136
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,036
What's wrong?

137
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,831
Heon, what should I do?

138
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
My parents had an argument,

139
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,670
and my dad hasn't been home for two days.

140
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,467
I tried calling him, but his phone's off.

141
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,928
And my mom isn't home today, either.

142
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,476
What if my parents get a divorce?

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,686
What do I do?

144
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,777
Hey.

145
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,828
Okay.

146
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,138
That sleeve turned wet.

147
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,494
<i>I'm sure it's nothing serious.
Don't worry.</i>

148
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,122
WRITE MESSAGE
SHIN SOL-I

149
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,873
SEND

150
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,959
SEND TEXT MESSAGE?
1. YES, 2. NO

151
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,216
Heon!

152
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,384
SEND MESSAGE

153
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,179
Mom told me to collect laundry.

154
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,101
Over there. Take them.

155
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,487
By the way, why are the sleeves wet?

156
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,325
A neighborhood dog licked it.

157
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,202
There's a dog in our neighborhood?

158
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,872
I don't think I've seen one. Is it cute?

159
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,711
Yes, it is. But…

160
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,755
it's a little loud.

161
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,758
Take me with you
when you see it next time.

162
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,636
Sure.

163
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,310
Sol-i! Sol?

164
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,021
Sol-i.

165
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,607
Dad!

166
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,569
Where have you been?
I was worried about you!

167
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,154
Wait, is this a dream?

168
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,823
It's not.

169
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,533
You should get up if it is a dream.

170
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,410
Mom!

171
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,745
Did you go with Dad?

172
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,248
Yes, we went to Pohang
to look into a store to branch out.

173
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:52,170
So, does this mean the two of you made up?

174
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,506
Why would we even need to make up?

175
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,801
Look. No husband and wife
love each other as much as we do.

176
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,929
-Honey…
-Stop that.

177
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,889
Go have some king crabs.

178
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,266
I know how much you guys love king crabs.

179
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,310
Hurry up, all right?

180
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,562
King crabs. I love them!

181
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,480
Mom!

182
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,205

<i>Becoming the President, my dad's favorite</i>

<i>A friend of mine shared that dream…</i>

Thank you for coming. Next.

191
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,448
I have another song prepared.
Please give me another chance.

Damn it.

195
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,715
The judges have no eye for talent.

196
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
How can they disqualify a genius like me?

197
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,095
Cheer up. You can try again
when they come to Suwon.

198
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,098
He's right.
Just think of it as our little picnic.

199
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,851
Since we're here,
why don't we spend the night here?

200
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,271
Hey, is it because you want
to spend some time with Heon?

201
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,357
Come on. It will be fun.

202
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,652
Sounds good.
Let's have some fun while we're here.

203
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,739
I can't. My mom will be worried.

204
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,908
Comeo n, Ha-young.
We rarely get a chance like this.

205
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,577
Then, let's vote on it.

206
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,496
-I'm in.
-Me too.

207
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,789
Me three.

208
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,884
Let's find a place to sleep first.

209
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,096
Shall we go over there?

210
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,808
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

211
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,810
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

212
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,231
Hold on. Shouldn't we call home first?

213
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,776
Right, let's do that.

214
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,322
-Mom.
-Hey, Mom.

215
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,948
I'm spending the night at Sol-i's.

216
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,035
Ha-young offered to tutor me today
at her place.

217
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,787
-Put her on?
-Put her on?

218
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,790
-Hi.
-Hi, Mother.

219
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,249
We won't stay up too late.

220
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,876
We'll study for a few more hours.

221
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294
Don't worry.

222
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,129
Sure, good night.

223
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,342
-Hey, Mom.
-Mom, it's me. Good night.

224
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,678
Nice!

225
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,097
Hello?

226
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,391
Mom, I'll sleep over
at my friend's place today!

227
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,436
Please.

228
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,854
Just this once.

229
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,824
Hello, ma'am.
I'm Jin-hwan's classmate, Cha Heon.

230
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,618
Right.

231
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes, thank you. Sure.

232
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,083
Are we good?

233
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,261
HEAD COACH

234
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,432
-Hello?
-<i>Woo Dae-sung!</i>

235
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,518
<i>Why did you skip training today,
and where are you?</i>

236
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm at a friend's house.

237
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,526
<i>What? Then put that friend's father
on the phone!</i>

238
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,112
Take it.

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,414
Yes,

240
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm Jin-hwan's father.

241
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,002
<i>Who are you trying to fool?</i>

242
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,628
<i>Put your father on!</i>

243
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,299
What the…

244
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,926
Sorry.

245
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,304
Don't answer your phone tonight.
That's better.

246
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,393
Then I'll be dead once I get back.

247
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,897
Thanks.

248
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,901
Wow, that's a lot of stars.

249
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,445
I know. They're really pretty.

250
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,781
I've kept my nose
in my textbooks for so long,

251
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,950
I didn't know how pretty the sky is.

252
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,952
Hey, Jin-hwan.

253
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,415
When did you bury your nose in your books?
You always dozed off in class.

254
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,752
Can't you shut it
when I'm trying to be sentimental?

255
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,670
Be quiet, both of you.

256
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,882
Those stars may all look the same,

257
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,093
but some are planets,
while others are satellites.

258
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,597
I wonder if <i>Rosetta</i> and <i>Philae</i>
are up there too.

259
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,558
<i>Rosetta</i> and <i>Philae</i>? What are they?

260
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:01,812
In 2004, the European Space Agency
launched a space probe named <i>Rosetta</i>

261
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,150
along with a robotic lander called <i>Philae</i>.

262
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
Guys, are you listening to me?

263
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,120
Anyway, <i>Philae</i> landed safely,

264
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,498
but lost communication with <i>Rosetta</i>.

265
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,627
A shooting star! Guys, make a wish!

266
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,672
A shooting star? Wait, my wish.

267
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,842
Who was I talking to?

268
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,516
Don't you have a wish? Come on.

269
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,351
Meteors are just stone or dust.

270
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,105
They have no power to grant wishes.

271
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,288
Is everything okay with your parents now?

272
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,622
Oh, yes.

273
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,001
Their love for each other
helped them make up quickly.

274
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,836
I see. That's a relief.

275
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,507
By the way, thanks for listening to me.

276
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,053
Wait, Heon, did you not make a wish?

277
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,933
I didn't. What did you wish for?

278
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:21,934
Me?

279
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
I wished…

280
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,732
for you to like me.

281
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,569
But I took it back.

282
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,699
-Why?
-What do you mean, "Why?"

283
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,326
It's too heartbreaking

284
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,165
My love for someone is growing
when he doesn't love me back.

285
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,127
So I'd rather not wish
for any reciprocation.

286
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,296
That way, I can keep crushing on you.

287
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,007
Anyway, Heon,

288
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,386
someday in the future,
if I ever get angry with you

289
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,640
and say, "Heon, I'm going to give up
on liking you."

290
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,642
Even if I say something like that,

291
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,269
don't say anything back.

292
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,270
What?

293
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,565
Because I won't mean it. All right?

294
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,786
What? The Game of Truth at this hour?

295
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,747
Come on, it'll be fun. Write yours down.

296
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,288
<i>I want</i> Rosetta <i>and</i> Philae <i> to be happy.</i>

298
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,587

299
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,142
You must keep these secrets.
Don't tell anyone.

300
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,101
Okay?

You were right. It's super pretty.

There's no echo.

Let's still go for it. Who's next?

306

Is it me?

307
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,028

Okay, your turn.

311
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,800
I wish Heon would say something!

312
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,394
Go, Park Ji-sung!

313
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,650
That's new. He really spoke up.

314
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,863
Heon, are you sure you're all right?

315
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,707
This is awesome!

316
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,085
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

317
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,212
Awesome!

318

Guys, I like Ha-young the most!

319
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,155
What's the secret you wrote down that day?

Sol-i, hi.

322
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,202
Do you have plans tomorrow?

323
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,496

<i>Where are you? I'll be there.</i>

325
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,835
<i>-The secret you wrote down.
-That's supposed to stay secret.</i>

326
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,587
<i>So it's not a lie, is it?</i>

327
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,796
It's all thanks to her.

328
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,716
<i>Dae-sung, are you going public
with your girlfriend?</i>

329
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,134
<i>There. So stop following me.</i>

330
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,595
I won't be there on Saturday either,
so don't wait for me.
