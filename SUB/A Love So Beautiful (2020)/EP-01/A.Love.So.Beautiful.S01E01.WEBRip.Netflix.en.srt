1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,872
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL WELCOMES
THE NEW CLASS OF 2006

2
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,062
Hey, Heon.

3
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,690
We're at the same school again
and in the same class!

4
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,449
One might say
that fate brought us together.

5
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,875
The thing is…

6
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,377
What is it?

7
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,840
I like you.

8
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,843
I don't like you.

9
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,770
Then, I'll figure out a way.

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,211
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

11
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,129
ERADICATE BULLYING!

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:14,050
SUMMER 2020, THE PRESENT

13
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,608
Sol-i!

14
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,403
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,489
-What?
-We're late for class.

16
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Run to the classroom!

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,619
Hurry!

18
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,460
My name is Shin Sol-i.

19
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,547
What meant the most to 17-year-old me…

20
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,979
The most important thing to me right now…

21
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,315
is him.

22
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,282
SPRING 2006

23
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,034
Heon, let's go together.

24
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,286
No.

25
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,628
It feels like I've always
followed Cha Heon around.

26
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,386
Cha Heon!

27
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,893
Heon!

28
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,281
-Shin Sol-i.
-Sorry.

29
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,620
No matter what mistakes I make,
Heon never gets angry at me.

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,165
The only problem is

31
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,585
my legs are extremely short
while his are extremely long,

32
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,504
so I always lag behind him.

33
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,186
However, it's more than all right.

34
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,024
Because I believe
he's waiting for me to catch up.

35
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,238
There's a man

36
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,616
A man who loves you dearly

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,787
There's a man

38
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,456
One who can't confess his love

39
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,377
Jin-hwan, this is the 121st time
you've sung that song today.

40
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,295
No way.

41
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,963
That's all?

42
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,300
I should keep going then
since practice makes perfect.

43
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,097
There's a man

44
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,308
A man who loves you dearly

45
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,352
That's not singing, Jin-hwan.
You're just being annoyingly loud.

46
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,146
You'll make us all go deaf.

47
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,066
Sol-i, I'm hurt.

48
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,570
How could you not recognize
the true talent of this future superstar?

49
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,489
Maybe I should clean your ears.

50
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,993
I'll collect the math homework.

51
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,039
Here.

52
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,249
Here.

53
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,169
Wait. Just a second.

54
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,839
Sol-i, you're copying his again?

55
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,060
This week's math homework
was super easy. Right, Su-jin?

56
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
Whatever.

57
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,525
Mi-nyeo, wasn't the math homework
super easy?

58
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,402
The answers just popped out.

59
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,237
-Really?
-Yes.

60
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,077
SHIN SOL-I, 35

61
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,621
I'm sure you know why you're here.

62
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,709
Getting a good score is important,

63
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
but so is trying your best.

64
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,131
There were many questions
you didn't even bother answering.

65
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,719
Right.

66
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,689
Let's cut school and go singing.

68
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,697
Heon, are you free right now?

69
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,698
What is it?

70
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,953
Look at you, Hui-ji.
Are you interested in him?

71
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,080
You can fool the Devil, but not me.

72
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,331
You like him, don't you?

73
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,416
Is our class getting an official couple?

74
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,127
Finally?

75
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,838
I didn't understand
the math formula we learned today.

76
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,881
Could you explain it to me?

77
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,800
Sure.

78
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,141
Jin-hwan.

79
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,726
Between Hui-ji and me,
who has a smaller face?

80
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,856
Seriously? Of course, it's Hui-ji.

81
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,943
It wasn't even worth asking.

82
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,528
Even at a glance…

83
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,490
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

84
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,452
Nine?
Her head-to-height ratio is one to nine.

85
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,787
You don't stand a chance.

86
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,840
I made this myself.

87
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,887
You made this yourself?

88
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,598
I've never met someone quite like you.

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,394
Gosh. This is nothing.
You don't need to be so moved.

90
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,941
Sol-i, out of all the women I know,
you're the best.

91
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,862
The size of your face
isn't a deal-breaker for me.

92
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,863
Written by Hwang Jin-i.

93
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,784
"I will cut out the middle
of this long winter night,

94
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,745
coil it up in a blanket
warm as a spring breeze.

95
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,081
The night my beloved comes

96
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
I will slowly unwind it."

97
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
This poem by Hwang Jin-i

98
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,464
depicts how one deeply yearns
for their loved one.

99
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,176
Today we would call it a love letter.

100
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,388
I know this
since I've received a lot of them myself…

101
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,517
Okay, fine. I've written a lot, all right?

102
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,062
What matters the most is
how sincere the writer is.

103
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,690
That is why a love letter
written from the heart

104
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,025
can win someone over.

105
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,694
That's what you should remember.

106
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,571
Let's read the poem once again.

107
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,198
"I will cut out the middle
of this long winter night…"

108
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,450
A LOVE LETTER WRITTEN FROM THE HEART!

109
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,036
"…coil it up in a blanket
warm as a spring breeze.

110
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
The night my beloved comes…"

111
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,376
HI, MY DARLING, I'M SHIN SOL-I

112
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,589
What are you writing?

113
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,215
Darn it…

114
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,466
Mind your business.

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,510
Are you writing a love letter?

116
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,388
Consider yourself lucky.

117
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,765
Why? What do you mean?

118
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,393
Just like Hong Sung-dae
wrote a book on mastering math,

119
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,062
I can tutor you in mastering love letters.

120
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,856
You?

121
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,649
Back in middle school,

122
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,235
-a thousand love letters--
-You got 1,000 letters?

123
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,195
-Really?
-You idiot.

124
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,366
Don't you know who Hong Sung-dae is?
He wrote The Art of Mathematics.

125
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,746
I've written so many,
I'm the Hong Sung-dae of love letters!

126
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,458
That is just as impressive.

127
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,793
And I'm stuck on my first one.

128
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,171
Let me see.

129
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,938
You want me to deliver these?

130
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,441
I couldn't just keep
receiving the letters,

131
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,485
so I wrote some back to be polite.

132
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,070
They're my replies.

133
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,781
So what will it be? Want me to tutor you?

134
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,532
Yes. Gosh--

135
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,950
-Turn it off.
-Right.

136
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,954
What are you doing?

137
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,123
-Hold on. I'm sorry.
-Turn it off.

138
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,083
Done.

139
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,000
Teach me how to write it.

140
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,880
For the first line,

141
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,466
I'll write "Hi, Heon." What do you think?

142
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,720
That's so boring and tacky.

143
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,971
Sol-i, come on.

144
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,309
You need to start it off with a bang.

145
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,521
-Got it.
-Have some courage

146
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,732
-and come to me.
-"Come to me…"

147
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,026
-You could
-"You could…"

148
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,361
have me to yourself.

149
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,864
Isn't that a bit too forward?

150
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,410
It's all about the push and pull.

151
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,539
-Come to me.
-"Come to me."

152
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,874
-It's okay
-"It's okay"

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,168
-to
-"to…"

154
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,588
hold me now.

155
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,800
Jin-hwan.

156
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,885
Yes?

157
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,721
You're a genius!

158
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,598
That's amazing.

159
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,144
Like I said, I'm experienced.

160
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,772
Hey, Cha Heon
I fell for you at first sight

161
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,066
From head to toe, you are perfect

162
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,734
You're totally my type

163
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,778
Go steady with me

164
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,197
I won't take no for an answer

165
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,407
No way

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,576
If you say no to me

167
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,203
Wait, what if he says no?

168
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,414
No, that can't happen.

169
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,296
If you say no, I'll break your leg
And chew on the bone!

170
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,845
You'll chew on the bone?
That's kind of scary.

171
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,722
Who knew this school was so scary?

172
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,558
Must one be ready to offer up a leg?

173
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,521
That's right. This school is the scariest

174
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,647
and so am I.

175
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,400
So stop eavesdropping and go away.

176
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,237
This prospective rapper looks so fierce.

177
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,617
Okay. I'll consider you
a brother from now on.

178
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,037
Just so you know, I wasn't eavesdropping.

179
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,789
Anyone around here could hear you.

180
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,392
Have some courage and come to me.

181
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,311
You could have me to yourself.

182
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,565
My gosh, Jin-hwan.
"You could have me to yourself"?

183
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,860
But we're still only in high school!

184
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,111
Let me see.

185
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,493
Shin Sol-i, write the sentence
Ha-young just read.

186
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,287
Sol-i!

187
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,081
Yes, ma'am?

188
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,041
-Come on out.
-Pardon?

189
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,502
This one.

190
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,934
ALIGNMENT AND SPEECH

191
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,297
-Who's he?
-Beats me.

192
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,632
-He's super handsome.
-Oh, I know.

193
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,927
It's that dude. The transfer student
who went to training camp.

194
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,013
-Wow.
-Look how handsome he is!

195
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
Quiet, everyone.

196
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,727
Dae-sung,
why don't you introduce yourself?

197
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,236
Sorry for the belated introduction.

198
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,822
I'm Woo Dae-sung, a student swimmer.

199
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,990
Nice to meet everyone.

200
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,750
You can both take a seat.

201
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,604
We're classmates.

202
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,527
Look. Saved by my t-shirt, right?

203
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
Right, I guess.

204
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,785
Do you two know each other?

205
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,754
This is for you.

206
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,049
It's from Jeong Jin-hwan in class 1-7.

207
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,343
Oh, I see.

208
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,929
Let's take a look.

209
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,098
What are you doing?

210
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,394
No way. Who knew handwritten letters
were still a thing?

211
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,770
Give it back.

212
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,815
"Jeong Jin-hwan, freshman year."

213
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,484
"There's a man.
A man who loves you dearly."

214
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,987
I'm already barfing.

215
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,072
Who wrote this? I need to see his face.

216
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,532
Give it back!

217
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,742
-Give it back!
-Tell me who it is.

218
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,369
-Let's go.
-But…

219
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,496
What's the rush? Let's read a little more.

220
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,125
"At a distance where you can reach me."

221
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,585
Guys, you won't believe this!

222
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,213
Sol-i and Jin-hwan
got into it with some seniors.

223
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,840
-There's a fight?
-Come on!

224
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,426
Where? Wait for me!

225
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
Are you scared?

226
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,557
Do we scare you?

227
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,684
-What's going on?
-Who the hell are you?

228
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,436
I'm their classmate.

229
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,439
And that wasn't for you to see.

230
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,649
Who says I can't?

231
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,736
Anyone decent.
Try putting yourself in his shoes.

232
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,362
Wouldn't you feel violated too?

233
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,407
Feel violated?

234
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,082
Come on. Is this really necessary?

235
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,208
Use your words instead.

236
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,419
Let go while I'm still asking nicely.

237
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,423
-Let go!
-Damn prick.

238
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
It's Mr. Cho.

239
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,935
You brats, stop right there.

240
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,438
Let's go.

241
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,690
Stop right there. Stop, you brats!

242
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,861
Come back here!

243
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,522
Why are you fooling around
when you're supposed to study?

244
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,689
Stand up.

245
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,193
What the hell is this?

246
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,986
Unbelievable.

247
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,284
"I'm sorry

248
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,747
for being crazy in love with you
when I'm not worthy."

249
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,543
Jeez. That's the sound
of a lovesick heart, isn't it?

250
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,045
Mr. Cho.

251
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,048
Why are you still here?
You should be training.

252
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,300
Get going.

253
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,720
"I wait for you.

254
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,931
Despite not being worthy,

255
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,268
I still pine for you.

256
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,312
I wander around the world--"

257
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,486
What is it this time?

258
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,573
It's not against school rules
to write love letters in class.

259
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,827
You're violating her human rights.

260
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,245
What did you just say?

261
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,998
According to the Student Rights Act 2-4,

262
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,458
students must be treated
with respect and dignity--

263
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,002
Shut it, will you?

264
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,755
Being top of the class
doesn't get you a free pass.

265
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,132
Cheeky brat.

266
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,092
Stand in the back.

267
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,803
Right now!

268
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,018
You little brat.

269
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,024
Unbelievable.

270
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,443
So where was I?

271
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,655
"I wander around the world

272
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,075
and search with my eyes wide open

273
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,745
only to realize that you are irreplaceable

274
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,414
which makes me want you even more.

275
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,417
-Give--"
-Give me your love

276
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,046
Don't bring tears to my eyes

277
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,132
These words

278
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,845
Can be said more easily than breathing

279
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,057
-Yet I can't say them confidently
-Yet I can't say them confidently

280
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,644
-All I do is hide
-All I do is hide

281
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:34,274
-Like a coward
-Like a coward

282
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,151
Quiet, you brats.

283
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,778
My love

284
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,697
-Growing little by little
-Growing little by little

285
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,324
What the hell?

286
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,201
-Once in a while
-Quiet!

287
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,956
-Seeps out before I realize it
-Seeps out before I realize it

288
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,707
-Like a lost child
-You two.

289
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,252
Are you out of your minds? Get back!

290
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,795
You kids…

291
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,672
What the hell?

292
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,215
Get back here!

293
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,180
WRITTEN APOLOGY

294
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,644
Guys, have a good one then.

295
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,116
"Abusing the authority as a teacher
and reading a personal letter of a student

296
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,869
was not only a violation
of the student's civil rights

297
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,122
but was also highly inappropriate."

298
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,459
This isn't how you write an apology.

299
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,503
You don't sound apologetic at all.

300
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,840
This is my specialty, so let me help you.

301
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,264
I just wanted to say, Ha-young,

302
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,559
that you were incredible earlier today.

303
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,355
Why did you let him walk over you?
You should've punched the guy.

304
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,232
She's right.

305
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,736
Anyway, Mr. Jeong Jin-hwan,
the so-called master of love letters.

306
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,946
What you had me write were lyrics!

307
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,117
I'm sorry. To make it up to you,
karaoke's on me.

308
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,577
-Are you all in?
-No.

309
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,995
-I'm busy.
-Same here.

310
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,834
Me, too. I take my cue from my brother.

311
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,921
NO TALKING

312
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,929
Oh, no. Heon probably
went to school already.

313
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,110
-Aren't you coming?
-What? Right.

314
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,945
Of course. I'm coming.

315
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,121
Why do you keep smiling?

316
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,042
Because I'm so thrilled
to go to school with you.

317
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,144
Although he never
received a love letter from me,

318
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,356
I felt like he realized my feelings.

319
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,567
Heon, this is for you.

320
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,974
What do you want others to do for you
when you're sad?

321
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,186
-Can't I come with you?
-Don't follow me.

322
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,272
Wouldn't it mean the most
to just keep that person company?

323
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,524
-I'm sorry.
-Dae-sung, good job!

324
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,525
You're the best!

325
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,402
It's okay. You're here, Brother.

326
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,653
