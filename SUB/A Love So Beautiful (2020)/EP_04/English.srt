JUNE 2006, SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN

3
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,967
Why do you look so sad?

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,386
What about you? Why are you so sad?

5
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,223
CHA HEON'S BIRTHDAY

6
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,517
Heon's birthday is coming up.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,394
I want to buy him a watch,

8
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,187
but I'm broke.

9
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,564
What about you?

10
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,898
FIELD DAY

11
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,527
I want to buy my dad a gift,
but I'm short of money.

12
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,947
If it's a gift for your dad,

13
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,033
I'll chip in.

14
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,332
Forget it. That's nowhere near enough.

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,752
Great. Then, I'll take it.
Many a little makes a mickle.

16
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,171
Many a little makes a little.
Give me that.

17
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,842
Guys, breaking news!
You won't believe this.

18
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,719
I just overheard the faculty meeting.

19
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,054
Guess what the first prize is
for the field day?

20
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,640
It's…

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,351
-A whopping…
-"Whopping"?

22
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,394
Spit it out.

23
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,646
A 1,500,000-won gift certificate!

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,400
It's a 1,500,000-won gift certificate!

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
-Isn't it awesome?
-One and a half million?

26
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,113
That's about 50,000 won per person.

27
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,161
Guys, while we're at it,

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,330
does anyone want to do the hurdle relay?

29
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,999
It consists of 50m hurdles, a sack race,

30
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,418
and eating a hot dog while hula hooping.

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,003
You have to do all three.

32
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,212
-Shall we?
-Yes.

33
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,297
We'll do it.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,722
-One, two, three.
-Let's go!

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,266
-Do you want to start practicing today?
-Yes.

36
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,992
Run. Faster.

37
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,452
Faster.

38
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,870
This way.

39
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,373
Go faster.

40
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,624
Faster.

41
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,835
I'm sure we'll win first place.

42
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,421
-Right? 1.5 million won is ours.
-Ours.

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,759
Hey, Ha-young. I got you boiled eggs.

44
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,678
Eat up. You need a lot of protein
before the field day.

45
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,347
You're making sense for once.

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,556
Here you go.

47
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,935
I'm offering you all the eggs I have.

48
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,895
Thanks.

49
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,772
If it's okay with you,

50
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,732
may I devote my life to you, too?

51
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,902
No.

52
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,532
Hey, Sol-i. You're the last runner
in the hurdle relay.

53
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,075
Go for it.

54
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,582
Shin Sol-i.

55
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,585
The fate of the 1.5 million won
is in your hands.

56
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,962
Don't worry.

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,963
I'll be your coach.

58
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's see how good you are first.

59
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,259
He's an athlete. He must be good.

60
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,080
<i>THEORY AND PRACTICE
OF TRACK AND FIELD HURDLES</i>

61
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,742
Heon!

62
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,244
I think we were meant to be.

63
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,954
I can't believe
we bumped into each other here.

64
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,501
Heon, I keep knocking over hurdles.

65
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,753
Is it because I can't keep my balance?

66
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,047
By the way,

67
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,592
weren't you good at hurdling
in middle school?

68
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,176
I won't help you.

69
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,597
You're so cold.

70
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,601
What's that book about?

71
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,061
I just picked it.

72
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>HUMAN ANATOMY</i>

73
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,897
Bye.

74
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,235
He just picked it?

75
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,034
Did you find the book
your coach asked you to find?

76
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
No. It's not here.

77
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,331
Let's just go practice.

78
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,374
Okay.

79
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,089
Am I taking too much
of your training time?

80
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,300
No worries. I practiced a lot already.

81
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,718
All right.

82
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,681
When you're hurdling,
the quicker the jump, the better!

83
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,559
Lean forward as you run.

84
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,311
Lower your center of gravity.

85
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,521
And most importantly…

86
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,026
DON'T LOSE YOUR BALANCE

87
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,528
Don't lose your balance!

88
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,659
Give it a try.

89
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,806
Are you okay?

90
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,393
You did great.

91
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,937
Good. You're fast.

92
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,647
Come on.

93
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,941
That's not how you do it.

94
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:03,858
What are you doing?

95
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,944
-Get out.
-No.

96
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,946
Watch how I do it and learn.

97
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,656
-Get out.
-What? No, thanks.

98
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,657
Get out.

99
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,743
-No.
-Get out. I'll teach you.

100
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,998
Hey, are you okay?

101
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,499
What's your problem?

102
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,751
Ha-young, are you okay? Can you walk?

103
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,753
All I did was pull the bag a little.

104
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,088
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,965
I'll take her to the nurse's office.

106
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,642
Get off me.

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,937
-Ha-young, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

108
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,899
-One, two, three.
-Three.

109
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,827
How did you get hurt?

110
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,122
She fell while practicing for
the field day and sprained her ankle.

111
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,334
Mr. Lee, is Ha-young
going to be all right?

112
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,298
Can someone die
from spraining their ankle?

113
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,176
Why are you overreacting?

114
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,720
Mr. Lee, I'm really okay,

115
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,513
and I recover really quickly.

116
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,016
I'll be perfectly fine in a few days.

117
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,185
It's swollen quite a bit. Are you sure?

118
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,228
You have to go to the hospital.

119
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,272
You need to wear a splint.

120
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,316
You can't join the race.

121
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,901
Ask someone else to do it.

122
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,320
But I have to.

123
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,905
Ha-young, listen to Mr. Lee.

124
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,698
I'll find someone to replace you.

125
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,955
I'll wash your hair

126
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,582
and carry your backpack.

127
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,876
I'll be your hands and feet.

128
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,920
Do you need anything?

129
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,047
Stop it, Jin-hwan.

130
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,134
It doesn't hurt much, though.

131
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,321
SHIN SOL-I

132
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,786
Heon, what are you doing?

133
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,412
<i>I'm studying. What's up?</i>

134
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,499
Well, it's nothing important.

135
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,418
Come to think of it,
because of the hurdle practice,

136
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,963
<i>we haven't biked home together in a while.</i>

137
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,006
You're talking as if we do that every day.

138
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,343
We still bike home together quite often.

139
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:40,056
Heon, how about we
we meet at the playground briefly?

140
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,599
Now?

141
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,768
But I'm studying right now.

142
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,229
I have something to tell you.

143
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,358
Say it over the phone.

144
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,988
Well, Ha-young hurt her leg today.

145
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,074
It's because Se-hyeong suddenly
pulled a prank.

146
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,163
So the school nurse said
she might not be able to do the race.

147
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,582
But you don't need to worry.

148
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,626
It's not serious.
She'll get better with a little rest.

149
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,378
-Okay.
-Oh, right!

150
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,297
Something really funny happened.

151
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,757
Jin-hwan tried to lift Ha-young up.

152
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
But he couldn't. He struggled so hard.

153
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,096
Isn't it so funny?

154
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,310
Heon, are you listening?

155
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,645
-Yes.
-Okay.

156
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,148
<i>Anyway, we need to find a replacement
for Ha-young.</i>

157
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,191
<i>It's too bad, isn't it?</i>

158
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,202
Jeez.

159
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,083
Do you know why she's practicing so hard?

160
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,251
She wants to buy

161
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,754
a birthday present for someone.

162
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,511
Heon!

163
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,858
Dae-sung, you should teach her again.
She can't jump a single one.

164
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,238
I tried my best.

165
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,492
Ha-young. Don't be bothered.

166
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,869
Sol-i doesn't have the right build
to begin with.

167
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,958
Jin-hwan, you're too hard on her.

168
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,709
He's right. Cheer for her.

169
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,884
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

170
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,887
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

171
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

172
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,058
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,156
Dae-sung. Move aside. I'm tired.

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,952
Your posture is completely wrong.

175
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,122
What?

176
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,379
Heon, will you help me?

177
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,008
I saw the other girls, and it looked like
none of them could hurdle right.

178
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,303
Your short legs aren't to blame,
so don't worry.

179
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,180
Are you here to insult me?

I will!

182
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,744
Your records don't look good.

183
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,000
I hear you spend more time on
the running track than you do in the pool.

I can't believe I had to go

Thank you so much.

252
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,105
No problem. I had fun.

253

Man, you're sweating a lot.

254
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,651
It was really hot.

255

I thought it was 1.5 million won,
but turns out it's 150,000 won.

259
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,717
How many zeros were there?

260
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,972
I can't buy anything with this.

261
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,933
Anyway,

262
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,353
I have to go see my dad now.

263
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,815
Now? Why? You'll get caught at the gate.

264
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,902
But I have to go now. I'm already late.

265
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,528
Actually, my dad is

266
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,407
departing today. I won't be able to
see him for a few months.

267
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,408
Then you should hurry.

268
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,328
-Is there any way?
-Jump over the gate.

269
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,499
The one behind the nurse's office.

270
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,965
Go. Ha-young, you can do it.

Hey, what are you doing?

272
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,182
Hurry.

The dean's coming. Ha-young, hurry.

274
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,978
What are you doing?

275
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,605
How dare you touch my Ha-young?

276
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,565
Then what? Do you want her to get caught?

277
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,235
Hey, what are you doing over there?

278
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,194
Spread out now.

279
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,279
You rascals!

280
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,448
What do you think you're doing?

281
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,742
Stop right there. What are you doing?

282
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,203
Step aside.

283
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,206
Wait, sir. There's a dog!

284
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,457
Help me.

285
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,292
I'm scared of dogs.

286

-Please.
-What?

-You won't do anything bad, right?

297

Yes. What?

298
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,841
