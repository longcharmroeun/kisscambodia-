<i>JULY 2007, SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN</i>

3
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>What are you doing next Saturday?</i>

4
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,999
<i>Do you want to hang out? You can't say no!</i>

5
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,786
Sol-i. What are you doing next Saturday?

6
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,123
Do you want to go to
the Dream Concert with me?

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,004
Sorry. I'm watching
the MUFC match that day

8
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,172
with Heon.

9
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,924
What? Did you get the tickets?

10
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,345
Don't I have plenty of time to buy them?

11
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,138
MUFC isn't a morning soccer club.

12
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,140
The tickets must be sold out already.

13
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,518
Sol-i, do you know what team MUFC is?

14
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,687
Yes, it's Ji-sung Park's team.

15
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,898
Heon is a huge fan of MUFC.

16
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,067
This is a rare opportunity.

17
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,444
How tear-jerking.

18
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,697
Even scalping tickets
are really expensive.

19
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,703
Man, it's so clean.

20
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,040
Mother.

21
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,877
I finished cleaning.

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,629
Will you give me some allowance?

23
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,216
There.

24
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,426
Give me a little more.

25
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,846
I cleaned the living room
and my room really nicely.

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,681
How much more do you need?

27
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,102
A hundred thousand won?

28
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,896
You want 100,000 won
for 10 minutes of cleaning?

29
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,439
What a thief.

30
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,237
Well, MUFC is coming to Seoul
next Saturday.

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,447
I want to see their match.

32
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,699
Park Ji-sung will be playing.

33
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,078
I may not get another chance
to see a match like this.

34
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,831
Just watch it on TV. We have a TV.

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,999
Mom.

36
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,845
What? Am I too handsome?

37
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,014
Haven't you looked in the mirror?

38
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,142
Anyway, how much money do you have?

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,063
Ha-young, you can't take money
from someone by force publicly.

40
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,440
Just tell me how much you have.

41
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,692
We need to buy Sol-i's birthday gift.

42
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,528
Is it Brother's birthday? When is it?

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,821
Next Saturday.

44
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,782
What? Why didn't I know?

45
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:05,287
Maybe she was worried
you'd buy her a building if you knew.

46
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,789
Ha-young, now that Dae-sung knows,

47
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,750
we won't have to buy her a gift.

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,876
Come on.

49
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,919
Are we not her friends?

50
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,342
Here. It's all of my pocket money
for this month.

51
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,512
We'll be able to buy a MUFC ticket
with this with your money, right?

52
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,972
A MUFC ticket?

53
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,892
Don't worry about it, Dae-sung.
Focus on tomorrow's swim meet.

54
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,437
We'll be there to cheer for you,
so you better place first.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,606
Don't you worry about that.

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,774
See you tomorrow.

57
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,984
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

58
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,152
Go for it.

59
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,115
Jin-hwan, you said you have a friend
who's a pro at buying these.

60
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,533
Ask him.

61
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
Put this in your pocket.

62
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,162
If you lose it,

63
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,081
I'll kill you.

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,585

PRIDE OF YUIL
WOO DAE-SUNG, LET'S GO!

66
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,214
If he places first,
he's the best in Korea, right?

67
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,548
Yes. That's right.

68
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,551
Ha-young, I'm already nervous.

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,595
I don't think I can watch.

70
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,847
Then go outside and don't bother me.

71
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,433
It's Dae-sung.

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,897
-Woo Dae-sung!
-Woo Dae-sung!

73
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>Ready.</i>

74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,715
BEST SWIMMER!
WOO DAE-SUNG

75
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,099
You're almost there.

76
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,600
Go, Woo Dae-sung!

77
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,355
Yes!

78
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,028
1: WOO DAE-SUNG

79
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,198
He came first!

80
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,957
Dae-sung's here.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,668
PRIDE OF YUIL
WOO DAE-SUNG, LET'S GO!

82
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,296
Dae-sung, congratulations
on reclaiming the first place.

83
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,839
Thank you.

84
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,258
You failed to place first
In the last national championships,

85
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,302
but you reclaimed the top spot this time.

86
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,888
I want to know how you were able
to overcome the slump and win today.

87
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,724
It's all

88
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,892
thanks to her.

89
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,107
Dae-sung, are you going public
with your girlfriend?

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,775
Can you tell us more?

91
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,738
He says it's thanks to Sol-i, Shin-sol-i!

92
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,198
Incredible. Are you guys
going to date each other?

93
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,287
<i>Eat up.</i>

94
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,292
Oh, Dae-sung and Shin Sol-i!

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,835
Why are you guys so close?

96
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,713
Are you really dating each other or what?

97
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,466
When did you start dating?
Who made the move first?

98
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,925
When's the official announcement?

99
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,262
I want to know!

100
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,221
-Se-hyeong!
-What?

101
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,390
I want to know.

102
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,725
I'm curious.

103
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,728
Are you okay?

104
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,272
-Se-hyeong, you…
-Sorry.

105
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,149
Heon.

106
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,611
-What?
-Don't wait for me after school.

107
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,112
I have somewhere to go.

108
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,448
We'll have more fun on Saturday, okay?

109
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,743
I told you this was Brother's.

110
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,370
-Sir!
-Welcome.

111
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,458
I'm sorry. I already hired someone.

112
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,251
Did you?

113
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,920
Excuse me, one <i>soju</i>, please.

114
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,546
Okay. Coming right up.

115
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,092
-One <i>soju</i>, please.
-Okay.

116
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,138
Here you go, two bulgogi burger meals.

117
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,682
Thank you. Enjoy.

118
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,266
Hey.

119
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,395
Wait, Dae-sung?

120
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,440
What have you been doing until now

121
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,900
instead of going home for dinner?

122
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,945
I couldn't get a part-time job,

123
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,072
and I was starving.

124
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,782
Do you work here?

125
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,784
I'm so jealous.

126
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,411
-Why do you need a job?
-Oh.

127
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,955
I have something to buy.

128
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,042
By the way, Dae-sung. I have a question.

129
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,378
What is it?

130
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,424
What's the secret you wrote down that day?

131
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,263
I…

132
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,640
Well…

133
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,271
Hamburgers!
I think wrote, "I love hamburgers."

134
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,773
For real? So it's not a lie, is it?

135
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,358
Of course not!

136
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,486
Okay.

137
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,032
Thanks.

138
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,163
Heon.

139
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,627
I was going to give it to you on Saturday.

140
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,469
Ta-da! It's a uniform
with Park Ji-sung's autograph.

141
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,138
I wanted to go see
the MUFC match with you,

142
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,098
but I couldn't get a ticket,
so I bought this.

143
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,100
It's okay. You can have it.

144
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,854
Why? You like Park Ji-sung.

145
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,189
I don't need it.

146
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,945
I went through so much to get this.

147
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,990
-I asked Dae-sung, and--
-How much was it?

148
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,410
Fifty thousand won.

149
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,128
There. So stop following me.

150
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,756
I won't be there on Saturday either,

151
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,382
so don't wait for me.

152
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,919
Jin-hwan, what are you doing?

153
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,968
Why are you avoiding me?

154
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,971
-I am not.
-Yes, you are.

155
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,013
Look at me.

156
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,390
I am not.

157
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,977
I can't look at you
because you're too dazzling.

158
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,938
Stop joking and tell me the truth.
What is it?

159
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,232
Well…

160
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,568
Actually…

161
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,487
I lost it.

162
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,783
You idiot! How can you lose it?

163
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,244
I'm sorry, Ha-young. but technically,

164
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,037
-I didn't lose it, it was taken--
-Okay.

165
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,790
Change of plans.

166
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,012
What's up?

167
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,054
Cha Heon.

168
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,224
You know Sol-i's trying to get
a ticket to the MUFC match, right?

169
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,311
Why do you think
she's going through all that trouble?

170
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,231
The match is on
the same day as the Dream Concert.

171
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,567
All of Sol-i's favorite singers
will be there.

172
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,819
Hey.

173
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,196
You know it's Sol-i's birthday
this Saturday, right?

174
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,747
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

175
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,130
LET'S MAKE A SCHOOL
WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY TOGETHER

176
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,340
Hello.

177
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,925
Do you know where Dae-sung is?

178
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,887
Well…

179
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,514
The next meet is just around the corner.

180
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,351
He's been missing practice
during this critical period.

181
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,645
He hasn't been coming home, either.

182
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,521
Coach.

183
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,066
Don't be too hard on him.

184
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,361
He's a good kid,
and swimming is everything to him.

185
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,323
He never missed practice
even when he hung out with us.

186
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,909
He likes spending time with us,

187
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
but he said he's the happiest
when he swims.

188
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,917
I think Dae-sung is amazing.

189
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,836
Okay, payment by card.

190
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,591
-Here's your receipt. Thank you.
-Thank you.

191
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,517
Hello.

192
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,394
What would you--

193
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,401
One bulgogi meal, please.

194
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,240
Payment by card.

195
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,533
Please.

196
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,243
Come home tonight.

197
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,854
Who was that?

198
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,731
-Pardon?
-Who was he?

199
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,609
Well…

200
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,908
My dad.

201
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,765
Jin-hwan.

202
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,226
Well…

203
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,729
The Dream Concert ticket.

204
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,315
Where can I buy it?

205
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,568
HEON

206
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,286
<i>Hello?</i>

207
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,664
What's tomorrow's lunch menu?

208
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,375
-What?
<i>-What's tomorrow's lunch menu?</i>

209
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,878
Curry rice.

210
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,089
Why do you ask?

211
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,425
I was just curious.

212
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,761
I see.

213
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>Good night.</i>

214
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,597
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

215
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,741
I'm still mad at him, though.

216
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,122
My daughter.

217
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,291
Do you want to see what I got?

218
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,378
Ta-da. I got two tickets.

219
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,505
Wow. For real?

220
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,091
Why the long face? Is something wrong?

221
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,342
No.

222
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,512
Thanks anyway, Dad.

223
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,936
Sol-i.

224
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,563
Yes?

225
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,317
Hi.

226
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,778
Yes. Hi.

227
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,710
Good morning.

228
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,961
Oh, good morning.

229
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,839
Did you go home last night?

230
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, thanks to you.

231
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,344
I'm a great friend, aren't I?

232
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
Of course. Brother, you're the best.

233
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,557
Do you have plans tomorrow?
Let's hang out.

234
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,852
I…

235
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,855
-Well…
-Sol-i.

236
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,316
Yes?

237
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,444
Got any correction tape?

238
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes. I'll check.

239
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,710
Here.

240
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,506
Thanks.

241
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,649
TICKETS

242
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,113
-Hello?
-Where are you?

243
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,448
I'm at the stadium.

244
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,533
<i>What about you?</i>

245
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,036
Where exactly? I don't see you.

246
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,956
I'm at the main entrance. Come here.

247
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,166
<i>The match starts in an hour.</i>

248
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,627
-"The match"?
-Yes. What?

249
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
We said we'd watch the MUFC match.

250
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,674
Okay.

251
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,718
I'll be there.

252
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,602
Sol-i.

253
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,979
Heon!

254
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,400
What? These are fake?

255
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,362
How can these be fake?

256
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,824
My dad paid a lot for these tickets.

257
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,119
Look. It doesn't say "Mankheste United."

258
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,456
It says "Mankheste Unit."

259
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,084
But these are the most realistic
rip-offs I saw today.

260
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,462
Oh…

261
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,590
Please check them one more time.

262
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,176
-Let's just go.
-How?

263
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,013
Dad couldn't have bought fake tickets.

264
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,682
Right. Heon's mom told me

265
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,268
the MUFC tickets cost a lot.

266
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:05,978
How much were they?

267
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,980
They weren't expensive.

268
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,983
I bought them on the internet.
Do you know how much they were?

269
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,777
Only 30,000 won.

270
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,863
-Goodness.
-Also, it was a two-for-one.

271
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,908
Gi-heon, that was a smart purchase.

272
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,661
Didn't I do a good job?

273
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,829
-Good job.
-Thanks.

274
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,674
Heon.

275
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,927
Can you plug your ears for a minute?

276
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,152
I'm sorry. I was fixing my clothes.

277
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,659
By the way, Heon,

278
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,537
don't you have anything to say to me?

279
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,457
-Like what?
-Well,

280
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,128
The secret you wrote down.

281
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
That's supposed to stay secret.

282
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
What did you write?

283
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,385
Please tell me.

284
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,609
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

285
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,368
<i>I don't want to play this game.</i>

286
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,581
<i>I like Shin Sol-i.</i>

287
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,631
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

288
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,762
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

289
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,727
<i>The person I like is here.</i>

290
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,985
-What's wrong?
-What?

291
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
Nothing. Never mind.

292
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,574
Let's go.

293
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:24,992
Okay.

294
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,178
Sol-i.

295
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,347
Yes?

296
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,515
Happy birthday.

297
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,563
Yes. Thanks.

I'm sure this is the place.

300

Where is it?

301
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,713
What are you looking for?

302
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,216
On the day we fought,

303
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,844
I threw the money on the ground.

304
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,596
Did you take it?

305
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,473
-Of course not.
-Darn it.

306
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,226
I can't find it.

307
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,228
I guess someone took it.

308
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,690
That was days ago. It can't be here.

309
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,150
Right?

310
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,487
Anyway, Heon,
that looks really good on you.

311
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:01,171
By the way,
Park Ji-sung's back number is 13.

312
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,606
Jeez, I guess I got scammed, too.

313
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,358
Let's go.

314
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,444
Okay.

315
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,298
<i>What should I do?</i>

316
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,508
<i>What else? Just go out with him.</i>

317
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,511
<i>I saw the Game of Truth note.</i>

318
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,388
-That was just a joke.
-What?

319
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,848
<i>Did you believe that?</i>

320
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,475
Being a girl doesn't give you a free pass.

321
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,810
<i>Hey! Leave her alone.</i>
