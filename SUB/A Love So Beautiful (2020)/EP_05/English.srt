<i>1. LOVERS IN PARIS</i>
2. <i>WHAT HAPPENED IN BALI</i>, 3. <i>FULL HOUSE</i>

3
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,791
My daughter!

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,627
There you are.
Did you see the new bike I got you?

5
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,922
Anyway, what's up?

6
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,800
Dad, which do you think will suit me best?

7
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,344
-What?
-<i>Full House</i>, perhaps?

8
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,555
Don't I remind you of Song Hye-kyo?

9
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>A family of three bears live together</i>

10
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,815
You must think I'm blind, jeez.

11
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,234
Unbelievable.

12
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,444
Then how about <i>What Happened in Bali</i>?

13
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,072
Don't I remind you of Zo In-sung?

14
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,448
Let me see.

15
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,076
"I'm a bit…"

16
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,537
"Busy."

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,788
Dad,

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,374
I'm not blind, either.

19
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,671
How about this then?

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,881
"'That man is mine.

21
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,634
He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,387
"How can I, when I look like this?

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,140
How can I say that amid those people?"

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,975
Stop fooling around.

25
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,435
He's my man.

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,644
Go to your room and study.

27
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,856
-You…
-Don't!

28
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>I will tell you carefully</i>

29
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>I will muster up the courage</i>

30
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:59,036
<i>Starting from today, can I love…</i>

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,662
Stop ruining a masterpiece.

32
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,957
Aren't I perfect for the Han Gi-jun role?

33
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,418
Please let me do it, Ms. Shin!

34
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,171
I can portray Han Gi-jun with perfection.

35
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,382
No, you can't.
The male lead is already taken.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,385
What? Already?

37
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,930
-Who is it?
-Can't you take a hint?

38
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,195
Is the drama festival preparation
going well?

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,529
-Yes.
-Yes.

40
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,531
We'll choose the class representative
this Saturday,

41
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,450
and everyone's to participate.

42
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,451
-Okay.
-Okay.

43
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,411
Hui-ji, bring me the list of groups.

44
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,246
-Yes, Ms. Moon.
-Dismissed.

45
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,083
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,419
-Heon!
-Cha Heon.

47
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,172
Would you like to join my group
for the school play?

48
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,883
Our group will do <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.

49
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,803
You'll be joining me, Su-jin,
Mi-nyeo, and Se-hyeong.

50
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,350
No.

51
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,143
Don't.

52
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,646
I'll think about it.

53
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,617
Heon, you know <i>Lovers in Paris</i>, right?

54
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,495
"'That man is mine.

55
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,664
He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

56
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,000
That's what we chose.

57
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,377
So? Sounds fun, right?

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,753
I bet you want to join us.

59
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,342
"Let's go, baby."

60
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm not a baby.

61
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,026
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY THAT?

62
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,071
"You taught me of love that doesn't change

63
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,615
even in light or darkness.

64
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,912
However, the moment
when darkness switched to light,

65
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,039
your face went on and off.

66
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:12,002
That's how unstable your face is."

67
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,589
What I just read was <i>Love</i>
by the poet Kim Soo-young.

68
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,800
Then which statement about this poem
is true?

69
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,386
<i>"That man is mine. He is my boyfriend."</i>

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,888
<i>Why can't you say that?</i>

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
Number one.

72
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,239
"THAT MAN IS MINE. HE IS MY BOYFRIEND."
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY THAT?

73
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,956
<i>"Let's go, baby."</i>

74
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>Baby's not here.</i>

75
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,049
<i>LOVERS IN PARIS</i>

<i>I will tell you carefully</i>

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,230
<i>I will muster up the courage</i>

78
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>Starting from today…</i>

79
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,528
-<i>Can I love you?</i>
-<i>Can I love you?</i>

Your script…

82
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,254
You're joining us? Will you?

83
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,509
You drooled on it.

84

DRAMA FESTIVAL GROUP LIST

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,527
Let me see.

86
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,697
I see one person is missing.

87
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,867
-Who is it?
-It's Cha Heon.

88
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,704
Ms. Moon, our group happens
to be short of one member.

89
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,997
Is that so?

90
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,083
Then Heon can join Hui-ji's group.

91
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,961
Get practicing, guys.

92
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,170
-Okay.
-Okay.

93
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,690
Mr. Lee.

94
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,109
Hi.

95
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,238
It's the cardigan
I borrowed the other day.

96
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,948
Oh, right.

97
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,534
Thank you for helping me that day.

98
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,619
I got it dry-cleaned, too.

99
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,329
Thanks.

100
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,292
CARL SAGAN

101
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,858
Ha-young, are you all right?

102
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,652
-Sure.
-Is your leg better?

103
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,279
Of course.

104
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,824
It is.

105
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,467
-Are you all right?
-Sure.

106
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,927
I'm fine.

107
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,763
No, I'm not.

108
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,932
You see…

109
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,393
Well, I'm Ha-young's classmate.

110
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,648
I have a heart condition.

111
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,234
You see…

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,904
It's been like that since birth,

113
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,032
and I was rushed off
to the ER several times.

114
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,909
I mean, I'm not ill right now,

115
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,036
but it could relapse in the future.

116
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,830
We'll get going now.

117
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,751
-Sure.
-Bye.

118
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,768
What? You heard the Bells of Destiny?

119
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,020
Yes, I heard it in my head.

120
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,232
Ding-ding-ding.

121
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,819
Are you sure it wasn't the school bell?

122
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:15,406
The ringing in your head
that went ding-ding-ding.

123
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,991
Come on!

124
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,829
Anyway, promise me you won't tell anyone.

125
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,330
-It's our little secret.
-Deal.

126
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,170
What are you doing after class?
Got any plans?

127
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,922
Not really. Why do you ask?

128
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,924
Great. Let's practice together.

129
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,635
Oh, you look really enthusiastic.

130
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,428
Ha-young, join us.

131
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,639
I have math class today.

132
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,100
I'll memorize my lines
by tomorrow morning. Sorry.

133
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,353
That's too bad.

134
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,356
It sure is.

135
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,493
CELL PHONE? KEYS?
GAS VALVE? CHECK WHO'S AT THE DOOR

136
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,792
GRANDMA, DID YOU TURN OFF THE TV?

137
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,172
My grandma keeps forgetting things.

138
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,132
Sometimes, she doesn't,

139
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,676
but I still put up notes here and there.

140
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,595
I see.

141
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,098
It's a very clever idea, though.

142
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,560
I should do the same
with the things I keep forgetting.

143
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,771
Goodness, is my Dae-sung home?

144
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,315
Yes, Grandma. I'm home.

145
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,151
Hello, I'm his classmate, Shin Sol-i.

146
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,819
I see. Well, it's a pleasure.

147
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,655
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

148
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,824
I'll get you something to eat.

149
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,619
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

150
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,831
What about your parents?

151
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,046
It's just my grandma, my dad, and me,

152
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,964
but my dad must be busy today.

153
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,468
I see.

154
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,221
Want to see my room?

155
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,890
Sure.

156
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,526
Thanks.

157
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,570
For what?

158
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
I was a swimmer since I was little,

159
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,118
so I couldn't go to school often.

160
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,538
But here, I got to make
friends like you guys,

161
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,167
go to karaokes,
and even work on a school play.

162
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,169
Every day is exciting.

163
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,797
Right? Are you having fun with me?

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,007
Yes. You're the best, brother.

165
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,943
-What the…
-Move!

166
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,990
Wang Se-hyeong!

167
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,534
Watch it. And take it outside.

168
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,995
There's no need to get angry about it.

169
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,960
Get lost.

170
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,299
Wait for me!

171
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,013
PRESCRIPTION
JEONG JIN-HWAN

172
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,764
I have a heart condition.

173
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,059
Was it true?

174
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,320
"Goodness.

175
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,239
I just bought this, you know.

176
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
How can I go home wearing this?"

177
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,452
"I'm sorry. Let me have it dry-cleaned--"

178
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,829
"Lady, can't you see my baby's outfit?

179
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
Dry-cleaning won't cut it!"

180
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,254
"Sir! Can't you see my baby's scared?"

181
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,506
"Baby, are you all right?

182
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,258
Let's go, baby."

183

"Am I invisible to you?

184
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,234
How do you think I felt?

185
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,236
The woman I love was crying,

186
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,198
but I didn't have the power to help her.

187
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,617
How do you think I felt

188
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,078
asking another man to help you?"

189
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,829
What the hell?

190
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,044
"You are…

191
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,172
inside my heart."

192
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,719
Jin-hwan, that was hilarious!

193
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
That was great.

194
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,538
Why weren't we chosen?

195
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,625
It's because Ha-young wasn't the lead!

196
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,836
Sol-i, answer me.

197
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,672
"Why can't you say that?"

198
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,550

201
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,435
you couldn't talk.

202
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,691

Where's the MP3 player?

207
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,795

Shin Sol-i messed it up, didn't she?

00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,266
-It was completely ruined.
-I know.

Shin Sol-i's always the problem.

-Have you seen Sol-i?

255
