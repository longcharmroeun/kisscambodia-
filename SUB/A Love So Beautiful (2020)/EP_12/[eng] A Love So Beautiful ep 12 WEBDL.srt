MARCH 2008, SPRING OF NINETEEN

3
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,107
Mi-nyeo. You've gotten so much prettier.
Did you lose weight?

4
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,610
Do you want to sit here? Hey, move.

5
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,154
-Where will I sit then?
-I don't know. Move.

6
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,283
What's wrong with Se-hyeong?

7
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,826
Did his eyesight get worse?

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,036
Poor guy.

9
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,039
Guys!

10
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,792
Breaking news.

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,878
Ms. Moon will be
our homeroom teacher again.

12
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,632
Jin-hwan,
you can't call that breaking news.

13
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,218
-Yes, you can. There's one more thing.
-What is it?

14
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,346
After the mock exam,
we'll do volunteer work

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,265
and go on a picnic.

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,102
I should've delivered the breaking news.

17
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,522
-Jin-hwan stole my spotlight.
-You are no match for me.

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,275
Volunteer work and picnic?
We should study if we have time.

19
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,277
We're seniors now.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,030
Hey, Su-jin. Study hard by yourself then.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,989
-Okay?
-What?

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,493
He's so annoying.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,538
What should we do at the picnic?

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,583
-Anything. As long as we're out of school.
-Me, too.

25
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,045
Hi.

26
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,671
-Hello.
-Hello.

27
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,966
I see so many familiar faces.

28
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,885
It's good to see you again.

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,596
Let's not be at the end of the ranking
this year, please.

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,181
-Okay.
-Okay.

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,934
Ms. Moon, will we go on a picnic
on the volunteering day?

32
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,772
Yes. But, don't get too excited
before then,

33
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,231
and study hard.

34
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,274
-Okay.
-Okay.

35
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,485
Ms. Moon, after the volunteer work,

36
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,196
can we go camping
and have a barbecue party?

37
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,114
-I'm in.
-Ms. Moon.

38
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,283
Let's have fun for the last time.

39
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,911
Ms. Moon. We'll place first
on the mock exam.

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,123
-Barbecue.
-Barbecue.

41
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,794
-Barbecue!
-Barbecue!

42
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,045
-Barbecue!
-Okay.

43
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,963
I'll ask for permission.

44
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,365
Heon, I prepared this for you.

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,911
Goodness.
Nobody has ever proposed to me like this.

46
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,497
To hell with it. Sol-i, be my girlfriend.

47
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,446
Dae-sung.

48
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,157
What are you thinking about?
Look up when you're walking.

49
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,033
Right.

50
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,078
Anyway, how much money do you have?
You're still counting it.

51
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,415
Not much. I won't be able to buy snacks
this month.

52
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,416
Why not?

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,544
it's because…

54
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,189
Isn't this scary?

55
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,524
No, it isn't.

56
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,236
It's not scary. I see.

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,654
It's cute. What is it?

58
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,784
It's not scary.

59
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,494
It's cute.

60
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,171
What's your name?

61
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,692
Hello.

62
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,236
Hello.

63
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,153
Ta-da.

64
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,863
-Ta-da.
-It's so cute.

65
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,408
Candles.

66
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,544
How pretty.

67
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,635
Hello?

68
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,970
<i>Dae-sung, where are you?</i>

69
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,304
PARTY SUPPLIES SHOP

70
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,723
I'm in front of the school.

71
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,561
<i>Come to the pool right now then.
The national team coach is here.</i>

72
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,856
Okay.

73
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,486
What is it? Is something wrong?

74
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,533
I have to go first,
so I can't walk you home. I'm sorry.

75
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,577
No, it's okay. You should go.

76
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,079
You'll come to the picnic, right?

77
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,874
Yes, of course.

78
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,793
I'll get going. Go home safe.

79
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,752
Okay.

80
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,302
-Bye.
-Bye.

81
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,681
Go.

82
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,922
What are you doing here?

83
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,716
What's that?

84
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,637
This? It's a secret.

85
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,388
Why are you out here?

86
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,973
Can't you see?

87
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm taking out the trash.

88
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,857
You've been taking out the trash
when the bag isn't full yet.

89
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,777
Since when?

90
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,698
I mean, I thought you were waiting for me.

91
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,785
Me? Why would I?

92
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,082
I mean, I just wish you were.

93
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,800
I must be out of my mind.

94
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,221
Heon, I didn't hear you. What did you say?

95
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,181
Heon!

96
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,935
Payment by card.

97
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,605
Enjoy the movie.

98
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,648
Thank you.

99
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,366
Please give me a ticket
for the movie he's watching.

100
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,201
-Do you want the same movie?
-Yes.

101
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,579
Can I sit in the seat next to him?

102
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,873
Then, I'll sit next to her.

103
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,293
What? How did you know I was here?

104
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:26,006
All I did was follow you.
And I ended up here.

105
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,507
Go home. Hurry.

106
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,011
It's dangerous at night.
I'll take you home after the movie.

107
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,888
Excuse me. Are you going to pay?

108
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,140
-Yes, please.
-No, don't.

109
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,641
-Yes.
-No.

110
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,061
Ha-young and Jin-hwan?

111
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,647
Hello.

112
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,358
Hello.

113
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,626
Ha-young. Say, "Ah."

114
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,587
Just keep your eyes on the movie.

115
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,009
The popcorn is really good.
It's the best snack for movies.

116
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,264
This is the first movie
we're watching together. It will be fun.

117
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,682
Don't talk to me.

118
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,234
Ha-young, isn't this a horror movie?

119
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,487
My heart is pounding.

120
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,492
If it gets too scary,

121
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,285
can I hold your hand?

122
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,079
Stop bothering me!

123
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,674
I'm on a diet.

124
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,849
This is great.
It's not cold at all, is it?

125
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,893
-No.
-It's nice.

126
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,937
-The weather is perfect.
-Great.

127
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,814
-Goodness.
-It's so nice.

128
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,398
-I love it.
-Perfect.

129
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,734
What? Both of you have this?

130
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,737
-Yes. It's really good.
-Really? I should buy one, too.

131
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,030
It's the best.

132
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,533
Be quiet, guys.

133
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,368
Are you here to have fun?

134
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,371
-Why are you so noisy?
-Yes, we're here for fun.

135
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,456
Why else would we be here, for a test?

136
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,669
Why is he so tough on us?
Is he a drill sergeant or something?

137
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,380
"Depending on your attitude,
today could be heaven--"

138
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,173
"Or hell."

139
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,550
We're getting along today.

140
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,551
Nice.

141
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm not following you.

142
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,331
I know. Who cares?

143
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,480
Hey, Mi-nyeo.

144
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,316
Can I have a bite? I'm hungry.

145
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,527
-Yes. Sit down.
-Really?

146
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,698
Say, "Ah."

147
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,577
-Isn't it yummy?
-It is.

148
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,593
Ha-young. Drink this.

149
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,219
No, thanks.

150
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,766
Ha-young, are you mad at me?

151
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,603
Yes. Totally.

152
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,981
Why? What did I do wrong?

153
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,609
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,446
-You're so stupid.
-I won't do it again.

155
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,076
-Hold this.
-Yes, ma'am.

156
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,164
"Collect the trash."

157
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,447
It's Heon.

158
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,057
I'm exhausted.

159
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:15,480
Ms. Moon, you should've added
sliced ham instead of tomato.

160
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,818
-Lean on me.
-What?

161
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,695
I'll be your backrest.

162
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,117
It's comfortable.

163
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,662
You aren't mad at me anymore, right?

164
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,332
Your back is vibrating. Don't talk.

165
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,708
Okay.

166
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,128
By the way,

167
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,050
sitting back to back like this
makes my heart race.

168
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,303
Stop disturbing me and be quiet.

169
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,975
Thank you, Ms. Moon.

170
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,936
I appreciate it.

171
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,545
What was this song?

172
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,384
You…

173
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,095
You're

174
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
too dangerous.

175
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,823
Based on what I saw for the last two days,
he's doing great.

176
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,077
It's only natural for a young swimmer
to have ups and downs.

177
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
He has potential.

178
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,457
-Can he make the national team?
-Yes.

179
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,751
If he keeps up,
he'll make the Olympic team too.

180
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,921
Dae-sung, I'll see you
at the National Training Center soon.

181
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,551
Thank you!

182
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,366
-Really?
-Yes.

183
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,578
Heon. I can't open this.

184
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,330
Can you help me?

185
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,499
Okay.

186
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,293
-Look at that.
-Give me that.

187
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,005
-Thanks.
-Put it down.

188
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,924
Put it down!

189
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,301
What should we do?

190
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,773
-Oh, Sol-i!
-Oh, Sol-i!

191
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,902
All right.

192
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,989
Let's do our best this year.

193
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,074
-Okay.
-Okay.

194
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
"We can't put it off any longer.

195
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,662
My wedding, your university!"

196
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,206
What?

197
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,124
What are you doing?

198
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,834
My wedding!

199
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,754
-Our university!
-Our university!

200
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:29,757
Thank you.

201
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,718
-I'm starving.
-It's really delicious.

202
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,387
It's really good.

203
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,061
Heon.

204
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,823
Meet me at the trail over there
in five minutes.

205
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,219
Thank you, my friends.

206
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,762
Why is it crooked?

207
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,684
I finished my volunteer work earlier.
Why am I volunteering again?

208
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,562
Hey, stop whining and just do it.

209
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,064
Got it.

210
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,902
Everything looks so romantic.

211
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,572
Everything looks so excessive.

212
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,619
Hey, Heon is coming.

213
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,204
-Hurry.
-There are still a few more to light.

214
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,164
Just go, idiot.

215
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,082
-Sol-i, good luck.
-Thanks.

216
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
Good luck.

217
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,841
Hey, Heon.

218
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,893
Why did you wrap this around you?

219
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,770
I was in a hurry.

220
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,899
Ha-young, if you like romantic events,
shall I prepare one for you?

221
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,735
Be quiet. I'm still mad at you.

222
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,197
Why are you mad at me?
We had fun watching a movie yesterday.

223
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,157
Quiet. I think Heon is almost here.

224
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,742
-Get ready.
-Okay.

225
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,790
What about your family? Do they know?

226
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,294
No.

227
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,092
One, two, three.

228
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,940
TODAY IS OUR DAY 1

229
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,437
Don't look.

230
00:20:39,461 --> 00:21:09,461

<i>Did you like Sol-i, too,
but played hard to get?</i>

232
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,015
<i>You did. You played hard to get.</i>

233
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,141
<i>That's not it.</i>

234
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

235
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,604
Why are you always causing trouble?

236
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
<i>Stop. Go in first.</i>

237
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,232
What are you doing right now?

238
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,026
<i>Heon. You're such a jerk.</i>

239
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,534
I had a lot of fun today. Thanks.

240
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,535
<i>So did I.</i>

241
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,204
Is this yours?

242
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,247
<i>No.</i>

243
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>-I like Sol-i.
-So what?</i>

244
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,960
Don't hurt her feelings.
