2
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,077
Are you feeling better now?

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,040
Thanks.

4
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,837
We'll be late.

5
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,380
What?

6
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,183
-Come on.
-What?

7
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
Oh, okay.

8
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,065
Should I hold that for you?

9
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,860
-Sure.
-All right.

10
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,167
Good job.

11
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,878
Sol-i, you're running for class president?

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,506
But you always copy my homework,
doze off in class,

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,216
or doodle when you're less tired--

14
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,926
-Catch!
-I'm just saying.

15
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,721
I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with that.

16
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,265
No one in our class
is class president material.

17
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,309
Woo Dae-sung barely comes to school

18
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,436
and Cha Heon doesn't even know
his classmates' names.

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,313
But my Ha-young--

20
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,569
Heon, are you busy?

21
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,405
I finished writing my election speech.

22
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,324
Can you proofread it?

23
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,576
Sure. I'll catch you later.

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,494
Okay.

25
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,454
Are you really going to back off?

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,625
Your beloved Heon and that sly Hui-ji
will be fellow prefects at this rate.

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,335
Will you let that happen?

28
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,962
No, right?

29
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,924
"Hello, I'm Shin Sol-i!"

30
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,969
"Hello, I'm Shin Sol-i."

31
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,306
"Hello, I am Shin Sol-i."

32
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,769
It's not like they don't know who I am.

33
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,689
Oh, my gosh!

34
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,525
Why are you so down today?

35
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,695
Where's your spirit, Brother? Your voice
used to ring throughout the whole school.

36
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,072
Let me see.

37
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,159
"I, Shin Sol-i, will devote myself

38
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,246
and do everything I can for class 1-7!"

39
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,541
"I, Wang Se-hyeong,

40
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,836
will devote all my energy to my classmates

41
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,756
and do everything I can for class 1-7!"

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,469
-Wang Se-hyeong!
-Wang Se-hyeong!

43
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,639
-Vote for number three, Wang Se-hyeong!
-Vote for number three, Wang Se-hyeong!

44
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,101
By the way, Se-hyeong,
can I have one more bread?

45
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,730
Don't tell me
you copied Se-hyeong's speech.

46
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,232
Did you have the same tutor then?

47
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,319
I'm doomed for sure.

48
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,038
Rather than using such a cliché,

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,583
find what only you can offer.

50
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,794
Maybe I should just withdraw.

51
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,004
Don't worry.

52
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,965
You too have something to offer, Brother.

53
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,175
Which is what?

54
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,051
Your sincerity.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,138
What? My sincerity?

56
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,017
You may be like a punching bag right now,

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,478
but you're without doubt
going to do your best.

58
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,896
Of course.

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,982
That alone makes you
deserving of the title class president.

60
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,277
Is that a compliment?

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,742
My Brother.

62
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,328
You have excellent
listening comprehension skills.

63
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,332
Hey, Dae-sung!

64
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,677
Over there!

65
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,262
Or maybe not.

66
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,685
CANDIDATES
OH HUI-JI, SHIN SOL-I, WANG SE-HYEONG

67
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,899
Heon!

68
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,819
-What?
-Who are you going to vote for?

69
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,490
No, don't tell me.

70
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,659
It should be anonymous, so don't.

71
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,910
Okay?

72
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,747
Anyway, I promise to do my best,
so trust me on that.

73
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,252
ELECTION DAY

74
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,967
Ms. Moon and fellow students, hello.

75
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm Shin Sol-i.

76
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,931
I'm fully aware that my candidacy

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,558
shocked many of you

78
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,645
and that many of you think
I'm not qualified.

79
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,523
I don't get good grades,

80
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,942
nor am I a model student.

81
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,946
Also, I'm not a natural born leader
or particularly humorous.

82
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,534
HELLO, I'M SHIN SOL-I…

83
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,328
YOU CAN DO IT!

84
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,206
You've got this!

85
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,750
Go for it!

86
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,135
I easily make mistakes,

87
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,053
and I make lots of clumsy mistakes.

88
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,015
However, that's why

89
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,144
I believe there's room to grow
and improve in the right direction.

90
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,983
We'll be spending the most
important days of our lives together.

91
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,863
When the year is over,
rather than a clumsy troublemaker,

92
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,865
I'd like to be remembered

93
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,493
as your favorite class president
who helped and spoke up for everyone.

94
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,204
I'll do my best!

95
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,968
Here.

96
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,846
Thanks for helping me with my speech.

97
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,805
No, thanks.

98
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,265
Don't refuse. Just take them.

99
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,268
Hui-ji made it for you.
Why let them go to waste?

100
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,314
He accepted it!

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,317
Look, it's the vice president.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,860
She got lucky, if you ask me.

103
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,029
Talk about not knowing your place.

104
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,072
Stop it.

105
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,907
What? Am I wrong?

106
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
What about you?

107
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,288
<i>You</i> should know your place.

108
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,791
It's all right.

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,757
Tell me why you didn't vote for Sol-i.

110
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,345
She's not it.

111
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,853
TWO HOURS AGO

112
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,107
Hui-ji and Sol-i are at a tie.

113
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,611
Ms. Moon, Heon isn't here.

114
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,828
Heon,

115
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,540
who will you vote for?

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,543
Heon, I'm right here.

117
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,795
Don't forget I'm your partner.

118
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,133
Please…

119
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,176
Oh Hui-ji.

120
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,492
Hey, Cha Heon.

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,203
-What?
-Why am I not up to the job?

122
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,663
You're not leader material.

123
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,081
And Hui-ji is?

124
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,459
Compared to you, yes.

125
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,671
Hey!

126
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,344
What? You kicked Heon?

127
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,804
You kicked him hard?

128
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,140
Keep it down, will you?

129
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,726
Wow, Sol-i, I'm really impressed.

130
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,227
You taught him a lesson.

131
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,814
Why am I exhilarated
when you're the one who kicked him?

132
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,318
I don't know what to do right now.

133
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,696
Do you think he'll accept my apology?

134
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,448
Heon, wait up!

135
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,742
No way. I just can't believe it.

136
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,160
Sol-i kicked you?

137
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,538
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

138
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,341
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

139
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,342
What?

140
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,011
-Here you go.
-What's this?

141
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,013
The money for the field day T-shirts.

142
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,140
Hui-ji told me to give it to you.

143
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,475
-Me?
-That's all I know.

144
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,062
She's making you do all the work now.

145
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,482
Ha-young, what do I do?

146
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,942
What else can you do?

147
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,860
It's your job as the vice president.

148
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,113
No, I mean about Heon.

149
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,740
How am I supposed
to ask him to pay the money?

150
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,826
What? Just ask.

151
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,079
Put him in a headlock
and point a gun at him.

152
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,914
"Bang! Pay up."

153
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,668
But he's too tall for me.

154
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,381
Do it when he's seated.
He usually is, anyway.

155
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,803
Okay, one, two, three. One!

156
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,639
-Darn it.
-Hang in there.

157
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,142
You're caving in. Jeez.

158
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,518
Do it!

159
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,398
"Bang! Pay up."

160
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,278
God, that was so cheap.

161
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,487
How about another game?

162
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,990
Hand me my change.

163
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,951
Heon,

164
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,788
Ms. Moon said I should ask you
to recommend some English books,

165
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,415
since you've read a lot.

166
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,376
I want to start reading in English.

167
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,211
What books do you recommend?

168
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,382
-I'll write you a list later on.
-Sure.

169
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,115
Are you done collecting the money?

170
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,117
Ms. Moon wants it by this afternoon.

171
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,412
Sure, got it.

172
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,456
-Let's go.
-Okay.

173
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,066
-What is it?
-Where did it go?

174
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,319
-Try to think.
-Okay.

175
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,366
Hand in your Korean language assignment.

176
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,831
Here.

177
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,166
SHIN SOL-I

178
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,793
This is crazy.

179
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,589
I think it's in my Korean language
notebook.

180
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,510
Then get it back

181
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,345
before Hui-ji and Su-jin find out.

182
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,180
But,

183
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,933
that means
I'll have to go to the staff room

184
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,435
and the person who sits next to Mr. Kim…

185
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>is Mr. Cho.</i>

186
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,192
I won't be able to retrieve it.

187
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,951
KANG HA-YOUNG
SHIN SOL-I

188
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,844
Yes?

189
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,637
What's wrong? Are you sick?

190
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,890
No.

191
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,768
Actually, my stomach hurts.

192
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,021
Really?

193
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,827
Hi, Mr. Lee.

194
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,379
Mr. Lee, my stomach's killing me.

195
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,963
Can I get medicine?

196
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,091
Where does it hurt?

197
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,844
Why don't you show me?

198
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889
Right.

199
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,396
This would be indigestion.

200
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,817
And this would be enteritis.

201
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
Then…

202
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,952
-Do they require different medicine?
-Of course.

203
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,788
The treatment varies
depending on the illness.

204
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,748
So…

205
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,707
And gender too.

206
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,420
Men and women need different medications.

207
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,005
So be more specific.

208
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,263
Then…

209
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,306
consider me a girl.

210
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,780
Thank you!

211
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,866
What do I do?

212
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,829
Here.

213
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,790
Take one.

214
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,589
What?

215
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,924
Take one now.

216
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,110
You lost the money, didn't you?

217
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,738
-No!
-Is that so?

218
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,992
-Forget it, then.
-Heon.

219
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Help me.

220
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,207
-Why should I?
-I'm sorry I kicked you.

221
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,167
I was going to apologize right away.
I mean it.

222
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,294
If you help me,

223
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,047
I'll never forget your kindness.

224
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,467
Where did you lose it?

225
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,721
I put it in the homework notebook
I handed in.

226
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,974
Then…

227
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,605
why don't you go kick Mr. Kim
in the shins, too?

228
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,618
I'm doomed!

229
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,379
I'm sorry, but I'm begging you.

230
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,549
Please don't tell
my classmates about this,

231
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,717
especially Oh Hui-ji and Lee Su-jin.

232
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,011
They can't find out about this.

233
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,847
Please, sir.

234
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,974
What are you doing?

235
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,685
Why are you blocking the door?

236
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,111
STAFF ROOM

237
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,956
Heon, how are you feeling today?

238
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,499
I envy him.

239
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,926
Hui-ji, did you collect the money?

240
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,554
Yes, our vice president has it.

241
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,435
Sol-i, what's wrong?

242
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,819
Ms. Moon, the thing is…

243
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,322
I…

244
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,080
CHA HEON

245
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,356
Sol-i?

246
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,820
Ms. Moon, I apologize.

247
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,740
I lost the money I'd collected,

248
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,243
and Heon's just recovered it for me.

249
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,496
I knew she'd cause trouble.

250
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,956
Sol-i, are you kidding me?

251
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,376
I'm sorry, guys.

252
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,171
I guess I shouldn't be the vice president.

253
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,256
Shouldn't she resign?

254
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,716
She messed up big time.

255
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,719
You think so?

256
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,307
Quiet, everyone.

257
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,352
Anyone can make mistakes.

258
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,938
Even I, your teacher, make mistakes.

259
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,359
However, it's never easy to admit them.

260
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,863
One has to be brave
to openly admit their mistakes.

261
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,491
That is why I believe

262
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,993
what Sol-i just did is incredible.

263
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,041
It's not like the money's gone,

264
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,210
so isn't it all right?

265
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,464
-Right. Don't you agree?
-The money's all there.

266
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,383
That'll do.

Here you go.

270
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,100
Hey, what was that?

271
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,436
Nothing, sir.

272
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,777
Get it together, all right?

273
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,198
You guys are going to be seniors soon.
Got it?

274
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,702
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,732
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

276
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,943
-Shin Sol-i!
-Heon!

<i>-The field day is next week--
-Which has nothing to do with you.</i>

278

<i>Heon, do you know
why she's practicing so hard?</i>

279
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,077
<i>Mr. Lee, is Ha-young
going to be all right?</i>

280
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,078
<i>I have to go now.</i>

281
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
-Is there any way?
-Jump over the gate.

282
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,997
<i>-What are you doing?</i>
-The dean's coming.

283
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,750
How about we meet
at the playground briefly?

284
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,629
<i>-Don't be nervous.
-Heon, will you help me?</i>
