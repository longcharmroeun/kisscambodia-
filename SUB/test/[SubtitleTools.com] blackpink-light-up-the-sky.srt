00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,793
Today is the debut
of YG's newest girl group in seven years.

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,464
Introducing BLACKPINK!

3
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,774
♪ BLACKPINK… ♪

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,030
Please give it up for BLACKPINK!

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,704
Hello, we're BLACKPINK!

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,437
Our next guests are the best-charting

7
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,463
female Korean group of all time.

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
…wildly popular K-pop group…

9
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,135
K-pop sensations, BLACKPINK!

10
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,471
♪ Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du ♪

11
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,292
BLACKPINK has become

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,684
the highest charting
K-pop girl group ever.

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,728
They also made history as they became

14
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,314
the first K-pop girl group
to perform at Coachella.

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,193
Performing it live
for the first time ever on US television,

16
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,361
here is BLACKPINK!

17
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,113
- BLACKPINK!
- BLACKPINK!

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,031
Congratulations, BLACKPINK.

19
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,533
BLACKPINK!

20
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,201
♪ Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du ♪

21
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,977
- I'm so hungry.
- Are you?

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,979
- Did I eat something today?
- No.

23
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,191
There's a dessert.
It's like a croissant with injeolmi.

24
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,526
Ah!

25
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,111
You guys don't like injeolmi?

26
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,780
It tastes really good.

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,825
Says the Thai girl in the car.

28
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,705
Every time a new album comes,
we're just excited. We're like,

29
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,667
"Ah, yay. Finally, one more," you know?

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,962
I think we're halfway there, maybe?

31
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,424
We're always halfway there.
We're like, "We have the songs…

32
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,051
there. We just need to record them."

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,849
Seeing so many people love our music

34
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:08,479
motivates us
to try something new and different.

35
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,149
It's time for us to do some music.

36
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,232
Yeah.

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,321
We just have
so much to show people.

38
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,866
I don't think
we've done something really girly yet.

39
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,827
We've practiced
and explored so many different things,

40
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,747
um, during our trainee days,

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,252
and so it's just a matter of how much
of that we could end up showing

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,378
as BLACKPINK.

43
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,715
I think, for me, when I say girly,
I want to do more like…

44
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,301
like… "Hello…"

45
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,719
Like what?

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,512
Like, ooh…

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,024
Why is that delay
so strong right now?

48
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,525
Can you bring it down a bit?

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,361
Push it forward a bit.

50
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,446
I'm their producer, songwriter.

51
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,075
I've written and produced
every single song that's come out so far.

52
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
It's been about four years now.

53
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,497
Our initial approach was more like…

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,208
single, smash, single, hit.

55
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,379
Now, we feel like we need
to tell more of our personal story.

56
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,882
And I know the fans are mad.
Like, "We want more and more."

57
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,635
We do have a lot in here, but…

58
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,429
we're very particular
with what we put out.

59
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,558
Hello!

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,405
Oppa, you got some
leather jackets going on there?

61
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,273
Awesome!

62
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,608
Stop acting
like I overdressed today.

63
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,152
I always dress like this.

64
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,823
I should've had a nap today.

65
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,618
- I'll slap your wrist. Sleepy right?
- I didn't get a nap.

66
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,744
Ah!

67
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,828
Better?

68
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,607
So, I have the…

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,084
Lady Gaga featuring BLACKPINK
that's about to come out.

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,167

72

73
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,049
We worked hard before New Year's for this.

and they're so successful.

80
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,949
I don't think any
of us even expected this.

81
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
Sometimes it gets to me,
like, "Oh, my God."

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,203

It's addictive.

96

Should we re-record
certain parts of "Crazy Over You"?

99
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,792
Every group has
their own different cultural background

100
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,293
that makes them who they are.

101
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,257
But the combination,
that's what makes BLACKPINK unique

102
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,550
and stand out.

103
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,763
Who thinks
they can nail their part in this song?

104
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,908

Rosé, a Korean girl
that was raised in Australia.

108
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,449
And she stays here 'til, like,
six o'clock a.m. just in the studio.

109
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,701

Jisoo.

113
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,717
Straight-up Korean girl
that grew up in Korea.

114
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,387
She's the unnie of the group.
She's the oldest.

00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,102
She does have
that professional poker face.

117
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,813
I've known Jisoo for,
let's say, a good six years.

118
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,939
I've seen her cry…

119
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,817
once.

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,026
She's super smart.

121
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,612
A lot of people might think
she's book smart,

122
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,322
but I would say she's street smart.

Oh, that scared me.

125
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,620
Lisa, from Thailand.

126
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,373
She's always got that cool, calm,

127
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,834
"it's gonna be okay,
we're all good" smile.

♪ I'm ready for love
I'm ready for love… ♪

129
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,549
But when it comes to certain moments,

130
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,385
when the music starts,
when it's crunch time,

131
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,889
she has this executioner killer instinct.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,061
Jennie, born in Korea,
but moved to New Zealand.

133
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,691
She's super clear.

134
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,235
Her opinions, her emotions.

135
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,862
She's a perfectionist.

136
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,701
All those different cultures in one pot,

137
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,872
it's just different how they walk,
how they talk, and how they dress.

138
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,876
And the perfect balance,
how they complement each other.

139
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,252
It's fascinating.

140
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,633
We're just Korean people
trying to do music,

141
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,468
so if Korean people make music,

142
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,553
it's K-pop? I don't even get it. Like…

143
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,637
It's Korean pop.

144
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,433
The only thing is language.

145
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,978
Why don't they do that
for every country?

146
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,772
What is K-pop?

147
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,732
K-pop.

148
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,527
K-pop is taking the US by storm.

149
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,071
K-pop has become
a worldwide cultural phenomenon.

150
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,115
The genre has been around
for at least two decades.

151
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,994
This is a three-member group
named Seo Taiji and Boys.

152
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,246
Please welcome them.

153
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,090
Powerful rhythm and flash dances

154
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,384
are the hallmarks of Seo Taiji's music.

155
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,262
They sing well, look cool, and dance well.

156
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,978
The interest in Korean pop music
is unusually high from foreigners.

157
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,818
A few big music agencies

158
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,775
began making these polished groups

159
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,652
of singers, rappers, and dancers.

160
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,946
One of the heavy-weight companies

161
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,489
is YG Entertainment.

162
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,159
…responsible
for the insanely viral "Gangnam Style."

163
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,143
The industry
brings in billions of dollars a year.

164
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,962
Grooming these singers
is an industry all in itself.

165
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,381
Trainees can start
as young as 11 years old.

166
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,925
They're raised together.
They train together.

167
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
Perfecting every pitch.

168
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
Mastering every move.

169
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,888
Stakes are high.

170
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,474
Some make their debut
after just a few months' training.

171
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,102
For others, it could be up to a decade.

172
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,396
Many never make it to debut at all.

173
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,160
How many do I have to pick?

174
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,246
Preparing
for a new album, that's definitely fun,

175
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,665
'cause it's like trying
to come up with something new,

176
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,167
but fittings like this,

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,879
it is one of the biggest,
like, creative parts that we do.

178
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,049
Oh, Jisoo!

179
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,843
- Wow… - Oh là là.

180
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,928
You look naturally sexy!

181
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,181
- Really!
- You can't help yourself!

182
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,809
If we wear something,
we all try to see how it fits as a group,

183
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,729
but that's... Well, it's case by case.

184
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,172
It takes a long time.

185
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,651
Shouldn't we make it
a bit tighter? What do you think?

186
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,446
- Because this side goes up.
- Mm-mm-mm.

187
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,864
Okay.

188
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,077
Lalisa. Oh là là!

189
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,038
Lisa! Lalisa!

190
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,748
Oh là là.

191
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,709
Lisa has diverse tastes.

192
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,420
- She can wear whatever.
- She pulls off anything.

193
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,383
It's so hard to define style.

194
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,928
I don't think there's any,
like, boundaries within that.

195
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,516
We don't go, "This is Korean,
and this is Western. This is Asian."

196
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,268
I think fashion
is really just international.

197
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,398
The more that there aren't any boundaries,
I think that's when you can get creative.

198
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,902
And since we do
crazy choreography on stage,

199
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,446
it all has to be
really engineered, basically.

200
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,990
Make sure nothing flops out anywhere.

201
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,200
Yeah.

202
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,215
- What's this?
- Coachella.

203
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,095
I missed my note at the "eh."

204
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,556
See, this is why
we can't watch our old footage.

205
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,559
We're like,
"You missed your note at the 'eh',"

206
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,270
and, "I should've gone slower
at this part of the choreography,

207
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,563
but I did it too quickly."

208
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,440
I missed my note. That wasn't good.

209
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,738
We were so nervous…

210
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,949
Yeah.
If anything, it's stressful.

211
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,411
Sometimes if something's not working,
or I'm not doing my best performance,

212
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,579
it can be stressful.

213
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,664
Compared to other stages,

214
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,500
it was much more overwhelming
because we were so nervous.

215
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:38,174
For us, it was our first time
in a country we weren't familiar with.

216
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,844
I used to dream
of that day when we were trainees.

217
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,971
This is what we wanted.

218
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,056
- This is it.
- This is it.

219
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,729
I always avoid interviews
or any questions about me

220
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,940
because I would rather
not talk about myself, but…

221
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,907

00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,922
Jennie's personality?

227
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,383
At first, it was hard getting to know her,

228
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,718
but once we became close,

229
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,430
I could tell that she's very loyal,
very sweet, and a lovely friend.

230
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,648
I see her every day, so I'm used to her,
and she's like my little sister.

231
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,777
But when I see her on TV,
I'm like, "Ah, Jennie is a star,”

232
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,279
but she's really down-to-earth.

233
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,324
You're doing so well.

234
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,411
She's my friend. One of few that I have.

235
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,250
Slowly.

236
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,585
We're going to lift one leg up
and do an arabesque.

237
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,548
I'm always aching
after tours and stuff.

238
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,758
I feel like, out of all the members,

239
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,845
I'm always sick.

240
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,432
You know, some days,
just like every other human being,

241
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,434
you feel extra happy.

242
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,021
And some other days, you're feeling down.

243
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,608
Singing, dancing, and rapping,
I always enjoy it all the time,

244
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,485
but we always have to be on stage

245
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,573
looking perfect
and performing the same thing.

246
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,325
It's like working out
for two hours every day.

247
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,910
It never gets easy.

248
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,497
Gets harder, actually,
'cause you age.

249
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,377
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

250
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,092
I was born in Korea.

251
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,179
It's just me and my mom.
I'm the only child.

252
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,559
I was raised in Seoul until I was ten.

253
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,897
I went to Australia
and New Zealand to travel with my mom,

254
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,024
and by the time we got to New Zealand,

255
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,901
it was so nice and peaceful.

256
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,613
She asked me,
"How do you feel about living here?"

257
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,949
And I said, "Yeah, I would like that."

258
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,455
So, from ten to 15.
I was in New Zealand by myself.

259
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,959
I never really got to spend
so much time in the house with my mom…

260
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,170
until recently.

261
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,090
I did a homestay.

262
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,219
I got to just run around,
learn so many things.

263
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,225
I understand English

264
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,478
better than when I began.

265
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,523
In the beginning,
my friends helped me a lot

266
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:46,570
and showed me their notes.
Now I can do it by myself.

267
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,283
They have classes in school to go out,

268
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,494
go camping, go learn instruments.

269
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,162
If you want, do art.

270
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,666
Everything was up to you.

271
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,294
Even if you're ten,
you still got to make your own decisions.

272
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,382
That was very important
for me to have at a young age.

273
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,301
That built me as who I am right now.

274
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,223
I am super shy.

275
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,684
I was one of those people
where I can't even

276
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,894
order something on the phone.

277
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
Like, I hated that.

278
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,272
Good work.

279
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,396
Took me a while to get this far.

280
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,360
Ta-da!

281
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:31,699
When I turned 15. I was deciding
whether I should move to America.

282
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:36,412
I went there, I checked the school out.
Everything was kind of decided, like 80%.

283
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,665
And I came back
to New Zealand to pack my stuff up,

284
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,710
and that's when I realized
I don't want to go to America

285
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,212
and do another study there by myself.

286
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,258
I actually want to become a singer.
I don't know where it came from.

287
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,019
As soon as I came back, I did an audition.

288
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,229
And luckily, I got in right away.

289
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,357
I was like, "Wow!
These people are so in to it!"

290
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,485
"They know what they're doing."
I was like, "Let's catch up."

291
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,112
That's all I had in mind.

292
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,825
♪ I only call you

293

00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,747

297

298
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,805
Oh, that’s really long ago.

299
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,677
I used to do a lot
of dark and strong songs.

300
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,098
So I often wonder,
"What am I doing right now?"

301
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,018
It's so different
from what I do now.

302
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,939
Wow!

303
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,609
- Your gestures!
- You're always so cool.

304
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,613
It's sad to say,

305
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,282
the very first group
of people that trained with me,

306
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,367
none of them are here with me right now.

307
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,703
And as soon as Lisa came in,

308
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,580
that's when I thought…

309
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,959
"Wow, there are people born to do this."

My role…
I'm a rapper and also the lead dancer.

317
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
Hello.

318
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,580
Oh, this is cute.

319
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,541
I love vintage clothes.

320
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,084
So wherever I go,

321
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,254
whether it be America or anywhere else,

322
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,464
I try to look for vintage shops.

323
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,384
Oh, wow. Voilà!

324
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,179
This is 1.1 million.

325
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,016
- And this is 320.000.
- And this one?

326
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,685
That's 750.000.

327
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,520
This is 1.1 million?

328
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,564
Yes, because it's from the early '90s.

329
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,647
Oh!

330
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,235
This is so cool!

331
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,447
Can I... Can I get this?

332
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,701
My mom manages my finances.

333
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,914
She's gonna be like,
"No, Lisa, no. Stop shopping for now."

334
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,293
She's always like that,
but I don't really listen to her.

335
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm sorry, Mom.

336
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,963
Whoa!

337
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,049
1997.

338
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,384
When I was born.

339
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,598
I was born in Thailand.

340
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,020
I was born in Buriram Province.

341
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,150
Then I moved to Bangkok when I was three.

342
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:59,406
My auntie had a music group,

343
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:04,161
so they had mic stands,
and I always played with them.

344
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,831
I would lower it
until it was the same height as me.

345
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,417
Then I would just dance
and sing to myself.

346
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,961
That was how my mom knew I loved dancing.

347
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,424
So she signed me up
for a course when I was in kindergarten.

348
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,594
This is behind the scenes.

349
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,180
That was how it all began.

350
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,895
She signed me up to many contests…

351
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,314
…dance competition and stuff.

352
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,068
How long have you
been practicing break dancing?

353
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,653
For a long time.

354
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,740
I participated in a contest.
I was around 12 or 13 years old then.

355
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:47,329
Then a talent scout told me to try singing
and asked if I wanted to be a singer.

356
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,959
Then I realized
that I loved both singing and dancing.

357
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,129
And YG happened
to have an audition at the time.

358
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,506
So, I made a decision.

359
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,800
Okay. I should try, for sure.

360
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,179
Is this an audition?

361
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,223
How many layers are you wearing?

362
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,786
Why are you wearing pants on top too?

363
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,143
- What is this?
- Oh, wow!

364
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,688
- Oh, my God.
- This is amazing.

365
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,605
Wow!

366
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,773
You look so cool.

367
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,692
I'm trying so hard to be cool.

368
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,071
After the audition ended…
…I waited for the call.

369
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,115
I was waiting and waiting.

370
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,908
I waited for the call.

371
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,204
I waited for two months!

372
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:34,084
And then they called me.
I was like, "What? Is this possible?"

373
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,260
I was a mama's girl.

374
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,180
So, when I had to go to Korea without Mom,

375
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,516
I felt that I had
to take care of myself now.

376
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,144
I was 14.

377
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,687
Such a kid.

378
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,027
I didn't speak any Korean.

379
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,325
I only knew how to say "hello,"
so it really was a new start.

380
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,371
♪ I'm in the club

381
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,791
Fortunately, there was Jennie.

382
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,378
♪ In the club

383
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,631

384
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,715
among the trainees.

385
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,093

386

388
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,812
That's it.

389
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,776
However you feel comfortable. Like…

390
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,568
You choose how to sing it
because we're all doing it differently.

A great thing with us

395
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:57,459
is everyone wants the best

00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,382
Okay.

399
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,885
Since we perform as a group,

400
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,512
we try to strike a balance

401
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,222
that works for everyone.

402
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,599

406
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,290
Sit here, Jisoo.

407
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,418
What do you think?

408
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,711
Do you think I'll be able to learn today?

409
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:47,467
I think it’ll be nice to learn
how to draw my eyebrows properly.

410
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,970
If you show me, I'll follow it.

411
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,431
- Okay.
- I'm learning from you today.

412
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,391
Do you teach makeup like this too?

413
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,274
- To regular people? Yes.
- Really?

414
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,246
- There are classes for that?
- Of course!

415
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,313
I should've taken
those classes then.

416
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,524
There are people
who come to learn BLACKPINK makeup.

417
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,984
- BLACKPINK makeup?
- Yes.

418
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,360
When I was younger,

419
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,573
my relatives treated me
like an outcast because I was ugly.

420
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:10,991
What?

421
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,909
They called me a monkey.

422
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,162
It's okay. You're the prettiest one now.

423
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:22,210
I grew up in Sanbon
in Gunpo city, Gyeonggi-do region.

424
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,504
I lived with my parents,

425
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,383
my sister, my brother,
and my grandparents.

426
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm living a very different life

427
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,850
than the one I thought I'd be living.

428
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,769
I used to want to be a writer

429
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,397
or a painter.

430
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,192
Although, I couldn't paint well.

431
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,196
And then I joined
the drama club in 11th grade.

432
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,199
Should I try acting?

433
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,659
They were saying
I should start auditioning for stuff

434
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,578
because I needed the experience.

435
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,165
My first audition was at YG.

436
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,044
I didn't know much at all about YG

437
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,131
before I arrived there the first day.

438
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,552
It felt like something
far removed from me.

439
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,642
I never thought
I'd actually be doing it for real.

440
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,062
How about now?
Do you think I really lost my baby fat?

441
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:26,233
Back then, it was more baby-like here…

442
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,045
I guess I'll just have to eat ramen
before I sleep tonight.

443
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,709
Maybe then you'll get your old self back.

444
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,239
No, you're perfect right now.

445
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,741
Anyways, you were like a baby back then.

446
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,578
But you're different from back then, too.

447
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,914
You have your own shop!

448
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,208
Who told you to open your own shop?

449
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,918
Say it! Who told you to?

450
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,001
You did.

451
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,171
It was my big plan.

452
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,384
And I'm still planning big things.

453
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,930
I think that
there are very few who truly think,

454
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,391
"This is what I have to do.
This is my path."

455
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,059
People like that are really lucky.

456
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,979
I don't think there are many like that.

457
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,755
I have a really hard time falling asleep.

458
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,471
I have a lot of thoughts
running through my head.

459
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,895
And singing is kind of like stress relief,

460
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,149
and everything just kind of makes sense
when I'm doing this.

461
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,765
That's a really hard song.

462
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,520
I didn't think
I could ever perfect that one.

463
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,984
Sometimes,
I actually have missed my trainee days.

464
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,491
Because, back then,
we were surrounded by music all the time.

465
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,827
But these days we've got a lot of work,

466
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,954
so I actually have to make time for this.

467
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,166
That's why it's always at night,
when I'm supposed to be sleeping.

468
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,127
Hi, girls and boys.

469
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,922
I'm called Roseanne…

470
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,341
and I just woke up.

471
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,051
And welcome to Pajama News.

472
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,762
I was born in New Zealand.

473
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:05,183
And then I moved
to Australia when I was eight.

474
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,234
Back then, I was always on the piano.

475
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,529
I'd like sit there,
and I'd play this lullaby for myself,

476
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,323
but I'd be really sleepy,
and I'd fall asleep,

477
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,701
and then I'd put my chin on my knee.

478
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,163
I went to church every Sunday
and had a lot of Korean friends there.

479
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,543
But then at school,
I was just a normal Australian kid.

480
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,963
Congratulations, Rosé.

481
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,382
And I think I enjoyed having two lives.

482
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,343
Kind of like Hannah Montana.

483
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,594
It's funny.

486
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:52,355
My dad saw on the news
that YG was coming to Australia.

487
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,567
He was like,
"Rosé, do you wanna audition?"

488
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,610
And I was so shocked.

489
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,281
I think I asked him,
"Do I like music? Do I?"

490
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,324
And he's like, "Yeah, obviously."

491
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,745
"You're gonna have to,
you know, try do something about it."

492
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,413
"Otherwise you're gonna be 25.

493
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,616

00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,597
Then I went and auditioned,
and then they called me,

498
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,225
and they were like,
"Can you fly to Korea within two months?"

And then my whole life changed.

502
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,529
I dropped out of school.

503
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,283
In Australia, I dropped out of school.

504
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,369
I had never even imagined myself
living apart from my family.

505
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,623
I hadn't even slept
more than two weeks out of home.

506
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,084
It was a really...
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna cry.

507
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,419
It was...

508
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,170
I'm gonna cry.

509
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,506
Yeah.

510
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,804
The first night in the dorm,

511
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,639
they were all in the same room.

512
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,140
Everybody was sleeping.

513
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,813
She brought a guitar
from Australia, and I was like,

514
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,273
"Play something for us."

515
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,442
It was us four.
I don't even know why,

516
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,610
but it was us four.

517
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,570
We covered songs 'til morning.

518
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,114
All four of us, we were singing.
Somebody was harmonizing.

519
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,616
I think Jisoo was harmonizing.

520
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,786
It was so funny. Can you believe it?

521
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,037
My eyes.

522
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,206
My eyes.

523
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,584
- It's really pretty.
- Wow!

524
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,711
Here, stand here.

525
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,713
One, two…

526
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,344
- Nice.
- I wanna have a look.

527
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,392
After my Korean classes
on the fifth floor,

528
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,855
I took the elevators to the basement.

529
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,481
And there was this girl

530
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,067
with short hair, tied back.

531
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,487
It was kind of awkward.

532
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,782
- I was nervous.
- I'm sure you were nervous.

533
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,741
So weird.

534
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,827
I was like, "Oh! A new girl?"

535
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,538
I was like… so wary of competition.

536
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,225
- Right. Competition.
- Competition, it's so competitive.

537
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,310
Everything was
gyeongjaeng at that time.

538
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,961
She thought I was competition,

539
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,629
and I was just really intimidated.

540
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,590
Like, everybody is so good.

541
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,800
We were the same age,

542
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,052
and we had similar tastes.

543
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,638
Since we both came from another country,

544
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,932
we relied on each other
when we were having a hard time.

545
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,436
We become like two peas in a pod.

546
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,646
We were like genuine twins.

547
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,107
We have so many days where we walk out,

548
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,609
and we're wearing the same thing.

549
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,905
And during our days off,
we'd always be together.

550
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,741
She started getting an Australian accent.

551
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,493
See, she still has it sometimes.

552
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,786
No.

553
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,954
- Yeah.
- No.

554
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,040
I don't even know how to say...

555
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,584
I never knew I would live in Korea.

556
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,669
Then all of a sudden at 16. I'm like…

557
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,297
Now Korea is my home.

558
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,882
Was it hard for you?

559
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,216
Of course.

560
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,969
Even though you have me?

561
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,054
You?

562
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,138
You're not any help.

563
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,765
I'm joking.

564
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,893
- Yeah, 'cause I grew up with a sister.
- Mm.

565
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,561
Think about not having a sister.

566
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,854
But Lisa was there.

567
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,368
When I was having a hard time,

568
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,400
I'd look at Rosé, and she'd be the same.

569
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,684
I thought I was really sad,
but I'd look at you, and I'd go, "Okay."

570
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:39,540
I think what makes K-pop K-pop
is the time that we spend as a trainee.

571
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,255
We all live together,
sort of like a boarding school,

572
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,590
like a training version.

573
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,594
I think there were nine girls.

574
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,014
They were planning
on creating a big group,

575
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,517
so they had a lot of girls there.

576
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,854
They need you to be at their standard

577
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,148
in every single subject.

578
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,610
For me, there were
so many lessons in the beginning.

579
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,407
I took three to four dancing lessons a day
and practiced.

580
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,077
I had vocal lessons
from two to three teachers.

581
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,954
It was a rough time.

582
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,666
We'd get a day off every fortnight,

583
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,586
and then practice again
for another 13 days.

584
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,007
So 14 hours a day just training.

585
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,302
♪ Look at y'all lookin' ass hittas
Stop lookin' at my ass, ass hittas… ♪

586
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,679
It's not easy,

587
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,764
the repetition.

588
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:43,146
But at such a young age, they are able
to absorb all the techniques and the tools

589
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,940
that they need for their next ten years.

590
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,902
There's this basic routine
you have to learn in dancing.

591
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,655
Jennie was like, "The first thing
you have to learn is that,

592
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,615
and I'll just teach you the first moves."

593
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,077
And she was like, "Do this."
And I was like, "I don't know how."

594
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,248
I can still remember the first day
that you had a dance lesson.

595
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,209
'Cause I'd never danced in my life.

596
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,753
It was cute.

597
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,547
If you ask a 16-year-old
to dance for the first time,

598
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,758
it's the funniest thing. I looked like a…

599
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,930
And then after that,
I got so angry at myself.

600
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,017
I was like,
"I am going to become like Lisa."

601
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,937
'Cause Lisa was the dancer.
She was like… She was at the top.

602
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,861
At the end of every month,
our boss and all the producers would come,

603
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,197
and we'd perform a solo song,

604
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,533
a group song, and a group choreography.

605
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,179
For that,
we'd have to plan everything ourselves,

606
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,370
but we each had a role.

607
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,251
If someone was in charge of vocals,
we'd give them that role,

608
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,505
but I always took on
the role of the dancer.

609
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,716
So I'd always design the choreography.

610
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,178
Every month! Literally every month

611
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,261
for five years.

612
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,351
After a monthly review,
you would be graded.

613
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,146
You had those who got an A,
those with Bs and those with Cs.

614
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,607
I remember having to send

615
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,110
a good friend of mine home every month

616
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,488
because they got eliminated from the test.

617
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,991
There were so many rules,
so many things to just be like,

618
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,075
"Okay, they don't like this.
They don't like that."

619
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,454
Everything that I did was wrong.

620
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,708
Being told
that I'm not good at stuff face-to-face

621
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,961
and trying to keep everything together

622
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,463
when I hear those things…

623
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,924
It's really harsh.

624
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,385
It wasn't a very happy vibe.

625
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:42,306
We're not allowed to drink,
or smoke, or get a tattoo.

626
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,812
I rarely went home
and had to practice on the weekends.

627
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,315
So my parents
were quite upset and worried.

628
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,070
But they're not really…

629
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,199
the protective, overbearing type,

630
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,161
and they knew
this was something that I had to do,

631
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:09,750
so they told me

00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:18,509
…and I would always call her
and tell her, "Mom, it's so hard."

634
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,803
She'd say, "Come home." I'd say, "No."

635
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,806
My dad sent me,
and he was like, "Rosé, come home."

636
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,933
He's like, "We want you back home."

637
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,811
And I hated that. I hated it
whenever they would say, "Come home."

638
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,605
That was the last thing I wanted to hear.

I started a bit later than the others,

642
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:46,245
so I was able to make memories
with friends and go to school.

643
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,082

I don't regret spending time
as a trainee, learning how to dance,

646
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,092
how to sing.

647
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:06,015
But one thing I wish
is to maybe have lived at home

648

until I was like 18. 19.

649

A lot of people make lots of memories
as a high school student.

650
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,026
But I never had that.

651
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,282
Waiting was the hardest part.

652
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,786
I didn't think I would make it.
I was on the verge of letting it go.

653
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,206
It was just days on end
with just a bunch of girls

654

not knowing where this was going.

655
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,542
I'd ask myself,

"Do you want to give up
because it's not easy?"

659
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,427
I'm like, "I'm gonna get through it,

I'm not gonna go back
without doing anything.

664
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,944

into different groups
every other month just to see.

671
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,220
And there was a point
where he pointed the four of us out.

672
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,435
We were evaluated together,

673
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,815
and the four of us did screen tests

674
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,485
and recorded demos together.

675
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,950
It happened naturally.

00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,839
Because usually there's like,
"Oh, I wanna sing more."

681
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,508
Or, "Oh, I wanna be in the middle."

682
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,762
There's always those little fights
going on in the groups.

683
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,223
But when it was the four of us,
it was clear what we were doing.

684
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,728
And that's what made it possible
for us to be in a group.

there were seven, eight, nine girls.

695
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,941
Then we started cutting some songs,

696
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,111
and sonically,
whatever that sounded the best.

697
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,571
The four girls right now, the combination.

698
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,449
And of course
you start looking at their individuality,

If somebody did something
with Teddy or met with Teddy…

703
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:33,973
…it was considered
to be a big deal.

704
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,770
I didn't know much about him.

705
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,814
I knew he was a 1TYM member.

706
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,319
It's a different time,

707
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,866
and I just wanted to become
someone that I needed when I was young.

708
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,077
I didn't have somebody
that's a little more outside looking in,

709
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,579
telling me where to go.

710
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,839
The first time we met was when...

711
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,975
When I was a trainee.

712
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,542
I was so nervous.

713
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,127
I couldn't really talk to him.

714
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,174
Meeting you
was like the final stage of the debut.

715
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,093
You were the final boss.
If we meet you, we get to debut.

716
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,677
You're right.

717
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,890
Oppa, do you remember…

718
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,093
how we had to record
that whistling sound 1.000 times?

719
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,479
That I'll never forget.

720
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,813
I cannot forget that.

721
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,318
And we almost didn't come out
with "Whistle" for our debut song, but...

722
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,161
Too many people
thought it was risky.

723
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,363
But last minute,
we were like, "It has to be that one."

724
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,741
'Cause it has
this weird country vibe to it,

725
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,201
and it's super minimal.

726
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,328
It just sounded
too empty for a lot of people.

727
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,498
Most people were against it.
We just pushed forward, whatever.

728
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,750
Hey, you know that photo there?

729
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,128
That's our very first photo session
as BLACKPINK.

730
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,296
Yeah.

731
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,089
It's oppa's favorite photo.

732
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,968
As soon as I saw that photo,
how it turned out, I was like,

733
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,803
"Oh, this is gonna be fun."

735
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,275

in seven years since 2NE1 debuted.

736
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,444
Under the direction of producer Teddy,

737
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,780
this new group is being prepared.

738
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,867
Its members and debut songs
have been shrouded in secrecy.

739
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,578

740
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,497

743
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,302
All I wanted
was people to see the potential in us.

744
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,767
It didn't necessarily have to be,
"Wow! This group came out,

745
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
and they're so perfect
in every single way."

746
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,481
Like, I wanted people
to be curious about us.

747

754
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,083
and finally being able
to debut on this stage,

755
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,793
I'm nervous and excited.

756
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,546
In the future,
we will work hard to show everyone

00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,849

who's performing next?

766
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,475

00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,649
has reached number one
only 14 days after their debut,

775
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:15,110
which is the shortest time ever
by a girl group to reach number one.

776
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,488
I remember making our debut

00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,615
and winning awards.

778
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,080
Wow!

780
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,133
"Whistle" kept going up and up,
and when it hit number one,

781
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,177
we were just so happy and excited.

782
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,601
Honestly, I think I was most surprised

783
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,729
when "Whistle" reached number one
on the music charts.

784
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,231
That was the most exciting.

785
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,583
I remember we were…

786
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,727
…in a practice room
when we heard the news

787
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,902
that we were number two.

788
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,613
I kept on checking and checking,
but we had to go to practice.

789
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
We'd check every hour.

790
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,658
And then someone came in
and said, "Oh, my God!"

791
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,326
We jumped up and down.

792
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,930
I remember my friends
telling me that they heard it.

793
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,707
They were like, "I'm outside,
and they're playing your song!"

794
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,250
It felt really weird back then.

795
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,670
I was like, "Oh, my God, that's so cool!
Shoot a video! Send me the video!"

796
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,303
Lisa! I love you!

797
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,514
I just really like their style.

798
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,016
Their sound is super different
from other K-pop groups.

799
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,203
It's 'cause they have
so many foreign members,

800
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,938
and it really shows
how anyone can achieve their dreams.

801
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,989
They own the stage when they're on it.

802
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,652
Their dance is so powerful.

803
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:43,073
When their music is played,
you just instantly start dancing.

804
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,992
They have the strongest
friendship I've seen in a K-pop group.

805
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,790
You can see they love
what they are doing and are born to do it.

806
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,634
I felt like this is a girl group

807
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,335
that I can actually vibe with.

808
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,579
You know, they cool.

809
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,764
They the baddest bitches alive.

810
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,355
When I was a trainee,
nobody knew about me.

811
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,858
But after I debuted as BLACKPINK,

812
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,111
everyone would follow me
no matter where I went.

813
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,740
I didn't know
that we would become this famous.

814
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,328
How much did you sleep last night?

815
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,537
Three hours.

816
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,941
- Three hours?
- Yup.

817
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:38,295
- Clear in front.
- Everybody get out.

818
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,591
During trainee days,
I was desperate. I really wanted it.

819
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,970
But after debut, that's when you start
getting a lot of responsibilities.

820
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,972
Everybody look into the camera.

821
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,186
Then came the pressure for our next thing.

822
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,730
"What now? What do we do?"

823
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,109
"Let's come up with something fresh."
I felt like we were being chased.

824
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,353
Action!

825
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,120
The winner is BLACKPINK!

826
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,760
Thank you! I love you all!

827
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,064
It's a big day for BLACKPINK

828
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,774
as "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" has become

829
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,486
the most viewed Korean music video
in 24 hours.

830
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,947
Three music videos
with over 400 million views.

831
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,616
One billion views on YouTube.

832
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,545
I think when things get faster,

833
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,382
it also becomes
very overwhelming at some points.

834
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,009
Yeah.

835
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,018
I still remember the first time…

836
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,070
I went back to Thailand after my debut.

837
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,866
Because Thai teens see me
as a Thai who has made it this far.

838
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,535
They would say, "I want to be like Lisa."

839
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,163
Lisa!

840
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,497
WELCOME HOME LISA WE MISSED YOU

841
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,628
But at that moment,

842
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,214
I wasn't sure if I was really good enough
to be their role model.

843
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,467
I'm a singer…

844
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:53,805
but I didn't know
what kind of singer I wanted to be.

845
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:58,727
I kind of lost the goal.
I was trying to find myself.

846
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,316
Could I really become their role model?

847
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,569
What should I do to not let them down?

848
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,949
These kinds of thoughts
kept running through my mind.

849
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,007
We need sugar.

850
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,759
We need sugar.

851
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,678
- One spoon.
- One spoon.

852
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,180
You like this too.
Tanghulu is different.

853
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,350
Tanghulu has
the sweetness of the fruits.

854
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,144
The ratio is a little off
because we haven't made it in a while.

855
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,605
- There was too much sugar.
- It's a bit burnt.

856
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,941
- It still looks delicious.
- Yeah.

857
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,486
This is actually
a Chinese traditional snack,

858
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,197
but it's hard to find it here in Korea.

859
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,616
We almost started a fire once.

860
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,452
- We were making too much.
- Yeah, we almost burnt it.

861
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,122
We almost made
this dorm disappear.

862
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,838
This is a way
of me teaching Jisoo to speak English.

863
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,253
She got better in the last six months.

864
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,257
She understands everything that I say,
so I do talk to her in English sometimes.

865
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,844
- How is it?
- Mm.

866
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,303
Is it good? I want a taste.

867
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,887
It's warm.

868
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,891
It's a bit burnt.

869
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,559
Mm!

870
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,895
Not bad.

871
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,649
Not bad but not good.

872
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,694
Yeah. Let's be honest. It was a fail.

873
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,611
Yes.

874
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,488
No. We didn't add any water.

875
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,826
- What are you talking about?
- No, you don't add water.

876
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,120
Unnie! You add water.

877
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,748
You add water? No, you don't add water.

878
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,001
What am I going to do about you?
Nothing works without me.

879
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,962
In Korea,
one of the first things you ask,

880
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,881
other than your name, is how old are you?

881
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,968
And as soon as they say they're older,
it's like, "Oh, you're unnie."

882
00:50:55,052 --> 00:51:00,682
So, unnie is basically
what you call an older sister.

883
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,726
It's like...

884
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,120
Other places don't have it.

885
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,646
We don't call each other by names.

886
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,066
It's normally unnie
if you're older than me,

887
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,984
and oppa if you're a guy.

888
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:16,406
It takes a while to get used to,
but once you get a hold of it,

889
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,742
it's better than calling their names.

890
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,161
She's not Jisoo. She's unnie.

891
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,371
It's like family, in a way.

892
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:28,585
When I first came to train as a singer,

893
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,089
I had never tried
singing or dancing before.

894
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,634
I was lost, but you taught me a lot.

895
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:40,347
For two of us, it was...
The competition was fierce at the time.

896
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,933
There were about 20 to 30 trainees.

897
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,019
Because we are
the older ones of the group,

898
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,522
the others came to us
with the issues they were having.

899
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:53,193
I knew what their problems were.
They'd ask us, "Unnie, what should we do?"

900
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,030
And I'd advise them to speak their mind,
but they have a hard time doing that,

901
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,949
so I end up taking care of it.

902
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,663
There's no doubt
I feel a sense of responsibility.

903
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,374
I try the best I can
to take care of the other girls.

904
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,049
It's okay, actually. I could eat this.

905
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,427
Semi-success.

906
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,432
Okay.
It's just Rosé and the beat.

907
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,852
- Oh, my God!
- No words, no melody whatsoever.

908
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,936
So here we go.

909
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,317
♪ Can't sleep at night ♪

910
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,780
♪ But would it be all right ♪

911
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,659
♪ If I stay, if I… ♪

912
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,788
♪ No, it shouldn't be a problem
No, it shouldn't be a problem ♪

913
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,144
You know how
when people say they're afraid of heights

914
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,544
or they're afraid of water?

915
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:57,215
I've always been so afraid of getting
in the studio or writing something.

916
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:02,220
I always thought just someday
I have to just start it. I have to.

917
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,495
- I'm gonna still keep this one.
- Okay.

918
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,147
- Let's try one more time.
- Okay.

919
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,150
Do I change the rhythm?
I keep going for the same thing.

920
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,361
- Do you feel uncomfortable singing it?
- Do I feel uncomfortable singing it?

921
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,531
Like slightly.
Maybe I'll try singing it one more time.

922
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,784
I've seen Joe a few times,
and his music's like amazing.

923
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:29,789
I was just like, to Teddy,
"What do you think if he helps me out?"

924
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:34,377
So here's what we worked on.
This is Rosé's first recorded song.

925
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,756
We even saved this whole file
in this secret folder

926
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,552
because I said nobody can listen to it.
I was like, "Hide it from everyone."

927
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,557
♪ Wouldn't be a problem
No, it shouldn't be a problem ♪

928
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:53,563
When it comes to writing songs,
Rosé has certain stories in mind.

929
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,942
And she's shy about sharing that story.

930
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,069
It's just super personal to her.

931
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,946
It's like her diary.

932
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,324
Oh, my gosh!

933
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,576
You sounded nervous in that one.

934
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,162
Yeah. I'm like,
"I don't know what I'm doing."

935
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,082
I was thinking
it'd be fun if I write something like…

936
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,126
♪ After two, three o’clock… ♪

937
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,964
♪ When I call you ♪

938
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,676
♪ And when you see my call… ♪

939
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,053
Something like that.

940
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,515
- I think it's fine.
- I want to hide right now.

941
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,352
- No.
- I don't think I can do this.

942
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,492
Teddy told me yesterday too.

943
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,524
He was like, "You need to learn
how to be more vulnerable in the studio."

944
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,151
That's something I can't do too easily,

945
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,403
but I was gonna say...

946
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,030
- I mean, it takes time.
- Yeah.

947
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,366
I really have a lot of respect for music,

948
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,286
so I don't wanna be
just like another girl who sings

949
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,830
and just kind of tells everybody
that she writes music.

950
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,373
That's the last thing I wanna be.

951
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,459
- Whoa, I need one of these.
- Yeah.

952
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,753
Oh, my gosh.

953
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,007
I feel more intimidated
when I'm by myself.

954
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,591
When I'm in my room by myself,

955
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,719
and I go,
"Should I try and write something?"

956
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,762
I think I'm way more intimidated then.

957
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,890
'Cause it's just me.
I don't know if my opinions are right,

958
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,974
and that scares me.

959
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,768
I feel like I scare myself the most.

960
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,355
Okay, let's record that.

961
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,732
What's our tempo?

962
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:23,737
I found these chords
maybe like a month ago.

963
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,281
I was like... I liked it.
I was like, "This sounds cool."

964
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,158
And ever since then, I just play it.

965
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,161
If anything, I was gonna put you
in the booth and sing over it.

966
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,244
Okay.

967
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,497
Do you think I could do it?
I've never tried this.

968
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,083
I think you can do it.
Let's just give it a try.

969
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,052
It's nice to have just the right amount
of people in the room,

970
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,971
who are just there
to accept whatever is there

971
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,431
and make it into something.

972
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:59,439
Joe always says, "This is the safe ground.
Everything's a secret in here."

973
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,024
"You can make a fool out of yourself,

974
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,692
and we won't tell anyone."

975
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,195
Ah.

976
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,657
It feels just like expressing myself.

977
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,995
Whereas I would always
sing songs of other artists.

978
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,582
That's more like borrowing
their emotions and making it mine.

979
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:22,170
Whereas this is totally
just speaking from my point of view.

980
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,311
I'm almost like a baby
trying to speak in the music,

981
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,482
trying to sing… for the first time.

982
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,199
- I lost it again.
- We got it.

983
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,675
Lisa,
should I wear this on my way back?

984
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,093
Kuma!

985
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,471
BLACKPINK hoodie?

986
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,182
- I think you should.
- Right?

987
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,186
Hello. Ah, ow! You just bit me.

988
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,814
Coco bit me. Ah!

989
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,190
Coco like, "I don't care."

990
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,074
I have so many clothes,
but there's not enough space,

991
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,154
so I keep them on the balcony.

992
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,115
Don't we have to pack
for the event in Japan?

993
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,617
You have to bring
something like this. It's cold.

994
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,579
- Bring a scarf too.
- Oh, I don't have a scarf!

995
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,664
- Give me one.
- You are funny.

996
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,083
- Give me one.
- I can't.

997
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,877
That's not a scarf.

998
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,088
It is so tiring when we work,

999
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,258
but when we don't work,
I get stressed out about not working.

1000
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,594
I think it's that. It's a dilemma.

1001
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,221
When we work, I really want to rest,

1002
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,058
but when we don't work,
I end up wondering, "What am I doing?"

1003
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,437
This job has a lot of ups and downs.

1004
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,200
There's nothing we can do about it.

1005
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:09,819
It's very random,
and there's no regularity.

1006
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:15,074
The thing is, you can never tell
how long this will last,

1007
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,911
so estimating is impossible.
That's most challenging.

1008
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,164
This year has been on the road.

1009
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:25,960
This year has been pack and unpack,
and unpack and pack and unpack.

1010
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,044
That's a song.

1011
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,927
At least right now,
we're prepared enough

1012
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,720
to plan the resting part,

1013
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,848
'cause last year,
we were just like spending time like…

1014
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,725
And then the tour hit us,

1015
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,185
and we're like, "Oh, my God."

1016
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,268
Yeah.

1017
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:52,153
I think we were together for three years

1018
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,822
before we went on the world tour.

1019
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,661
It was a long tour, about nine months.

1020
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:03,164
We started the world tour in Asia,

1021
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:09,087
but Coachella marked the start
of our tour in North America.

1022
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,090
When they said that we're gonna

1023
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,007
start going outside of Asia,

1024
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,801
that was like a dream.

1025
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,929
And blow them kisses here and stuff,

1026
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:21,349
because you're coming out
during the chorus before you kiss.

1027
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,559
Oh, the next chorus?

1028
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,811
You're coming out
during the chorus before you kiss.

1029
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,574
You want me
to come out before that chorus?

1030
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,939
Come out slowly and play here.

1031
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,358
It was getting boring
when you stay out there for too long.

1032
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:37,282
A much more diverse group of fans

1033
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,242
will be looking forward to seeing us.

1034
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,120
We wanted
to bring them the best show possible.

1035
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,833
Whether it be
"Playing With Fire" or "Boombayah"…

1036
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,465
you don't look like
you're dancing hard enough.

1037
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,879
- We're not dancing hard enough?
- Not hard enough.

1038
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:57,302
The audience needs
to be mesmerized by your energy, up close.

1039
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,597
I know that you guys know the dance well,
but put in a bit more effort.

1040
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,640
Jisoo, you need to get the notes right.

1041
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,976
You messed up
on the rhythm before, right? Too fast?

1042
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,353
I practiced with MR
for the first time when I got here.

1043
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,999
The notes are
a bit unstable when you first go in.

1044
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,317
But we shouldn't have said that on camera.

1045
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,568
Hey…

1046
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,404
They'll never air this.

1047
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:24,162
The media says
that K-pop queens have landed.

1048
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,415
BLACKPINK, welcome to Thailand. Yay!

1049
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:32,503
Girl group BLACKPINK heat up
their first world tour stop, Thailand.

1050
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:40,094
It's special to have a concert
in Lisa's hometown.

1051
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:48,061
This is the first concert
where BLACKPINK has been able

1052
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,979
to meet our Thai fans.

1053
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,857
We will do our very best
and will not disappoint the BLINKS.

1054
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,859
BLACKPINK!

1055
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,081
I want to give a performance

1056
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,875
that I can look at and be content with.

1057
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,087
My focus is leaving the stage
having given a performance

1058
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,463
I have no regrets about.

1059
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:21,844
So when I get out there,
I'm thinking, "Don't mess this up."

1060
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,707
"You've got to nail this."

1061
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:46,077
Since it was our very first world tour,

1062
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,954
it's amazing to see all these fans

1063
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,040
filling up the big arenas
that we didn't expect.

1064
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:57,547
Everything was new to me on my first tour.

1065
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,467
It was so great
to meet so many fans around the world.

1066
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,730
Once it gets going,
for, like, the next 30 days,

1067
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:17,692
to try to give them the best stage
every day is a lot of pressure.

1068
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:29,954
After so many plane rides
and so many environment changes,

1069
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,039
our body just gives up on us.

1070
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:39,756
- It feels like it's sprained.
- Is it worse on this side?

1071
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,421
When I'm home, I like to workout

1072
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,885
and take care of my body

1073
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,887
'cause I'm like a grandma.
I'm sick everywhere.

1074
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,722
Honestly, I need to take care of myself.

1075
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,517
I lose breath a little easier
than other people,

1076
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,687
and I can't jump as much as other people.

1077
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,985
I think, at first,
I didn't know what I was headed towards.

1078
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,820
Okay. Let's go.

1079
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,574
I thought it would all be
just really exciting and fun.

1080
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,581
I’m going to eat it without ketchup.

1081
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:19,462
In the middle of it,
I didn't feel like I had a personal life.

1082
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,131
It felt like there was
this big hole in my life.

1083
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,550
What I'm basically living for
is tomorrow's show.

1084
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,349
I love being on stage
because that's when I feel the most alive,

1085
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,476
yet when we come back to the hotel,

1086
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,144
I felt so empty.

1087
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:41,359
I'm hungry,
so I ordered something simple.

1088
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,904
Poached eggs. Ta-da!

1089
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,203
And that's when I realized I'm homesick.

1090
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,080
Delicious.

1091
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,254
Yeah! Let's go!

1092
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,883
Lisa is the most constant one.

1093
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,345
She brings positive energy into the group.

1094
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:14,350
If someone is fed up one day…

1095
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,398
…she makes that person laugh.

1096
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,109
She keeps us energized.

1097
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,713
Sometimes I feel like…

1098
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,950
…I think I overreact a lot.

1099
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:35,288
Or I tend to try
to bring too much positivity

1100
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,456
when the mood is sour.

1101
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,518
- But it really helps.
- Really?

1102
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,751
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1103
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,378
I'll keep doing that.

1104
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:46,465
- Keep going.
- Yeah, keep going, Lisa!

1105
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,762
How we stay tight as a group

1106
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,223
is we try to take care
of ourselves individually,

1107
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,936
and then come together healthy
and happy so that the whole thing works.

1108
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:04,817
Sometimes, when I look like
I'm really tired and angry,

1109
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,904
that is my happy face.

1110
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:13,993
We're all human, and we're ladies,
so we have our moments.

1111
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,830
But when you have
the good positive energy going on,

1112
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,165
it helps.

1113
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:29,383
Los Angeles, what's up?
We're BLACKPINK on 97.1 AMP radio.

1114
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,137
You guys,
the first female Korean group

1115
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,221
to perform at Coachella.

1116
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,807
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

1117
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,311
The K-pop girl band called BLACKPINK

1118
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,896
is in the US this weekend.

1119
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,523
Because it's such a big festival,

1120
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,442
when I was told that we were going,

1121
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:47,652
I couldn't believe it.

1122
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:52,573
Are we going to Coachella?
BLACKPINK? Are you sure?

1123
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,367
Is this for real?

1124
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,621
Look over there!

1125
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,749
I'm so excited. This is cool!

1126
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,001
It was really nerve-wracking.

1127
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:08,422
We're a group
from South Korea representing our country.

1128
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,300
We were just
so ready to tell the world

1129
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,177
that we've been waiting for this.

1130
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,390
Since we don't have much time…

1131
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,100
…we're gonna skip "Stay,"

1132
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:22,395
and we're gonna go
from "Whistle" and "Kiss and Make Up."

1133
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:27,650
I was so nervous because I didn't know

1134
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,611
how our American fans would react.

1135
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,490
Usually, a BLACKPINK tour

1136
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,451
is filled with fans who come to watch us,

1137
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,831
but people who come to Coachella
are just people who love music in general.

1138
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,834
I personally was really worried
that not many people

1139
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,877
would walk up to our show.

1140
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,755
I didn't even think we would have,

1141
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,843
I don't know,
100 people or 200 people at least.

1142
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,595
I was just hoping
to have somebody watching us.

1143
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,767
I was so sick.

1144
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,646
That was the sickest I've ever been.

1145
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,942
My back was killing me. It hurt to move.

1146
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:14,321
- I was pretty worried.
- We were very worried.

1147
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,287
Break a leg.

1148
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,810
We're following Coachella.

1149
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,206
Let's go.

1150
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,347
When I got onto that stage,

1151
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,508
I actually didn't realize
that there were so many people.

1152
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,513
Why are there so many people?

1153
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,723
I don't know.

1154
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,308
There are so many people.

1155
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:50,357
- We can do it.
- We can do it. It's fine.

1156
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,234
One, two, three! Go!

1157
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,028
Jennie and Rosé, that way.

1158
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,072
Water, water, water!

1159
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,034
Eye drops, somebody!

1160
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,369
Relax.

1161
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,331
We're starting now!

1162
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:14,590
I was so nervous.
The moment I stepped foot on the stage

1163
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:19,595
and saw all the crowds
shouting and cheering…

1164
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:27,394
…I got the feeling, "This is it!"

1165
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:29,730
♪ BLACKPINK! ♪

1166
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,566
♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah ♪

1167
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,753
I think Coachella
was the moment where I felt like

1168
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,549
there are people that understand
that this isn't just K-pop music.

1169
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:02,638
They see us as doing something new,
and I really like that.

1170
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:17,319
All races and all kinds
of people came together there.

1171
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,156
So it helped emphasize…

1172
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,949
…this represents BLACKPINK.

1173
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,171
I'm happy to be in an era

1174
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:39,175
where people are open
to new culture, new music.

1175
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,385
Who would have imagined, at Coachella,

1176
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,470
thousands of people singing in Korean…

1177
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,681
"- Playing with fire"? - What?

1178
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,730
♪ My love is on fire ♪

1179
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,441
♪ Now burn, baby, burn ♪

1180
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,529
It doesn't matter
the size of the audience.

1181
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,532
It just matters
if it's the right atmosphere.

1182
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,534
Everybody's on the same vibe.

1183
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,843
This was a moment
where I felt really satisfied

1184
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,428
with our work.

1185
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,433
Like all those
training years were worth it!

1186
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:41,946
It makes me feel that…
I had chosen the right path.

1187
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,865
This was what
I really wanted to do in my life.

1188
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,500
We had so much fun.

1189
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,169
I think I'll remember today
for the rest of my life.

1190
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,296
We love you guys!

1191
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,548
- Thank you, guys!
- Thank you so much.

1192
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,014
Goodnight!

1193
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:16,105
There's been lots of news
coming from Coachella,

1194
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,108
but one group
that has everybody talking is BLACKPINK.

1195
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:23,112
If you didn't know who they were before,
you definitely know who they are now.

1196
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:28,450
After Coachella, I think I figured out

1197
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,704
how to have fun on stage.

1198
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,872
Don't concentrate on just yourself,

1199
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,125
but feed off this passion
raging around you.

1200
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,670
Have fun. Have fun with this.

1201
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,026
It doesn't matter if we grow old

1202
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,902
and get replaced
by a new younger generation.

1203
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,572
As long as there is still
someone talking about us.

1204
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,450
Because they will still remember
how we shone so bright.

1215
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,119
We all have dreams, hunger to make it.

1216
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,206
When you're really invested
in what you do,

1217
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:59,416
that's what makes things happen.

1218
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,512
We love you, Bangkok!

1219
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:13,305
Thank you so much!

1220
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,894
Thank you.

1221
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,651
Sadly, very, very extremely sadly,

1222
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,734
um…

1223
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:31,865
Like we said before,
this will be our last concert

1224
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,742
on this tour.

1225
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,161
And I feel like all four of us,

1226
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,788
we did really well,

1227
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,666
and I'm very proud
of each and every one of us.

1228
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,751
'Cause we went through a lot.

1229
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:47,965
Like, I know you guys only see
the stuff that's on stage,

1230
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:50,843
but I feel like
we all go through so much else…

1231
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,636
…and I'm very proud.

1232
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,137
Aw!

1233
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,270
During the shows,
we're always looking out

1234
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,854
and talking to the audience.

1235
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,017
Then I was talking,
and I kinda looked at my members,

1236
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,899
and I was like, "Ah!"
Then I started crying.

1237
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,069
Because it felt like
the first time talking to, you know, each.

1238
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:14,700
Like, I feel like it's so hard
that everybody stays away from home…

1239
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,244
Happy tears.

1240
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,830
- Happy tears.
- Happy tears. It's okay.

1241
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,711
And every time we're in Thailand,
I get really emotional.

1242
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,005
I don't know why.

1243
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,468
- Now I'm gonna cry. I don't want to cry.
- Everybody's gonna cry.

1244
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:36,638
- Everyone, cry.
- Everyone, cry!

1245
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,139
Aw!

1246
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,351
So, it's like a train.
It's me and then Jennie unnie.

1247
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,729
And if she cries,
then Lisa cries, and then…

1248
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,231
I don't cry.

1249
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,193
I don't cry. I cry last.

1250
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,911
Thank you so much for coming. Bye!

1251
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,037
Bye.

1252
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,584
Watch your step. Be careful.

1253
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,086
Good work!

1254
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,170
Bye!

1255
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,804
A fan?

1256
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,477
I'm very proud
of what we've created as BLACKPINK.

1257
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:32,819
We grew into something
that we didn't even know was possible.

1258
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:37,324
And as much as fans
are surprised with the outcome,

1259
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,326
we are as well.

1260
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,996
And so, it feels like a journey
that they're on with us.

1261
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,167
Bye-bye!

1262
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,771
When somebody asks me,
"Do you have pressure about it?"

1263
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,673
I'm like, "No," because I feel like
we're doing a great job,

1264
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:55,801
and we have more to show you guys.
It's just the beginning.

1265
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,612
Meat, meat!

1266
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,656
Careful of the hot plate.

1267
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,659
- That looks amazing!
- Can I have a bite?

1268
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,536
Thank you.

1269
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,914
- Do you know us?
- Yes.

1270
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,458
- Weren't you here before?
- Yes, that's right.

1271
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,271
- We were here when we were trainees.
- Yes, you guys ate here.

1272
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,590
- I remember.
- I've been here since the start.

1273
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,673
I didn't give you good service.

1274
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,635
Really?
Is that why you're so nice now?

1275
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,220
Yes. I hope you enjoy the food.

1276
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1277
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,681
Totally.

1278
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:46,351
Halsey contacted me all of a sudden.

1279
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,644
She was at Paris?

1280
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,331
She's like, "You in Paris?"
I'm like, "Don't tell me you're here."

1281
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,233
It was my first time meeting her.
I felt like it was my fifth time.

1282
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,694
And she said the same.
Like, "Was this our first time?"

1283
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,947
I'm like, "Yeah." She's just like us.
She just talks like us.

1284
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,825
- Is she from America, or…
- Yeah, I think she's from LA?

1285
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,410
LA! Come on, LA!

1286
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,122
- I want to live in Paris.
- Me too! For a year.

1287
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:10,542
- We will stay for a year.
- You're Parisian already.

1288
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,170
After a year, I'd like to go to the US.

1289
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:17,424
I want to live in Paris, but I also want
to live in the US and England.

1290
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,717
Twenty years?

1291
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:23,055
I feel like Lisa
would be traveling around the world.

1292
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,222
Forty three?

1293
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,242
- I'm gonna be 40?
- I'm gonna be 42.

1294
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,226
- Gonna be 40.
- We're gonna be 42.

1295
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,355
I feel we'll all be...
Do you think we'll all be married by then?

1296
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:35,150
- I think we might.
- Of course! It's 40… Like, come on!

1297
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:36,833
I don't know about babies, but…

1298
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,695
…I think we'd all be married.

1299
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,906
We'd have babies by then. Forty-two, 44…

1300
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,407
We'll have children?

1301
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,617
If not,

1302
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,703
we could also get married later in life.

1303
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,914
We'll be freshly married?

1304
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,707
No newborns!

1305
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:54,127
Aren't we going to make a comeback?

1306
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,587
At that age?

1307
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,881
BLACKPINK!

1308
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,716
We'll injure our backs!

1309
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,511
I don't think we'll be able to dance.

1310
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:05,097
We'll have to stand.
