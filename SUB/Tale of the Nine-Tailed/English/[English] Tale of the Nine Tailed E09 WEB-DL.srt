1
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,685
I knew it.

2
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,595
That jerk only cares
about his lady.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,264
Hey, kid!

4
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,334
Yeon?

5
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:34,504
I heard what you
just said about me.

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,415
I don't need your help.

7
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,614
Now is not the time
to be so arrogant.

8
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,085
You're not him.

9
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,214
Yeon wouldn't come to save me.

10
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,485
You're not wrong, I guess.

11
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,754
Show me proof that you're Yeon.

12
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:52,354
Proof? Like my social
security number?

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,195
Jwibulnori on the night
of the first full moon.

14
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:59,265
After having fun with flames,

15
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,265
you wet the bed.

16
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:04,305
- I called you this for three years.
- Shut it.

17
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,104
Bedwetter!

18
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,124
- I'm going to kill you.
- Them first.

19
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,475
Run!

20
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,604
Mom?

21
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:16,745
Dad?

22
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,014
Today, Ji Ah had...

23
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,044
a hypnotherapy session.

24
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,215
What did Dr. Kang say?

25
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,625
She's never seen a
case like hers before.

26
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,625
I know I shouldn't be,

27
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,465
but I can't help but be scared.

28
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,294
Would we be able to
protect our girl?

29
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,505
Will I be able to keep her safe?

30
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,685
Mom.

31
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,285
Mom?

32
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,324
Ji Ah, you're up.

33
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,565
I was going to wait
until we get home,

34
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,405
but here's your
birthday present.

35
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,315
My birthday?

36
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,695
This music box.

37
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:42,324
Could this be...

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,704
<font color="#00ff00">YEOU GOGAE</font>

39
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,514
"Yeou Gogae"?

40
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,255
We must not go.

41
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:07,885
Do you like your gift?

42
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,125
We'll end up in that accident.

43
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,655
- Stop the car!
- Once Ji A is better,

44
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:14,424
we'll go to the park and
ride the merry-go-round.

45
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,424
Dad, can't you hear me?

46
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,295
Stop the car!

47
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,094
Dad?

48
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,565
Mom!

49
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,755
They just won't die. When
did they get this strong?

50
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,394
- Maybe we've gotten weaker.
- As if.

51
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,204
Forget the lightning. Not
even the wind will shift.

52
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,904
Your powers aren't working?

53
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:10,714
Where could we actually be?

54
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:12,815
Isn't it obvious? The
Forest of the Starved.

55
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,224
Are we, really?

56
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,605
Dad, stop the car!

57
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:38,274
Dad, stop the car!

58
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,945
Stop the car, Dad!

59
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:04,574
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 9: SPIRIT OF DARKNESS</font>

60
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,115
I'm surprised.

61
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,885
I honestly thought
he'd come for the girl.

62
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,055
But he went to his brother.

63
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,885
So much for being at
each other's throats.

64
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,425
A mountain spirit
isn't an easy opponent.

65
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,594
Sorry?

66
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:31,065
Even at this very moment,
he's challenging me.

67
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,964
Are you saying he chose
his brother on purpose?

68
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,704
He probably figured it out...

69
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,774
that this isn't just
a test for these two,

70
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,774
but a test for him as well.

71
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,885
You've got to be kidding me.

72
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:58,154
How did the juice lady know...

73
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:59,295
that I can't get on planes?

74
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,795
- Is that for real?
- What happens if you do?

75
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,664
I suddenly go out of breath
and then sweat excessively.

76
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:07,235
Once I put on the seat
belt, I black out.

77
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,365
What did the juice
lady say to you?

78
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:13,375
She asked what I feared
the most in my life.

79
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,574
What you fear the most?

80
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,045
Could it be...

81
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,115
My gosh.

82
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,315
What is it?

83
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,885
There's a similar urban legend
that's been floating around online.

84
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,115
<font color="#00ff00">WHO KNOWS ABOUT
THE JUICE LADY?</font>

85
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,584
- "Who knows about the juice lady?"
- It's similar, right?

86
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:33,055
A lady hands you a juice box
and asks what you fear the most.

87
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,695
We think that this
is an urban legend...

88
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,524
similar to that of
the Hong Kong Granny.

89
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,594
There's one big difference
though. Once captivated by her,

90
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,964
you hear a song.

91
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:44,974
- A song.
- Did you hear it?

92
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,675
It's this one.

93
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:54,445
Isn't this the song that's sung
when dancing the ganggangsullae?

94
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:57,084
The lyrics give you
the chills though.

95
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:58,885
One tells you to
open the door...

96
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:00,914
while the other says
that there is no key.

97
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,284
Those two phrases repeat
throughout the song.

98
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:04,425
I'm loving this.

99
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,894
Is there anyone who
actually heard this song?

100
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,295
We couldn't find anyone which
is why we dropped the story.

101
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,435
How so?

102
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,394
Rumor has it that
no one wakes up...

103
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,704
after listening to the song.

104
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,834
- Forever?
- Yes, forever.

105
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:20,274
That's ridiculous!

106
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:22,904
What the...

107
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,545
Is this the "Unveiling
Urban Legends" team?

108
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:28,815
- Ji A, what's wrong?
- Ms. Nam?

109
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:30,214
- What's going on?
- Wake up!

110
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:32,814
Ji A! Ji A, wake up!

111
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,054
- My goodness.
- What happened?

112
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:52,005
Yeon, wake up.

113
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:53,505
Yeon.

114
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,314
Mr. Lee!

115
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:07,514
Mr. Lee!

116
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:11,085
Mr. Lee!

117
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:51,335
She would've crossed
Yeou Gogae by now.

118
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:54,235
Will I be able to
save them both...

119
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,904
from this Underworld?

120
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,044
Please. I hope I didn't
make the wrong choice.

121
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,585
Is this the best you can do...

122
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,495
to thank me for
saving your life?

123
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:25,294
What are you doing?

124
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:27,894
Can't you see?

125
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,404
Why are you here?

126
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,934
There's no way you
came here to save me.

127
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,875
I just had some free time.

128
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,414
I figured I'd use this chance to
see my one and only brother...

129
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,075
get sent to the Afterlife.

130
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:46,654
Don't joke with me. Why
did you choose me over her?

131
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,125
Good question.

132
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,184
I picked the wrong door.

133
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:52,255
You're lying.

134
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:56,194
I thought I was on
my way to save Ji A.

135
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,894
But when I got here, a bedwetter
was close to losing his life.

136
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,825
- How did this happen?
- I got bitten.

137
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,625
I guess I was pretty yummy.

138
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,024
The bleeding is one thing,
but you even have a bad fever.

139
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:35,534
I guess the poison
has started to spread.

140
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:45,174
It takes only an hour for the poison
to spread throughout the body.

141
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:47,375
I need to get him out
of here before that.

142
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:55,755
This is why I told you...

143
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,524
not to hang around with Imoogi.

144
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:01,595
Don't try to be a big
brother. It's really annoying.

145
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,294
You jerk.

146
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:07,995
Now run for your life.

147
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,674
What can I do to wake him up?

148
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,985
No one can wake him
up from the outside.

149
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,184
I tried everything I could,

150
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,284
but I wasn't able to
wake my husband up.

151
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,955
- Was it the same person?
- Yes.

152
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,524
In the past, she was a peddler
who sold items for women.

153
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,235
She'd approach people
with shiny things...

154
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,264
and ask them what
they feared the most.

155
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:45,904
That's how she bewitched them.

156
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,944
My husband was scared of tigers.

157
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:54,245
The things she makes people
see... Are they not illusions?

158
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,444
I also thought they
were hallucinations.

159
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:01,115
But Shin Ju,

160
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:03,585
I saw...

161
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,924
my husband get
bitten by a tiger.

162
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:08,664
His bones broke, and
his flesh got torn out.

163
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:12,465
My goodness.

164
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,764
Mr. Lee, please wake up.

165
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,875
Mr. Lee!

166
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,304
My goodness.

167
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,995
What...

168
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,325
What is she called?

169
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:43,564
The Spirit of Darkness.

170
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:46,465
"The Spirit of Darkness"?

171
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,205
She lives off the things
that are hidden...

172
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,875
deep inside our dark souls.

173
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:55,845
Ji A.

174
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:00,644
Ji A.

175
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,184
Ji A.

176
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,355
Mom?

177
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:15,965
Sweetheart, wake up and eat.

178
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,304
Mom, what are you doing here?

179
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:26,475
Why do you think?
It's Sunday today.

180
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,345
Did you work until
late yesterday?

181
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,544
Why does your company always
send you on business trips...

182
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:34,215
and make you work overtime?

183
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:37,784
"Company"?

184
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,784
Where do I work?

185
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,024
- Are you still sleepy?
- Answer me.

186
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,794
You're a director at a
broadcasting company.

187
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:52,135
You always get summoned by the
Press Arbitration Commission.

188
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,564
Why did I become a director?

189
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,005
- Because...
- To find you and Dad.

190
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:03,075
In 1999, at Yeou
Gogae, my life...

191
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,075
No, not just me.
Our entire family...

192
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,215
got destroyed.

193
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,284
What are you talking about?

194
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,455
You're not my mom.

195
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:16,585
You can't fool me twice.

196
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,605
Stop talking nonsense and
come eat your breakfast.

197
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:31,105
You really need to stop
joking around with me.

198
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:36,174
- What?
- Stop bringing up the accident.

199
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,115
Your dad and I were
completely heartbroken...

200
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,044
back when you were
in a coma for years.

201
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,284
I was...

202
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:46,715
in a coma?

203
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,855
Do you remember what
you used to give me...

204
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,855
every time I went to the
doctor to get a shot?

205
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,184
Strawberry candy.

206
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,524
Now stop it and come outside.

207
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,434
Wait.

208
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,345
What is it this time?

209
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:44,475
I want...

210
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:47,274
walnut cookies.

211
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:50,385
Walnut cookies?

212
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:58,894
Mom, I want...

213
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:00,825
walnut cookies.

214
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,064
We never buy walnut cookies.

215
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,934
I had to go to the hospital
because it turned out...

216
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,265
I was allergic to nuts.

217
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,204
Oh, right. I forgot.

218
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:12,934
You're not my mom.

219
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,734
Where's my mom?

220
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,174
I am your mom.

221
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:41,194
Stop talking nonsense.

222
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:44,964
My goodness, you're
allergic to nuts.

223
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,194
She got to meet
her family again?

224
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,625
How nice.

225
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:14,964
I thought her fear would be those
fake parents, but I guess not.

226
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,765
I guess that's not...

227
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:19,904
what she's really scared of.

228
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,845
It looks like her family
is what drags her down...

229
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,174
just like how it was
in her past life.

230
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,484
Is it getting colder?

231
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:35,724
Her subconscious
created this place.

232
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,254
She probably won't welcome us...

233
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:39,555
since we're outsiders.

234
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:41,454
Let's go.

235
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,545
Nice! Cheesecake!

236
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,714
Did you see?

237
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,115
My plan failed.

238
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,254
Yeon didn't show.

239
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:08,315
Then why are you back?

240
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:12,154
She can try to use her brain,
but she won't get out alive.

241
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,394
When you really look at it,

242
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,164
the mind is much more
fragile than they think.

243
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,234
It's the world that the lifelong
wounds of the heart created.

244
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:24,835
If she dies in there,
will she die for real?

245
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,605
Do you want to try too?

246
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,315
Let go of me!

247
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,115
- Spirit of Darkness.
- Yes?

248
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,345
Don't touch my things.

249
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,254
I was just playing.

250
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,025
Forgive me.

251
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:49,325
There was a lot more
after "Forgive me."

252
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:55,335
"He may be Imoogi but was
asleep for over 600 years."

253
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:57,105
"He can't be as strong
as he used to be."

254
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,375
"Why don't you..."

255
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:04,244
"try me?"

256
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:08,075
I want to see as well.

257
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:16,355
How dare I think such a thing?

258
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,825
Please forgive me.

259
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,924
Please forgive me.

260
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,065
Will you please give me a hug?

261
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:40,075
Mom.

262
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,285
My mom.

263
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,315
It's okay if it's a dream.

264
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,785
Please don't go.

265
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:54,855
Don't leave me all alone.

266
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:57,325
Did you have a
scary dream again?

267
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:01,664
Yes.

268
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,875
I wish it were all a dream.

269
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:12,775
What was the dream about?

270
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,984
About losing...

271
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:18,414
you and Dad.

272
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,325
Why are you crying?
It was just a dream.

273
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:30,394
I'm sorry...

274
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,335
for surviving alone.

275
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,504
I tried to be strong
all this time,

276
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:49,984
but to be honest, I was
terribly scared and lonely.

277
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:55,454
I hated going home,
so I used to sit...

278
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:58,994
at a bus stop for hours.

279
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:02,795
I'm sorry, Mom.

280
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:07,295
To be honest,

281
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:12,335
I hated you and Dad a little..

282
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,474
You left me all alone,

283
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,974
and you wouldn't come back
no matter how long I waited.

284
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,385
You didn't forget me, right?

285
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:31,484
How could I forget...

286
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,394
a daughter this pretty?

287
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:41,565
I've missed you, Mom.

288
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:07,194
We've been going in circles.

289
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,565
We don't have time for this.

290
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,295
I wonder if Ji A is okay.

291
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:15,605
Please. Please hang
on a little longer.

292
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,275
Let go.

293
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,174
You're in no
condition to be proud.

294
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,474
I'm a corpse without my pride.

295
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,785
You look like a corpse already.

296
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,424
You've heard of
phantom pain, right?

297
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,865
You mean how a soldier who
lost his leg in a war...

298
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:46,095
complains of pain in his
leg all night long, right?

299
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,635
The moment you sense pain in
a leg that is not there...

300
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,464
is when true pain begins.

301
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:54,904
Once pain begins, the door
will have disappeared.

302
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,504
That is the world
she shows them.

303
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:04,184
Doorkeeper, doorkeeper,
open the door

304
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:08,015
I can't I don't have the key

305
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,924
- What is it?
- I can't go any further.

306
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:18,325
The poison spread
everywhere. I can barely see.

307
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,934
I'm sick of walking
with this leg.

308
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,404
So?

309
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,204
You'll sit here and become
food for evil spirits?

310
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:30,004
Go to your woman. It's
too late for me anyway.

311
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:39,414
You haven't changed.

312
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,355
You're just like
when we first met.

313
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:48,795
You still give up easily
and you still whine.

314
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:51,125
Why are life and death
so simple for you?

315
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,494
Because nothing
is precious to me.

316
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:56,664
I don't have a first love to
protect with my life as you do,

317
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:00,434
and I don't have a family that
I'm waiting desperately for...

318
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,244
as she does.

319
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:15,484
I shouldn't have come.

320
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:18,625
Neither then nor now.

321
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:22,595
I came to see you because I
heard you had my father's blood,

322
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:23,795
but you're pathetic.

323
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:25,934
You have no will to live either.

324
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:27,865
I wasted my time.

325
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:30,765
I'm leaving.

326
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:34,734
Once I die,

327
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,615
bury me in the woods of
Baekdudaegan where we used to live.

328
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:42,075
Am I your will?

329
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,724
I wish we could go
back to those days.

330
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:02,035
There were azaleas everywhere.

331
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:07,704
It's strange.

332
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:11,974
I can't remember how
the azaleas tasted...

333
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,144
back then.

334
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,355
If you don't remember
how the azalea tasted,

335
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:28,025
get out alive and
eat some, you idiot!

336
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,765
At least try to
survive, will you?

337
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,765
Be honest. Why
did you come here?

338
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:42,234
To save both Ji A and you.

339
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,845
- You expect me to believe that?
- I don't care!

340
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,775
I almost died by your knife.

341
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:52,714
You massacred an entire town.

342
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,454
- You deserved it.
- Exactly.

343
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:58,125
Why are you saving
someone you tried to kill?

344
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:08,234
Listen carefully.

345
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:13,974
My sword has never
missed, not even once.

346
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,275
I have never...

347
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:18,545
missed the target.

348
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:28,914
Think hard with that stupid brain
of yours why you survived my sword.

349
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,254
I'm leaving. And I'm
never coming back.

350
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:28,943
Boat number four just set
sail down Samdo River.

351
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:31,114
Tell the captain to
turn the boat around.

352
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:35,884
An elder in the ICU
passed away just now...

353
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:37,253
still hooked to the machine.

354
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:44,054
So where were we?

355
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,894
- The Spirit of Darkness.
- The Spirit of Darkness?

356
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,763
Is such a thing still
present in this realm?

357
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,463
After talking to her,
Mr. Lee and Lady A Eum...

358
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:55,933
I mean, Ms. Nam. Anyway,
they're out cold.

359
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:00,443
Please tell me how
I can help them.

360
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:03,574
You're in over your head.

361
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:07,483
The girl is with her family...

362
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,253
and Yeon is at the
Forest of the Starved.

363
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:14,423
The Forest of the Starved?

364
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:16,423
Probably to save
his younger brother.

365
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,624
- Then his brother too?
- Let me ask though.

366
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,223
Since when were those two tight?

367
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:24,963
How's that the issue right now?

368
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,364
- It is to me.
- Honey!

369
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,904
He takes on too much
of the burden himself.

370
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:32,134
He's the kind that
digs his own grave.

371
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:36,614
That's what made him
a mountain spirit.

372
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,544
The spirit of the mountains...

373
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:40,983
had his heart touched by
each and every organism.

374
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:42,513
So how could he not
care for his brother?

375
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,584
Brother, my foot.

376
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,923
Rang committed too many crimes.

377
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,423
Honey, how can you be so...

378
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:52,354
Please help them, ma'am.

379
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,663
I will give up my life
instead, so please.

380
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:01,134
You're making a
fool of yourself.

381
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:04,334
Why give up your life for
something Yeon chose to do?

382
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,104
Please let me know
how I can save them,

383
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,513
and I'll do everything
you order me to do.

384
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:18,983
Everything I order?

385
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,463
Don't you care about your life?

386
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,173
How could you trade it in
for that piece of cloth?

387
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,114
I'm sure this is
what Mr. Lee wants.

388
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:48,513
You and Yeon both. It
must be a fox thing.

389
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,354
I don't quite get it though.

390
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,483
Why did he choose Rang
instead of Ms. Nam?

391
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,294
They're both in a world created
by their unresolved issues.

392
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:00,394
For them both, that's family.

393
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:04,794
If she is reunited with the
family she's been searching for,

394
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,973
there wouldn't be
room for anyone else.

395
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:15,243
There will be no way for
him to enter the house.

396
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:17,773
Do you mean...

397
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,284
Yeon probably already knew...

398
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,523
what he's up against.

399
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,763
Does an exit even exist?

400
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,733
There was an entrance, so
there must be an exit too.

401
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,834
I came through the wardrobe.

402
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:42,973
The wardrobe door
led to our old house.

403
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:48,044
Not the Forest of the Starved?

404
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,013
No.

405
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:52,544
Tell me everything you saw.

406
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:56,814
The village people came
with weapons in their hands.

407
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:00,784
My mom watched as they
beat me to a pulp.

408
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:04,124
- Then...
- The Forest of the Starved.

409
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:05,993
Yes.

410
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:10,034
No wonder. I knew it.

411
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,963
That's why we
couldn't spot a door.

412
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,703
What do you mean?

413
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,973
Haven't you figured
out who that lady is?

414
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,134
Is it someone you know?

415
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,344
She's been gouging you
with your worst memories.

416
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,404
Are you saying...

417
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,443
What's her name again?

418
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:27,614
The Spirit of Darkness.

419
00:32:29,044 --> 00:32:30,154
The Spirit of Darkness.

420
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,544
<font color="#00ff00">MISSING AFTER CAR
ACCIDENT AT YEOU GOGAE</font>

421
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:07,784
This room...

422
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,753
may seem like
mine, but it isn't.

423
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,833
Where on earth...

424
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,233
am I?

425
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,034
What's that noise?

426
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:58,304
Sae Rom.

427
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:02,244
What did the doctor say?

428
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,014
They ran every test on her,

429
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:05,974
but they can't figure
out what's wrong.

430
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:10,213
Unbelievable. What
on earth is going on?

431
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:14,253
Ji A, open your
eyes. Please wake up.

432
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,603
Up until a minute ago,

433
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:30,103
I was at the office.

434
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,895
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE</font>

435
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,384
The juice lady.

436
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:48,954
Miss, what do you fear the most?

437
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:51,054
It must be Yeou Gogae.

438
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,264
That's right. After
my encounter with her,

439
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:57,134
I was taken to Yeou Gogae.

440
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:05,793
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

441
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,643
Then what is this place?

442
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:18,114
Kiddo, are you
trying to starve us?

443
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:21,623
- Dad?
- I'm hungry.

444
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,693
- Dad!
- Goodness.

445
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:30,664
My little princess.

446
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,063
- Let's go and eat.
- Sure.

447
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:33,233
Come on.

448
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,499
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

449
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:56,623
The path ends here.

450
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,724
Just keep going.

451
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:00,923
Not on this leg.

452
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:03,023
A path and a door will appear
when you overcome your fear.

453
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,264
- I don't see any door.
- Don't be a wuss!

454
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,934
Stay strong and think of
what you fear the most.

455
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,873
What...

456
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:19,344
What I fear the most?

457
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:22,813
Being abandoned.

458
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:26,824
Mom abandoned me...

459
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,293
and so did you.

460
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,123
You've got to be kidding me.

461
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:36,833
I...

462
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:40,934
never abandoned you.

463
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:04,724
I see it.

464
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:10,994
Let's go.

465
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:32,114
Make sure you stay alive.

466
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,434
Keep climbing!

467
00:38:02,284 --> 00:38:03,384
Don't look!

468
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,353
She's not your mom! Don't look!

469
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:13,664
Mom?

470
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,793
Darn it.

471
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:22,034
Darn it!

472
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,483
No!

473
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:08,483
Mr. Lee!

474
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:12,014
I need to go.

475
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:14,224
Go where?

476
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,023
Where do you need to go?

477
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:17,353
To Yeon.

478
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,664
To Yeon.

479
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:22,893
I must go to Yeon.

480
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,393
Where are you trying to go?

481
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:26,804
To Yeon...

482
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,804
I need to go to Yeon.

483
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,304
Gimbap.

484
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,943
Dad, it's your handmade gimbap.

485
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:37,213
Yes, he made gimbap again.

486
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,684
The end parts always
taste the best.

487
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:42,844
- Let's eat the ends first.
- Let's sprinkle some sesame seeds.

488
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:44,353
Let's eat.

489
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:46,654
Let's try it. It's
going to be delicious.

490
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:51,023
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

491
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:52,523
It's delicious.

492
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,063
Ji A.

493
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:57,764
Thank you for the meal.

494
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,704
- The soup is delicious too.
- Really?

495
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:20,983
Spinach, carrots, cucumber,
ham, and pickled radish.

496
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:22,784
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

497
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:24,654
It's not that.

498
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:29,164
The ingredients are very
simple, but for some reason,

499
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:32,193
no other gimbap ever
tastes this good.

500
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,304
Is that a compliment?
It's a compliment, right?

501
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,634
My daughter just complimented
me. I'm so happy.

502
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:41,074
It feels great.

503
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:44,844
- Eat up.
- Okay.

504
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:47,543
It's even more delicious today.

505
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:48,583
Really? Thank you.

506
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:53,184
Suddenly, I started to think...

507
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:58,023
that the life I've lived until now
might've been a long nightmare...

508
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,224
and that this one
might actually be real.

509
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:07,434
If this is a dream,

510
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:10,273
I really hope I never wake up.

511
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:19,474
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

512
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,083
What's going on?

513
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,393
- Is something happening to her?
- Hey.

514
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:32,853
- Ji A! Ji A, wake up!
- Wait.

515
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:34,824
Doctor! Doctor!

516
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:36,623
Where's the doctor?

517
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:38,034
Go get the doctor.

518
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:40,563
Doctor, over here.

519
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:43,204
It's delicious.

520
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,034
I spilled some here.

521
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,673
Your dad is unbelievable. Here.

522
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:49,844
Thank you.

523
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:51,474
It's delicious.

524
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,753
Who was that just now?

525
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,423
Who was he again?

526
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:04,094
Does it taste better than the ones
I made for you when we got married?

527
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,724
I can't remember.

528
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,693
Why can't you remember? I
made you gimbap so often.

529
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,434
It was too long ago.

530
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:19,904
You must not be late.

531
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:23,474
If you're late, they'll never
be able to leave that world.

532
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,914
We didn't do anything. We
were just by her side...

533
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,414
Where did she go?

534
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:32,384
- What?
- What?

535
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:51,974
This is all I can do.

536
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,844
I hope you both return.

537
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,824
This was when you made us...

538
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:10,353
carnations for the first time back
when you were in kindergarten.

539
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:12,224
You know the safety
pin that comes with it?

540
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,423
You accidentally poked
my chest with that.

541
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,463
And I ended up bleeding so much.

542
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:17,864
- I did that?
- Yes.

543
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,293
You were an amazing daughter.

544
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,434
Don't we still have the
carnation somewhere?

545
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,833
I made sure I kept
it nice and safe.

546
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:28,043
Ta-da.

547
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,974
"Mom. Dad. I love you."

548
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:32,373
You still have this?

549
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:33,614
Of course. It's our
family treasure.

550
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,344
My goodness. Let me see.

551
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,483
You really preserved it well.

552
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:41,284
Of course. It's precious to me.

553
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:45,923
- Let's see.
- You smudged your fingerprints.

554
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,423
- The phone is ringing.
- You're right.

555
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:49,693
- She's adorable.
- Look at the other hand.

556
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:52,034
I know. Gosh, it's
all coming back.

557
00:43:52,034 --> 00:43:54,034
- Don't you hear the phone ringing?
- She's so adorable.

558
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,434
Look at all the baby hair.

559
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,233
Exactly.

560
00:43:57,603 --> 00:43:59,773
- She has baby hair here as well.
- You're right.

561
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,404
- She's so cute.
- This was so long ago.

562
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,654
Hello?

563
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,023
It's me.

564
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,523
Who?

565
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,864
Lee Yeon.

566
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:55,923
"Lee Yeon"?

567
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:00,434
I'm sorry I couldn't go
there to bring you back.

568
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:03,634
Who are you?

569
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,273
I think I know you,
but I don't remember.

570
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:10,744
You must remember.

571
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:15,114
You need to realize where
you are and why you're there.

572
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,753
You need to realize that on your own
in order to come back to reality.

573
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:22,483
What do you mean?

574
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:24,193
Come back, Ji A.

575
00:45:24,994 --> 00:45:28,423
I'll always be waiting for you.

576
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:30,193
Don't hang up.

577
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:00,523
You must come back.

578
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:13,773
I wonder who that was.

579
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,503
I don't know who he was,

580
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:18,143
but I feel like I left behind
something really important.

581
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,463
It's a bundle of mugwort.

582
00:46:40,094 --> 00:46:43,134
It's special enough.
At least to me today.

583
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:48,103
I'm sorry I couldn't go
there to bring you back.

584
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:50,873
What if I've been bewitched?

585
00:46:58,654 --> 00:46:59,813
You're here.

586
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:02,023
You must remember.

587
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,054
You need to realize where
you are and why you're there.

588
00:47:07,463 --> 00:47:08,893
Come back, Ji A.

589
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:10,634
Did you sleep well?

590
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:14,833
I'll always be waiting for you.

591
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,664
You'll be able to
find your parents.

592
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:18,503
I'll make sure of it.

593
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:20,904
Thanks, Yeon.

594
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:24,673
Yeon.

595
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,353
It's the poison of
the evil spirit.

596
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:39,494
Do something.

597
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,264
Mr. Lee Yeon isn't back yet.

598
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:48,204
No! You can't go.

599
00:47:48,804 --> 00:47:50,364
I'll die if he dies.

600
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:53,074
I'll repay you for this somehow.

601
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:58,614
I'm begging you.

602
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:00,844
I'm begging you.

603
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,253
Help him. I'm begging you.

604
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:33,943
- Look at this hat.
- It's so cute.

605
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,284
Isn't this hat pretty?

606
00:48:35,284 --> 00:48:36,543
- Did you knit it?
- Yes.

607
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:39,784
How is she so tiny?

608
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,184
Oh, my gosh.

609
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,983
- She's tiny even now.
- I know.

610
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:47,693
Ji A. Look at this.

611
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:50,994
It was the day you
started babbling.

612
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,293
You threw up on your mom's chest
right after we took this picture.

613
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,603
It was because we tried
new formula that day.

614
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,733
How do you remember all of that?

615
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,543
Gosh. Because we love you.

616
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:04,614
Because we love our
daughter's every gesture,

617
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:06,114
kick, babble,

618
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:08,043
and cries so loud that
it woke up the neighbors.

619
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,784
I see.

620
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,684
I was very loved.

621
00:49:15,324 --> 00:49:17,293
So cute. Look at that face.

622
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:19,753
So cute.

623
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:21,864
Look at this.

624
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:24,494
You know...

625
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:29,764
How would you feel
if you lost me?

626
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:32,434
Why would we lose you?

627
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:36,804
I'm just asking.
Things happen in life.

628
00:49:36,804 --> 00:49:38,643
My gosh. Don't you worry.

629
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,043
We'll search the corners
of the earth and find you.

630
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,684
- Of course. You're my baby.
- Of course.

631
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:48,983
I'll do the same.

632
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:53,023
I promise I will find you both.

633
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:55,123
What do you mean?

634
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,293
Someone asked me...

635
00:49:59,193 --> 00:50:01,733
what I feared the
most in the world.

636
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,074
What I fear the most...

637
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:09,003
is being parted from you.

638
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,744
What's wrong?

639
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,184
Sorry, Mom.

640
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:17,983
I'm sorry, Dad.

641
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:22,724
I have to go.

642
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,923
Where are you going?

643
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:27,123
- Honey, stop her!
- Ji A!

644
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,764
If you walk out there,

645
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,963
you may never see us ever again!

646
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,164
Ji A.

647
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,134
Why are you trying
to abandon us?

648
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:42,744
I'm not.

649
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,014
Ji A.

650
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:53,154
Stay here and live with us.

651
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,853
This isn't reality.

652
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:57,623
Who cares?

653
00:50:58,594 --> 00:51:00,523
Our family is happy here.

654
00:51:00,864 --> 00:51:02,324
That's all that matters.

655
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:04,164
Why are you trying to be alone?

656
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,733
Mom and Dad are here.

657
00:51:10,063 --> 00:51:11,204
I'm not alone.

658
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,143
Yeon is with me.

659
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,844
Ji A.

660
00:51:16,603 --> 00:51:19,813
- Please.
- Ji A. Please.

661
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:23,443
I have faith in Yeon.

662
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:28,554
Ji A!

663
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,773
That wench woke up too.

664
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:52,713
Isn't this cheating?

665
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:54,614
It looked like fair play to me.

666
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:56,614
What should we do now?

667
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,253
- This is good enough.
- What?

668
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,324
I simply wanted to look
into the abyss of her heart.

669
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:06,193
And I got Yeon thanks to that.

670
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,094
Yeon.

671
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:15,864
You woke me up.

672
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,773
You said you'd
always wait for me.

673
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,713
Where are you?

674
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:35,853
Just where did you go?

675
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:23,804
So this is my
personal Underworld.

676
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,474
Consumed by loneliness...

677
00:53:28,244 --> 00:53:30,103
and dying in a world...

678
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,574
without her.

679
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:11,483
How's Mr. Lee?

680
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,083
It'll take a few days for
the poison to leave his body,

681
00:54:14,623 --> 00:54:16,054
but he'll be fine in no time.

682
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:19,123
Why aren't you
asking me anything?

683
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:22,764
You can see...

684
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:24,463
why I approached you.

685
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,074
You knew already.

686
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,673
I happened to see
you two together.

687
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:39,514
I was taken to a junkyard
and beaten up thanks to that.

688
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,414
- By Mr. Lee?
- Yes.

689
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:46,213
Then why did you treat him?

690
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:52,423
Because I didn't
want you to cry.

691
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:09,773
Shin Ju.

692
00:55:10,744 --> 00:55:11,844
Mr. Lee.

693
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:18,983
How's Yeon?

694
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:21,554
Is he back?

695
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:07,864
Mr. Lee. Please...

696
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,034
wake up.

697
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:26,583
What do we do? Mr. Lee...

698
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:52,643
I wonder...

699
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:55,914
whether Ji A
returned home safely.

700
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:34,262
I wanted to tell her...

701
00:57:34,972 --> 00:57:38,173
how pretty she looked
when eating dakbal.

702
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:43,043
I wanted to wish her...

703
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:47,412
the most typical
good night's sleep.

704
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:52,153
I wanted to spend...

705
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,253
more time with you
in this lifetime.

706
00:57:58,523 --> 00:58:01,762
I wanted to protect
all your nights...

707
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:05,133
and all your days.

708
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,702
It seems like I'm
stuck here though.

709
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:16,972
I miss you,

710
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:19,543
Yeon.

711
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:35,823
Even a nine-tailed fox who
was also a mountain spirit...

712
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:38,222
can't do better.

713
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:43,133
Hey, don't die.

714
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,503
It won't be any fun if you do.

715
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:57,043
At least he's not dead yet.

716
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:03,082
This sweet body of yours
will serve Imoogi...

717
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:07,323
and bring disorder
to this world.

718
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:24,532
Spirit of Darkness.

719
01:00:24,532 --> 01:00:25,843
What on earth?

720
01:00:27,142 --> 01:00:28,242
You're awake.

721
01:00:28,843 --> 01:00:31,043
Did Ji A get back home safely?

722
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:34,213
Why does that matter when
you're at the brink of death?

723
01:00:35,582 --> 01:00:36,952
Please...

724
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:40,682
Please tell me.

725
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:47,062
But I don't want to.

726
01:00:57,903 --> 01:00:59,872
I'm desperate.

727
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,573
Please tell me.

728
01:01:02,573 --> 01:01:04,912
Stop making a fool of yourself.

729
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,852
Fine. She made it out.

730
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:15,653
But she would've been
better off staying though.

731
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:18,293
First her parents and now you.

732
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:21,392
She's barely
hanging on as it is.

733
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:25,832
So she's back home.

734
01:01:26,702 --> 01:01:27,972
You're smiling?

735
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:33,142
Of course. Did you
expect me to cry?

736
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:44,282
It wasn't easy luring
you to this place.

737
01:01:44,722 --> 01:01:45,782
What?

738
01:01:58,262 --> 01:01:59,633
Do you really believe...

739
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:02,832
that one lousy spirit could
pull me off that cliff?

740
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,242
You deliberately...

741
01:02:05,242 --> 01:02:06,303
Spirit of Darkness,

742
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:09,343
it's my turn to say
your signature phrase.

743
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:12,012
"What do you fear the most?"

744
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:17,952
I am darkness itself and the
embodiment of your fears.

745
01:02:18,383 --> 01:02:19,923
Why would I fear anything?

746
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:21,323
You're dying, aren't you?

747
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:24,693
People have forgotten
all about you now.

748
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,923
No one speaks stories
of you anymore.

749
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:31,093
You seek attention by
giving out juice boxes...

750
01:02:31,602 --> 01:02:33,133
and take your anger out
on Ms. Snail Bride...

751
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:34,633
since she's more well-known.

752
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:37,702
How... How dare you.

753
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:40,303
My brother couldn't
even recall your name.

754
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,372
Shut it!

755
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,012
You...

756
01:02:44,613 --> 01:02:47,012
will be trapped in the
endless torment you created...

757
01:02:48,082 --> 01:02:50,553
and live wishing you were dead.

758
01:03:06,702 --> 01:03:08,032
Not so fast.

759
01:03:14,812 --> 01:03:17,073
I see you forgot
one crucial detail.

760
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:20,242
This isn't the Forest
of the Starved.

761
01:03:21,113 --> 01:03:22,852
It's the subconscious
of a mountain spirit.

762
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:25,452
In other words, you're
on my home ground.

763
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,293
I can't see anything.

764
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:42,773
What is it that you want?

765
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:46,372
Not you, that's for sure.

766
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:56,153
I found you.

767
01:04:02,222 --> 01:04:05,423
I'll soon be coming for you,

768
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:07,222
so sit tight.

769
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:36,323
The nine-tailed fox who fell
in love with a human girl.

770
01:04:37,452 --> 01:04:39,293
Once again,

771
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:42,532
you'll be the one
to end her life.

772
01:04:43,733 --> 01:04:46,762
That is your destiny.

773
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:50,273
I'd worry more about
your fate if I were you.

774
01:06:22,963 --> 01:06:24,032
Don't come to me.

775
01:06:26,263 --> 01:06:27,633
Stay where you are.

776
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:30,032
From now on,

777
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:32,572
I'll go to you.

778
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:00,032
I...

779
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:03,103
waited for you.

780
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:16,241
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

781
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:18,413
<i>Repay my kindness, Yeon.</i>

782
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:19,812
<i>No.</i>

783
01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:22,253
<i>I was supposed to have it all.</i>

784
01:08:22,253 --> 01:08:23,552
<i>I was meant to be the
mountain spirit...</i>

785
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:24,882
<i>and have that woman by my side.</i>

786
01:08:24,982 --> 01:08:26,052
<i>You woke up late.</i>

787
01:08:26,653 --> 01:08:27,953
<i>I want to break the contract.</i>

788
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:29,852
<i>It's not entirely impossible.</i>

789
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:32,262
<i>You must kill your brother
with your own two hands.</i>

790
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:33,762
<i>I will.</i>

791
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:38,092
<i>Sacrifice the mountain spirit. Then
you can have your parents back.</i>

792
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:40,132
<i>Yeon, if you give up your body,</i>

793
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:43,073
<i>I will let everyone else live.</i>
