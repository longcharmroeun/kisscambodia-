7
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:03,785
I knew it.

8
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,695
That jerk only cares
about his lady.

9
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,364
Hey, kid!

10
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:18,434
Yeon?

11
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,604
I heard what you
just said about me.

12
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:26,515
I don't need your help.

13
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,714
Now is not the time
to be so arrogant.

14
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,185
You're not him.

15
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,314
Yeon wouldn't come to save me.

16
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:36,585
You're not wrong, I guess.

17
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:38,854
Show me proof that you're Yeon.

18
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,454
Proof? Like my social
security number?

19
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,295
Jwibulnori on the night
of the first full moon.

20
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:48,365
After having fun with flames,

21
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,365
you wet the bed.

22
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,405
- I called you this for three years.
- Shut it.

23
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,204
Bedwetter!

24
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,224
- I'm going to kill you.
- Them first.

25
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:29,575
Run!

26
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:58,704
Mom?

27
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:05,845
Dad?

28
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,114
Today, Ji Ah had...

29
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,144
a hypnotherapy session.

30
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,315
What did Dr. Kang say?

31
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,725
She's never seen a
case like hers before.

32
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:21,725
I know I shouldn't be,

33
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,565
but I can't help but be scared.

34
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,394
Would we be able to
protect our girl?

35
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,605
Will I be able to keep her safe?

36
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:46,785
Mom.

37
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,385
Mom?

38
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,424
Ji Ah, you're up.

39
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,665
I was going to wait
until we get home,

40
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,505
but here's your
birthday present.

41
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,415
My birthday?

42
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:28,795
This music box.

43
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,424
Could this be...

44
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:45,804
<font color="#00ff00">YEOU GOGAE</font>

45
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,614
"Yeou Gogae"?

46
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,355
We must not go.

47
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:56,985
Do you like your gift?

48
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,225
We'll end up in that accident.

49
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,755
- Stop the car!
- Once Ji A is better,

50
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,524
we'll go to the park and
ride the merry-go-round.

51
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,524
Dad, can't you hear me?

52
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:07,395
Stop the car!

53
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,194
Dad?

54
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,665
Mom!

55
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,855
They just won't die. When
did they get this strong?

56
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:34,494
- Maybe we've gotten weaker.
- As if.

57
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,304
Forget the lightning. Not
even the wind will shift.

58
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,004
Your powers aren't working?

59
00:05:58,645 --> 00:05:59,814
Where could we actually be?

60
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,915
Isn't it obvious? The
Forest of the Starved.

61
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:05,324
Are we, really?

62
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,705
Dad, stop the car!

63
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,374
Dad, stop the car!

64
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,045
Stop the car, Dad!

65
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:53,674
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 9: SPIRIT OF DARKNESS</font>

66
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,215
I'm surprised.

67
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:07,985
I honestly thought
he'd come for the girl.

68
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,155
But he went to his brother.

69
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,985
So much for being at
each other's throats.

70
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:15,525
A mountain spirit
isn't an easy opponent.

71
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:16,694
Sorry?

72
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,165
Even at this very moment,
he's challenging me.

73
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:24,064
Are you saying he chose
his brother on purpose?

74
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:27,804
He probably figured it out...

75
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,874
that this isn't just
a test for these two,

76
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:33,874
but a test for him as well.

77
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:42,985
You've got to be kidding me.

78
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:47,254
How did the juice lady know...

79
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:48,395
that I can't get on planes?

80
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,895
- Is that for real?
- What happens if you do?

81
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,764
I suddenly go out of breath
and then sweat excessively.

82
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,335
Once I put on the seat
belt, I black out.

83
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,465
What did the juice
lady say to you?

84
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,475
She asked what I feared
the most in my life.

85
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,674
What you fear the most?

86
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,145
Could it be...

87
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,215
My gosh.

88
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,415
What is it?

89
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,985
There's a similar urban legend
that's been floating around online.

90
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,215
<font color="#00ff00">WHO KNOWS ABOUT
THE JUICE LADY?</font>

91
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:18,684
- "Who knows about the juice lady?"
- It's similar, right?

92
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:22,155
A lady hands you a juice box
and asks what you fear the most.

93
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,795
We think that this
is an urban legend...

94
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,624
similar to that of
the Hong Kong Granny.

95
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,694
There's one big difference
though. Once captivated by her,

96
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:32,064
you hear a song.

97
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:34,074
- A song.
- Did you hear it?

98
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,775
It's this one.

99
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:43,545
Isn't this the song that's sung
when dancing the ganggangsullae?

100
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,184
The lyrics give you
the chills though.

101
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:47,985
One tells you to
open the door...

102
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,014
while the other says
that there is no key.

103
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,384
Those two phrases repeat
throughout the song.

104
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,525
I'm loving this.

105
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,994
Is there anyone who
actually heard this song?

106
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,395
We couldn't find anyone which
is why we dropped the story.

107
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:00,535
How so?

108
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:03,494
Rumor has it that
no one wakes up...

109
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,804
after listening to the song.

110
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:06,934
- Forever?
- Yes, forever.

111
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,374
That's ridiculous!

112
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,004
What the...

113
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:13,645
Is this the "Unveiling
Urban Legends" team?

114
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:17,915
- Ji A, what's wrong?
- Ms. Nam?

115
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,314
- What's going on?
- Wake up!

116
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:21,914
Ji A! Ji A, wake up!

117
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,154
- My goodness.
- What happened?

118
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:41,105
Yeon, wake up.

119
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:42,605
Yeon.

120
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:52,414
Mr. Lee!

121
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,614
Mr. Lee!

122
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,185
Mr. Lee!

123
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:40,435
She would've crossed
Yeou Gogae by now.

124
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,335
Will I be able to
save them both...

125
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,004
from this Underworld?

126
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:51,144
Please. I hope I didn't
make the wrong choice.

127
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,685
Is this the best you can do...

128
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,595
to thank me for
saving your life?

129
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,394
What are you doing?

130
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:16,994
Can't you see?

131
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:19,504
Why are you here?

132
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,034
There's no way you
came here to save me.

133
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,975
I just had some free time.

134
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,514
I figured I'd use this chance to
see my one and only brother...

135
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,175
get sent to the Afterlife.

136
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:35,754
Don't joke with me. Why
did you choose me over her?

137
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:37,225
Good question.

138
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,284
I picked the wrong door.

139
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,355
You're lying.

140
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:45,294
I thought I was on
my way to save Ji A.

141
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:48,994
But when I got here, a bedwetter
was close to losing his life.

142
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,925
- How did this happen?
- I got bitten.

143
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,725
I guess I was pretty yummy.

144
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,124
The bleeding is one thing,
but you even have a bad fever.

145
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,634
I guess the poison
has started to spread.

146
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,274
It takes only an hour for the poison
to spread throughout the body.

147
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,475
I need to get him out
of here before that.

148
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:44,855
This is why I told you...

149
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,624
not to hang around with Imoogi.

150
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,695
Don't try to be a big
brother. It's really annoying.

151
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,394
You jerk.

152
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,095
Now run for your life.

153
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,774
What can I do to wake him up?

154
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:11,085
No one can wake him
up from the outside.

155
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,284
I tried everything I could,

156
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,384
but I wasn't able to
wake my husband up.

157
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,055
- Was it the same person?
- Yes.

158
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:25,624
In the past, she was a peddler
who sold items for women.

159
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,335
She'd approach people
with shiny things...

160
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,364
and ask them what
they feared the most.

161
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,004
That's how she bewitched them.

162
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:40,044
My husband was scared of tigers.

163
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:43,345
The things she makes people
see... Are they not illusions?

164
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,544
I also thought they
were hallucinations.

165
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:50,215
But Shin Ju,

166
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,685
I saw...

167
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,024
my husband get
bitten by a tiger.

168
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,764
His bones broke, and
his flesh got torn out.

169
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,565
My goodness.

170
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,864
Mr. Lee, please wake up.

171
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,975
Mr. Lee!

172
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:11,404
My goodness.

173
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,095
What...

174
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,425
What is she called?

175
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:32,664
The Spirit of Darkness.

176
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,565
"The Spirit of Darkness"?

177
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,305
She lives off the things
that are hidden...

178
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,975
deep inside our dark souls.

179
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:44,945
Ji A.

180
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:49,744
Ji A.

181
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:53,284
Ji A.

182
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:02,455
Mom?

183
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:05,065
Sweetheart, wake up and eat.

184
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:13,404
Mom, what are you doing here?

185
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,575
Why do you think?
It's Sunday today.

186
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:18,445
Did you work until
late yesterday?

187
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,644
Why does your company always
send you on business trips...

188
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,315
and make you work overtime?

189
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:26,884
"Company"?

190
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,884
Where do I work?

191
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,124
- Are you still sleepy?
- Answer me.

192
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,894
You're a director at a
broadcasting company.

193
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:41,235
You always get summoned by the
Press Arbitration Commission.

194
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:44,664
Why did I become a director?

195
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,105
- Because...
- To find you and Dad.

196
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,175
In 1999, at Yeou
Gogae, my life...

197
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:56,175
No, not just me.
Our entire family...

198
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,315
got destroyed.

199
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,384
What are you talking about?

200
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:01,555
You're not my mom.

201
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,685
You can't fool me twice.

202
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:17,705
Stop talking nonsense and
come eat your breakfast.

203
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:20,205
You really need to stop
joking around with me.

204
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:25,274
- What?
- Stop bringing up the accident.

205
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:28,215
Your dad and I were
completely heartbroken...

206
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,144
back when you were
in a coma for years.

207
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,384
I was...

208
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:35,815
in a coma?

209
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:08,955
Do you remember what
you used to give me...

210
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,955
every time I went to the
doctor to get a shot?

211
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,284
Strawberry candy.

212
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,624
Now stop it and come outside.

213
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,534
Wait.

214
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,445
What is it this time?

215
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:33,575
I want...

216
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,374
walnut cookies.

217
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:39,485
Walnut cookies?

218
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:47,994
Mom, I want...

219
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:49,925
walnut cookies.

220
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,164
We never buy walnut cookies.

221
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:56,034
I had to go to the hospital
because it turned out...

222
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:57,365
I was allergic to nuts.

223
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,304
Oh, right. I forgot.

224
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,034
You're not my mom.

225
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,834
Where's my mom?

226
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:06,274
I am your mom.

227
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,294
Stop talking nonsense.

228
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,064
My goodness, you're
allergic to nuts.

229
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,294
She got to meet
her family again?

230
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,725
How nice.

231
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:04,064
I thought her fear would be those
fake parents, but I guess not.

232
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,865
I guess that's not...

233
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:09,004
what she's really scared of.

234
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:10,945
It looks like her family
is what drags her down...

235
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,274
just like how it was
in her past life.

236
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:21,584
Is it getting colder?

237
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:24,824
Her subconscious
created this place.

238
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:26,354
She probably won't welcome us...

239
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:28,655
since we're outsiders.

240
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:30,554
Let's go.

241
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:46,645
Nice! Cheesecake!

242
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,814
Did you see?

243
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,215
My plan failed.

244
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,354
Yeon didn't show.

245
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:57,415
Then why are you back?

246
00:19:57,415 --> 00:20:01,254
She can try to use her brain,
but she won't get out alive.

247
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:03,494
When you really look at it,

248
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:07,264
the mind is much more
fragile than they think.

249
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:10,334
It's the world that the lifelong
wounds of the heart created.

250
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,935
If she dies in there,
will she die for real?

251
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,705
Do you want to try too?

252
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,415
Let go of me!

253
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,215
- Spirit of Darkness.
- Yes?

254
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,445
Don't touch my things.

255
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,354
I was just playing.

256
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:33,125
Forgive me.

257
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,425
There was a lot more
after "Forgive me."

258
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,435
"He may be Imoogi but was
asleep for over 600 years."

259
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,205
"He can't be as strong
as he used to be."

260
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,475
"Why don't you..."

261
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,344
"try me?"

262
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,175
I want to see as well.

263
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,455
How dare I think such a thing?

264
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:09,925
Please forgive me.

265
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,024
Please forgive me.

266
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:19,165
Will you please give me a hug?

267
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,175
Mom.

268
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,385
My mom.

269
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,415
It's okay if it's a dream.

270
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:37,885
Please don't go.

271
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,955
Don't leave me all alone.

272
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,425
Did you have a
scary dream again?

273
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:50,764
Yes.

274
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:54,975
I wish it were all a dream.

275
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:01,875
What was the dream about?

276
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:05,084
About losing...

277
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:07,514
you and Dad.

278
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,425
Why are you crying?
It was just a dream.

279
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,494
I'm sorry...

280
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:23,435
for surviving alone.

281
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:33,604
I tried to be strong
all this time,

282
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:39,084
but to be honest, I was
terribly scared and lonely.

283
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:44,554
I hated going home,
so I used to sit...

284
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:48,094
at a bus stop for hours.

285
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:51,895
I'm sorry, Mom.

286
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,395
To be honest,

287
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:01,435
I hated you and Dad a little..

288
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,574
You left me all alone,

289
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,074
and you wouldn't come back
no matter how long I waited.

290
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,485
You didn't forget me, right?

291
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:20,584
How could I forget...

292
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,494
a daughter this pretty?

293
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:30,665
I've missed you, Mom.

294
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:56,294
We've been going in circles.

295
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,665
We don't have time for this.

296
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,395
I wonder if Ji A is okay.

297
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:04,705
Please. Please hang
on a little longer.

298
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:10,375
Let go.

299
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,274
You're in no
condition to be proud.

300
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,574
I'm a corpse without my pride.

301
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:19,885
You look like a corpse already.

302
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,524
You've heard of
phantom pain, right?

303
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,965
You mean how a soldier who
lost his leg in a war...

304
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:35,195
complains of pain in his
leg all night long, right?

305
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:37,735
The moment you sense pain in
a leg that is not there...

306
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,564
is when true pain begins.

307
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:44,004
Once pain begins, the door
will have disappeared.

308
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,604
That is the world
she shows them.

309
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:53,284
Doorkeeper, doorkeeper,
open the door

310
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:57,115
I can't I don't have the key

311
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,024
- What is it?
- I can't go any further.

312
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:07,425
The poison spread
everywhere. I can barely see.

313
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:10,034
I'm sick of walking
with this leg.

314
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:11,504
So?

315
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,304
You'll sit here and become
food for evil spirits?

316
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:19,104
Go to your woman. It's
too late for me anyway.

317
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:28,514
You haven't changed.

318
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,455
You're just like
when we first met.

319
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:37,895
You still give up easily
and you still whine.

320
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:40,225
Why are life and death
so simple for you?

321
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,594
Because nothing
is precious to me.

322
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:45,764
I don't have a first love to
protect with my life as you do,

323
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:49,534
and I don't have a family that
I'm waiting desperately for...

324
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:52,344
as she does.

325
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,584
I shouldn't have come.

326
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,725
Neither then nor now.

327
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,695
I came to see you because I
heard you had my father's blood,

328
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,895
but you're pathetic.

329
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:15,034
You have no will to live either.

330
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:16,965
I wasted my time.

331
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:19,865
I'm leaving.

332
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:23,834
Once I die,

333
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,715
bury me in the woods of
Baekdudaegan where we used to live.

334
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,175
Am I your will?

335
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:45,824
I wish we could go
back to those days.

336
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:51,135
There were azaleas everywhere.

337
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:56,804
It's strange.

338
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,074
I can't remember how
the azaleas tasted...

339
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:04,244
back then.

340
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,455
If you don't remember
how the azalea tasted,

341
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:17,125
get out alive and
eat some, you idiot!

342
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,865
At least try to
survive, will you?

343
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:26,865
Be honest. Why
did you come here?

344
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:31,334
To save both Ji A and you.

345
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:33,945
- You expect me to believe that?
- I don't care!

346
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,875
I almost died by your knife.

347
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,814
You massacred an entire town.

348
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:43,554
- You deserved it.
- Exactly.

349
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,225
Why are you saving
someone you tried to kill?

350
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:57,334
Listen carefully.

351
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:03,074
My sword has never
missed, not even once.

352
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:04,375
I have never...

353
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:07,645
missed the target.

354
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:18,014
Think hard with that stupid brain
of yours why you survived my sword.

355
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:24,354
I'm leaving. And I'm
never coming back.

356
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,843
Boat number four just set
sail down Samdo River.

357
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:20,014
Tell the captain to
turn the boat around.

358
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:24,784
An elder in the ICU
passed away just now...

359
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,153
still hooked to the machine.

360
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:32,954
So where were we?

361
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:35,794
- The Spirit of Darkness.
- The Spirit of Darkness?

362
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:39,663
Is such a thing still
present in this realm?

363
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:42,363
After talking to her,
Mr. Lee and Lady A Eum...

364
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,833
I mean, Ms. Nam. Anyway,
they're out cold.

365
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:49,343
Please tell me how
I can help them.

366
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:52,474
You're in over your head.

367
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:56,383
The girl is with her family...

368
00:29:57,113 --> 00:30:00,153
and Yeon is at the
Forest of the Starved.

369
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:03,323
The Forest of the Starved?

370
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,323
Probably to save
his younger brother.

371
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,524
- Then his brother too?
- Let me ask though.

372
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:10,123
Since when were those two tight?

373
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:13,863
How's that the issue right now?

374
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:16,264
- It is to me.
- Honey!

375
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:18,804
He takes on too much
of the burden himself.

376
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:21,034
He's the kind that
digs his own grave.

377
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:25,514
That's what made him
a mountain spirit.

378
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,444
The spirit of the mountains...

379
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,883
had his heart touched by
each and every organism.

380
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,413
So how could he not
care for his brother?

381
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:33,484
Brother, my foot.

382
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,823
Rang committed too many crimes.

383
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,323
Honey, how can you be so...

384
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,254
Please help them, ma'am.

385
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:46,563
I will give up my life
instead, so please.

386
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:50,034
You're making a
fool of yourself.

387
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:53,234
Why give up your life for
something Yeon chose to do?

388
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,004
Please let me know
how I can save them,

389
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,413
and I'll do everything
you order me to do.

390
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,883
Everything I order?

391
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,363
Don't you care about your life?

392
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:26,073
How could you trade it in
for that piece of cloth?

393
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:32,014
I'm sure this is
what Mr. Lee wants.

394
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,413
You and Yeon both. It
must be a fox thing.

395
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:39,254
I don't quite get it though.

396
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:42,383
Why did he choose Rang
instead of Ms. Nam?

397
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:47,194
They're both in a world created
by their unresolved issues.

398
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:49,294
For them both, that's family.

399
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:53,694
If she is reunited with the
family she's been searching for,

400
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:58,873
there wouldn't be
room for anyone else.

401
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:04,143
There will be no way for
him to enter the house.

402
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:06,673
Do you mean...

403
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,184
Yeon probably already knew...

404
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,423
what he's up against.

405
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:22,663
Does an exit even exist?

406
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,633
There was an entrance, so
there must be an exit too.

407
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,734
I came through the wardrobe.

408
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:31,873
The wardrobe door
led to our old house.

409
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:36,944
Not the Forest of the Starved?

410
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:38,913
No.

411
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:41,444
Tell me everything you saw.

412
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:45,714
The village people came
with weapons in their hands.

413
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:49,684
My mom watched as they
beat me to a pulp.

414
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:53,024
- Then...
- The Forest of the Starved.

415
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:54,893
Yes.

416
00:32:56,694 --> 00:32:58,934
No wonder. I knew it.

417
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:00,863
That's why we
couldn't spot a door.

418
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:02,603
What do you mean?

419
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,873
Haven't you figured
out who that lady is?

420
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:07,034
Is it someone you know?

421
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,244
She's been gouging you
with your worst memories.

422
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:11,304
Are you saying...

423
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:15,343
What's her name again?

424
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:16,514
The Spirit of Darkness.

425
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:19,054
The Spirit of Darkness.

426
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,444
<font color="#00ff00">MISSING AFTER CAR
ACCIDENT AT YEOU GOGAE</font>

427
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:56,684
This room...

428
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,653
may seem like
mine, but it isn't.

429
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,733
Where on earth...

430
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,133
am I?

431
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:12,934
What's that noise?

432
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,204
Sae Rom.

433
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,144
What did the doctor say?

434
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,914
They ran every test on her,

435
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,874
but they can't figure
out what's wrong.

436
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:59,113
Unbelievable. What
on earth is going on?

437
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:03,153
Ji A, open your
eyes. Please wake up.

438
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:16,503
Up until a minute ago,

439
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,003
I was at the office.

440
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,795
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE</font>

441
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,284
The juice lady.

442
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:37,854
Miss, what do you fear the most?

443
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:39,954
It must be Yeou Gogae.

444
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:44,164
That's right. After
my encounter with her,

445
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:46,034
I was taken to Yeou Gogae.

446
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:54,693
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

447
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:00,543
Then what is this place?

448
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:07,014
Kiddo, are you
trying to starve us?

449
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:10,523
- Dad?
- I'm hungry.

450
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:13,593
- Dad!
- Goodness.

451
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:19,564
My little princess.

452
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:20,963
- Let's go and eat.
- Sure.

453
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,133
Come on.

454
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:29,399
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

455
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:45,523
The path ends here.

456
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:47,624
Just keep going.

457
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:49,823
Not on this leg.

458
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:51,923
A path and a door will appear
when you overcome your fear.

459
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:57,164
- I don't see any door.
- Don't be a wuss!

460
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,834
Stay strong and think of
what you fear the most.

461
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:05,773
What...

462
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:08,244
What I fear the most?

463
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:11,713
Being abandoned.

464
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:15,724
Mom abandoned me...

465
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:20,193
and so did you.

466
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,023
You've got to be kidding me.

467
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:25,733
I...

468
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,834
never abandoned you.

469
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:53,624
I see it.

470
00:37:58,724 --> 00:37:59,894
Let's go.

471
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:21,014
Make sure you stay alive.

472
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,334
Keep climbing!

473
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:52,284
Don't look!

474
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:55,253
She's not your mom! Don't look!

475
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:02,564
Mom?

476
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:05,693
Darn it.

477
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:10,934
Darn it!

478
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:28,383
No!

479
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,383
Mr. Lee!

480
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:00,914
I need to go.

481
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:03,124
Go where?

482
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:04,923
Where do you need to go?

483
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:06,253
To Yeon.

484
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:09,564
To Yeon.

485
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,793
I must go to Yeon.

486
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,293
Where are you trying to go?

487
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:15,704
To Yeon...

488
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,704
I need to go to Yeon.

489
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,204
Gimbap.

490
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,843
Dad, it's your handmade gimbap.

491
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:26,113
Yes, he made gimbap again.

492
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,584
The end parts always
taste the best.

493
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,744
- Let's eat the ends first.
- Let's sprinkle some sesame seeds.

494
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:33,253
Let's eat.

495
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:35,554
Let's try it. It's
going to be delicious.

496
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:39,923
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

497
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,423
It's delicious.

498
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:42,963
Ji A.

499
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:46,664
Thank you for the meal.

500
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,604
- The soup is delicious too.
- Really?

501
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:09,883
Spinach, carrots, cucumber,
ham, and pickled radish.

502
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:11,684
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

503
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:13,554
It's not that.

504
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:18,064
The ingredients are very
simple, but for some reason,

505
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:21,093
no other gimbap ever
tastes this good.

506
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,204
Is that a compliment?
It's a compliment, right?

507
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,534
My daughter just complimented
me. I'm so happy.

508
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:29,974
It feels great.

509
00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:33,744
- Eat up.
- Okay.

510
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,443
It's even more delicious today.

511
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:37,483
Really? Thank you.

512
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,084
Suddenly, I started to think...

513
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,923
that the life I've lived until now
might've been a long nightmare...

514
00:41:47,323 --> 00:41:49,124
and that this one
might actually be real.

515
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:56,334
If this is a dream,

516
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,173
I really hope I never wake up.

517
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:08,374
<font color="#00ff00">OFFICE LOUNGE, JUICE LADY,
YEOU GOGAE, WHERE AM I?</font>

518
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:16,983
What's going on?

519
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:19,293
- Is something happening to her?
- Hey.

520
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:21,753
- Ji A! Ji A, wake up!
- Wait.

521
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,724
Doctor! Doctor!

522
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:25,523
Where's the doctor?

523
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:26,934
Go get the doctor.

524
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:29,463
Doctor, over here.

525
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:32,104
It's delicious.

526
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:33,934
I spilled some here.

527
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,573
Your dad is unbelievable. Here.

528
00:42:37,673 --> 00:42:38,744
Thank you.

529
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,374
It's delicious.

530
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,653
Who was that just now?

531
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:50,323
Who was he again?

532
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,994
Does it taste better than the ones
I made for you when we got married?

533
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,624
I can't remember.

534
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:58,593
Why can't you remember? I
made you gimbap so often.

535
00:42:58,593 --> 00:43:00,334
It was too long ago.

536
00:43:07,673 --> 00:43:08,804
You must not be late.

537
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,374
If you're late, they'll never
be able to leave that world.

538
00:43:13,644 --> 00:43:15,814
We didn't do anything. We
were just by her side...

539
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:19,314
Where did she go?

540
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,284
- What?
- What?

541
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,874
This is all I can do.

542
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,744
I hope you both return.

543
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:57,724
This was when you made us...

544
00:43:57,724 --> 00:43:59,253
carnations for the first time back
when you were in kindergarten.

545
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:01,124
You know the safety
pin that comes with it?

546
00:44:01,354 --> 00:44:03,323
You accidentally poked
my chest with that.

547
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:05,363
And I ended up bleeding so much.

548
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:06,764
- I did that?
- Yes.

549
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:08,193
You were an amazing daughter.

550
00:44:09,804 --> 00:44:11,334
Don't we still have the
carnation somewhere?

551
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,733
I made sure I kept
it nice and safe.

552
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:16,943
Ta-da.

553
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:18,874
"Mom. Dad. I love you."

554
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:21,273
You still have this?

555
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:22,514
Of course. It's our
family treasure.

556
00:44:23,014 --> 00:44:24,244
My goodness. Let me see.

557
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:28,383
You really preserved it well.

558
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,184
Of course. It's precious to me.

559
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:34,823
- Let's see.
- You smudged your fingerprints.

560
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,323
- The phone is ringing.
- You're right.

561
00:44:37,064 --> 00:44:38,593
- She's adorable.
- Look at the other hand.

562
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,934
I know. Gosh, it's
all coming back.

563
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:42,934
- Don't you hear the phone ringing?
- She's so adorable.

564
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,334
Look at all the baby hair.

565
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:46,133
Exactly.

566
00:44:46,503 --> 00:44:48,673
- She has baby hair here as well.
- You're right.

567
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:52,304
- She's so cute.
- This was so long ago.

568
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:35,554
Hello?

569
00:45:37,784 --> 00:45:38,923
It's me.

570
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:40,423
Who?

571
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:42,764
Lee Yeon.

572
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:44,823
"Lee Yeon"?

573
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:49,334
I'm sorry I couldn't go
there to bring you back.

574
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,534
Who are you?

575
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:57,173
I think I know you,
but I don't remember.

576
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:59,644
You must remember.

577
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:04,014
You need to realize where
you are and why you're there.

578
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:08,653
You need to realize that on your own
in order to come back to reality.

579
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,383
What do you mean?

580
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:13,093
Come back, Ji A.

581
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:17,323
I'll always be waiting for you.

582
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,093
Don't hang up.

583
00:46:48,093 --> 00:46:49,423
You must come back.

584
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:02,673
I wonder who that was.

585
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:04,403
I don't know who he was,

586
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:07,043
but I feel like I left behind
something really important.

587
00:47:23,193 --> 00:47:24,363
It's a bundle of mugwort.

588
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:32,034
It's special enough.
At least to me today.

589
00:47:34,673 --> 00:47:37,003
I'm sorry I couldn't go
there to bring you back.

590
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:39,773
What if I've been bewitched?

591
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:48,713
You're here.

592
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:50,923
You must remember.

593
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:54,954
You need to realize where
you are and why you're there.

594
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:57,793
Come back, Ji A.

595
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,534
Did you sleep well?

596
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:03,733
I'll always be waiting for you.

597
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,564
You'll be able to
find your parents.

598
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,403
I'll make sure of it.

599
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:09,804
Thanks, Yeon.

600
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:13,573
Yeon.

601
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:25,253
It's the poison of
the evil spirit.

602
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:28,394
Do something.

603
00:48:29,624 --> 00:48:31,164
Mr. Lee Yeon isn't back yet.

604
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:37,104
No! You can't go.

605
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:39,264
I'll die if he dies.

606
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,974
I'll repay you for this somehow.

607
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,514
I'm begging you.

608
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:49,744
I'm begging you.

609
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:56,153
Help him. I'm begging you.

610
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:22,843
- Look at this hat.
- It's so cute.

611
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:24,184
Isn't this hat pretty?

612
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:25,443
- Did you knit it?
- Yes.

613
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:28,684
How is she so tiny?

614
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,084
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,883
- She's tiny even now.
- I know.

616
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:36,593
Ji A. Look at this.

617
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:39,894
It was the day you
started babbling.

618
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,193
You threw up on your mom's chest
right after we took this picture.

619
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,503
It was because we tried
new formula that day.

620
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:48,633
How do you remember all of that?

621
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,443
Gosh. Because we love you.

622
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:53,514
Because we love our
daughter's every gesture,

623
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:55,014
kick, babble,

624
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:56,943
and cries so loud that
it woke up the neighbors.

625
00:49:58,314 --> 00:49:59,684
I see.

626
00:50:00,483 --> 00:50:02,584
I was very loved.

627
00:50:04,224 --> 00:50:06,193
So cute. Look at that face.

628
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,653
So cute.

629
00:50:09,693 --> 00:50:10,764
Look at this.

630
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:13,394
You know...

631
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:18,664
How would you feel
if you lost me?

632
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:21,334
Why would we lose you?

633
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:25,704
I'm just asking.
Things happen in life.

634
00:50:25,704 --> 00:50:27,543
My gosh. Don't you worry.

635
00:50:27,543 --> 00:50:29,943
We'll search the corners
of the earth and find you.

636
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,584
- Of course. You're my baby.
- Of course.

637
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:37,883
I'll do the same.

638
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:41,923
I promise I will find you both.

639
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:44,023
What do you mean?

640
00:50:45,894 --> 00:50:47,193
Someone asked me...

641
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:50,633
what I feared the
most in the world.

642
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:53,974
What I fear the most...

643
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:57,903
is being parted from you.

644
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:01,644
What's wrong?

645
00:51:02,983 --> 00:51:04,084
Sorry, Mom.

646
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:06,883
I'm sorry, Dad.

647
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:11,624
I have to go.

648
00:51:12,253 --> 00:51:13,823
Where are you going?

649
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:16,023
- Honey, stop her!
- Ji A!

650
00:51:19,093 --> 00:51:20,664
If you walk out there,

651
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:24,863
you may never see us ever again!

652
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:26,064
Ji A.

653
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:29,034
Why are you trying
to abandon us?

654
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:31,644
I'm not.

655
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:36,914
Ji A.

656
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:42,054
Stay here and live with us.

657
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,753
This isn't reality.

658
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:46,523
Who cares?

659
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:49,423
Our family is happy here.

660
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:51,224
That's all that matters.

661
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:53,064
Why are you trying to be alone?

662
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:55,633
Mom and Dad are here.

663
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,104
I'm not alone.

664
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:03,043
Yeon is with me.

665
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:04,744
Ji A.

666
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,713
- Please.
- Ji A. Please.

667
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:12,343
I have faith in Yeon.

668
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:17,454
Ji A!

669
00:52:36,204 --> 00:52:37,673
That wench woke up too.

670
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:41,613
Isn't this cheating?

671
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:43,514
It looked like fair play to me.

672
00:52:43,514 --> 00:52:45,514
What should we do now?

673
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:49,153
- This is good enough.
- What?

674
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,224
I simply wanted to look
into the abyss of her heart.

675
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:55,093
And I got Yeon thanks to that.

676
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:00,994
Yeon.

677
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:04,764
You woke me up.

678
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,673
You said you'd
always wait for me.

679
00:53:19,514 --> 00:53:20,613
Where are you?

680
00:53:22,814 --> 00:53:24,753
Just where did you go?

681
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,704
So this is my
personal Underworld.

682
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,374
Consumed by loneliness...

683
00:54:17,144 --> 00:54:19,003
and dying in a world...

684
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:22,474
without her.

685
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:00,383
How's Mr. Lee?

686
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:02,983
It'll take a few days for
the poison to leave his body,

687
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:04,954
but he'll be fine in no time.

688
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:08,023
Why aren't you
asking me anything?

689
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:11,664
You can see...

690
00:55:11,963 --> 00:55:13,363
why I approached you.

691
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:19,974
You knew already.

692
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:24,573
I happened to see
you two together.

693
00:55:25,874 --> 00:55:28,414
I was taken to a junkyard
and beaten up thanks to that.

694
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:31,314
- By Mr. Lee?
- Yes.

695
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:35,113
Then why did you treat him?

696
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,323
Because I didn't
want you to cry.

697
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:58,673
Shin Ju.

698
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:00,744
Mr. Lee.

699
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:07,883
How's Yeon?

700
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,454
Is he back?

701
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:56,764
Mr. Lee. Please...

702
00:56:57,564 --> 00:56:58,934
wake up.

703
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:15,483
What do we do? Mr. Lee...

704
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:41,543
I wonder...

705
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:44,814
whether Ji A
returned home safely.

706
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:23,162
I wanted to tell her...

707
00:58:23,872 --> 00:58:27,073
how pretty she looked
when eating dakbal.

708
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,943
I wanted to wish her...

709
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:36,312
the most typical
good night's sleep.

710
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:41,053
I wanted to spend...

711
00:58:42,622 --> 00:58:45,153
more time with you
in this lifetime.

712
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,662
I wanted to protect
all your nights...

713
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:54,033
and all your days.

714
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:30,602
It seems like I'm
stuck here though.

715
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:05,872
I miss you,

716
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:08,443
Yeon.

717
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:24,723
Even a nine-tailed fox who
was also a mountain spirit...

718
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,122
can't do better.

719
01:00:30,162 --> 01:00:32,033
Hey, don't die.

720
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:34,403
It won't be any fun if you do.

721
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:45,943
At least he's not dead yet.

722
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:51,982
This sweet body of yours
will serve Imoogi...

723
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:56,223
and bring disorder
to this world.

724
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,432
Spirit of Darkness.

725
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:14,743
What on earth?

726
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:17,142
You're awake.

727
01:01:17,743 --> 01:01:19,943
Did Ji A get back home safely?

728
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:23,113
Why does that matter when
you're at the brink of death?

729
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:25,852
Please...

730
01:01:27,923 --> 01:01:29,582
Please tell me.

731
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:35,962
But I don't want to.

732
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,772
I'm desperate.

733
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,473
Please tell me.

734
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:53,812
Stop making a fool of yourself.

735
01:01:58,153 --> 01:02:00,752
Fine. She made it out.

736
01:02:01,682 --> 01:02:04,553
But she would've been
better off staying though.

737
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:07,193
First her parents and now you.

738
01:02:07,693 --> 01:02:10,292
She's barely
hanging on as it is.

739
01:02:13,093 --> 01:02:14,732
So she's back home.

740
01:02:15,602 --> 01:02:16,872
You're smiling?

741
01:02:19,772 --> 01:02:22,042
Of course. Did you
expect me to cry?

742
01:02:29,943 --> 01:02:33,182
It wasn't easy luring
you to this place.

743
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,682
What?

744
01:02:47,162 --> 01:02:48,533
Do you really believe...

745
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,732
that one lousy spirit could
pull me off that cliff?

746
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,142
You deliberately...

747
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:55,203
Spirit of Darkness,

748
01:02:56,203 --> 01:02:58,243
it's my turn to say
your signature phrase.

749
01:02:58,812 --> 01:03:00,912
"What do you fear the most?"

750
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,852
I am darkness itself and the
embodiment of your fears.

751
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,823
Why would I fear anything?

752
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,223
You're dying, aren't you?

753
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,593
People have forgotten
all about you now.

754
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,823
No one speaks stories
of you anymore.

755
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:19,993
You seek attention by
giving out juice boxes...

756
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:22,033
and take your anger out
on Ms. Snail Bride...

757
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:23,533
since she's more well-known.

758
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:26,602
How... How dare you.

759
01:03:26,772 --> 01:03:29,203
My brother couldn't
even recall your name.

760
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:30,272
Shut it!

761
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:32,912
You...

762
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:35,912
will be trapped in the
endless torment you created...

763
01:03:36,982 --> 01:03:39,453
and live wishing you were dead.

764
01:03:55,602 --> 01:03:56,932
Not so fast.

765
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,973
I see you forgot
one crucial detail.

766
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,142
This isn't the Forest
of the Starved.

767
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,752
It's the subconscious
of a mountain spirit.

768
01:04:13,113 --> 01:04:14,352
In other words, you're
on my home ground.

769
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:19,193
I can't see anything.

770
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:31,673
What is it that you want?

771
01:04:33,943 --> 01:04:35,272
Not you, that's for sure.

772
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:45,053
I found you.

773
01:04:51,122 --> 01:04:54,323
I'll soon be coming for you,

774
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,122
so sit tight.

775
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:25,223
The nine-tailed fox who fell
in love with a human girl.

776
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:28,193
Once again,

777
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:31,432
you'll be the one
to end her life.

778
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:35,662
That is your destiny.

779
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:39,173
I'd worry more about
your fate if I were you.

780
01:07:11,863 --> 01:07:12,932
Don't come to me.

781
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,533
Stay where you are.

782
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:18,932
From now on,

783
01:07:20,073 --> 01:07:21,472
I'll go to you.

784
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:48,932
I...

785
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,003
waited for you.

786
01:09:02,194 --> 01:09:05,164
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

787
01:09:06,043 --> 01:09:07,413
<i>Repay my kindness, Yeon.</i>

788
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:08,812
<i>No.</i>

789
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:11,253
<i>I was supposed to have it all.</i>

790
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:12,552
<i>I was meant to be the
mountain spirit...</i>

791
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:13,882
<i>and have that woman by my side.</i>

792
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,052
<i>You woke up late.</i>

793
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:16,953
<i>I want to break the contract.</i>

794
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:18,852
<i>It's not entirely impossible.</i>

795
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:21,262
<i>You must kill your brother
with your own two hands.</i>

796
01:09:21,693 --> 01:09:22,762
<i>I will.</i>

797
01:09:23,562 --> 01:09:27,092
<i>Sacrifice the mountain spirit. Then
you can have your parents back.</i>

798
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:29,132
<i>Yeon, if you give up your body,</i>

799
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:32,073
<i>I will let everyone else live.</i>
