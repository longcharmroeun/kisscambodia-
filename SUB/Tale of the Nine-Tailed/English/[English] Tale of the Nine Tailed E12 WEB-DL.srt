1
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:11,998
Mom.

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,109
Dad.

3
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:26,278
Is this for real?

4
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,249
Are you really my parents?

5
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,198
Mom,

6
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,938
don't you recognize me?

7
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:57,478
Dad, it's Ji A,

8
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,709
your daughter.

9
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,358
I get it though.

10
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,429
It's been over 20 years.

11
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:16,528
Our daughter...

12
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,638
is all grown up.

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,338
And you're still...

14
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:27,838
a weeper.

15
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,549
Do you...

16
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,649
recognize me?

17
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,489
As if a parent wouldn't
recognize their child.

18
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,459
Mom!

19
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,299
We're sorry for making
you wait so long.

20
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,929
I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,498
I missed you.

22
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,079
I missed you so much.

23
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,718
You and your brother
did a great deed.

24
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,359
For the first time in 20 years,
Ms. Nam will sleep in peace.

25
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,989
I deliver when I
put my mind to it.

26
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,788
- And your brother's deal?
- Over and done.

27
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:19,829
That's so cool.

28
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:21,399
Praise me more.

29
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,598
Life is so unfair.

30
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,169
How can you be handsome and
good at solving problems too?

31
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,169
You blind me!

32
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,509
Have you made up
with Lee Yeon then?

33
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,848
It's more like I let it pass.

34
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,248
But I don't like the guy.

35
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,519
Why not?

36
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,618
He's been hurting you
since like forever!

37
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,759
Don't tell me you'll
be living with him now.

38
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,088
I'm not insane, you know.

39
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,199
Just don't ignore me now that
you have your brother back.

40
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,528
What if I do?

41
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,169
I'll bite you.

42
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:00,639
I did a bad job
raising you then.

43
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:07,358
<font color="#00ff00">5 YEARS AGO</font>

44
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:32,538
This is what you do.

45
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,068
If someone bites you, you
should bite them back.

46
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,009
The world is cruel to those who
can't even scream when bitten.

47
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,479
I never asked you to save me!

48
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,479
I know.

49
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,718
Those who take others
in against their will...

50
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:48,848
and feed and care for them only
to discard them later on...

51
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,688
are the worst in
my book as well.

52
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:57,429
Which is why you're to leave
once you finish eating.

53
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:00,729
What?

54
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,519
I told you not to follow me.

55
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,428
Attack me.

56
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,129
Again. Right here and here.

57
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,829
This is the jugular.
Remember that.

58
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:15,939
Again.

59
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,369
Again.

60
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,079
Again. Again.

61
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:36,488
Mr. Lee,

62
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,798
I managed to hit the
jugular in one strike.

63
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,298
Good job.

64
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,379
How about I buy you some jokbal?

65
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:02,588
No way! Jokbal reminds
me of my sick past.

66
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,149
How about bossam instead?

67
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:09,059
No. Tonight's a
night for jokbal.

68
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,399
Darn it.

69
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,298
Gosh, don't do that!

70
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:18,869
How about half and half?

71
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,038
Sounds good.

72
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,108
<font color="#00ff00">MISSING PARENTS</font>

73
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:31,178
Goodness.

74
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,449
What is all this?

75
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:39,158
I passed out flyers at first,

76
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,259
but no one would believe me.

77
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,829
That's why I became a TV
show director instead...

78
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,499
to find you myself.

79
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,168
And I have now.

80
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,899
Ji A.

81
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,139
We couldn't be prouder.

82
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,579
How do you feel? Does
it hurt anywhere?

83
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,108
We're both all right,
so don't worry.

84
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,819
It's better to be safe, so
let's see a doctor soon.

85
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,548
It's that music box.

86
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,918
The accident at Yeou
Gogae seemed to have...

87
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,129
only happened yesterday.

88
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,028
Our world seems the same, but
20 years have already passed.

89
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,329
- My gosh.
- Where were you...

90
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,098
all this time?

91
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:26,869
I'm not sure.

92
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:31,639
I feel like I awoke
from years of sleep.

93
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,178
- You too?
- Yes.

94
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,509
Then...

95
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,218
What about this? Isn't
this your handwriting?

96
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,189
"Ji A, why won't you save us"?

97
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,588
I woke up just this one time...

98
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,499
and was approached by a
man with fair complexion.

99
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:57,668
He told me that we'll be able to
see you if I wrote that message.

100
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,699
He must've helped you.

101
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,369
No, it wasn't him.
It was Lee Yeon.

102
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,639
Yeon was the one
who saved you guys.

103
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,709
- Is he the guy we saw earlier?
- Yes.

104
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,348
What kind of person is he?

105
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,249
I'm all he ever cares about.

106
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,718
He waited to meet me
for a really long time.

107
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,629
And he even sacrificed
his life for me.

108
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,358
Is he your boyfriend?

109
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:31,198
- I guess you really are grown up.
- My goodness.

110
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,438
I must say, I'm very upset.

111
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,139
I always wanted to be the first
to know about your boyfriend...

112
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,908
and was looking forward
to nagging at you.

113
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,078
Go ahead and do it. I really
want to hear you guys nag.

114
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:45,178
There were so many things
I wanted to do for you.

115
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:50,589
Now that you're back, you
can do them for me now.

116
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:52,619
Okay, I will.

117
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:55,688
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

118
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,028
You grew up so well and
became a hotshot director.

119
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:17,149
<font color="#00ff00">JI A</font>

120
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:22,178
What's with the video chat?

121
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:25,448
I thought you might be
scared to sleep alone, Puppy.

122
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,519
- "Puppy"?
- Let's do everything...

123
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,558
other couples do.

124
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,389
Let's come up with
nicknames for each other...

125
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,759
and get matching rings.

126
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,298
And let's even do corny
stuff on the phone.

127
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,469
Like what?

128
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,038
Something like this.

129
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,038
You must be really happy today.

130
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:47,208
Yes, I'm happy. So happy
that I feel like I can fly.

131
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,708
Don't fly away.

132
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:50,609
Your puppy is going to cry.

133
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,288
Thank you, Yeon.

134
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,889
Thank you for keeping your promise
about finding my parents for me.

135
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:02,828
I wish all your nights will
be as happy as tonight.

136
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,729
I'll make sure that happens.

137
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,499
Ji A, let's sleep.

138
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:10,729
I need to go.

139
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:12,999
Good night.

140
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,038
Good night. I hope
you dream of me.

141
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:36,328
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 12: CATCHING TAILS</font>

142
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,828
I almost died! Those
crazy nine-tailed foxes!

143
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,918
I was just about to call you.

144
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:03,788
I almost had him, but it
turned out they tricked me.

145
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,058
Yes, I made a small mistake.

146
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:09,489
You lost the ground
cherries and hostage.

147
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,859
Thanks to you, I don't have
that many options left.

148
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,399
I can turn everything
back. Trust me.

149
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:16,798
So tell me.

150
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,099
Where are you right now?

151
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:22,369
I'm just outside.

152
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:23,609
I can hear everything.

153
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,778
I can hear how troubled
you feel right now.

154
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,278
Come inside. Then
you'll find out...

155
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,609
if it's life or death...

156
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,479
that's waiting for you.

157
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,568
I'm not going to die. No way. I
sacrificed so much to stay alive.

158
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,769
I'm not going to die. No. Never.

159
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,609
Why am I here?

160
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:17,849
Welcome.

161
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:23,889
Imoogi.

162
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,328
I prefer being called
Terry than Imoogi.

163
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,068
It was the first name
you ever called me by.

164
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:33,999
So this was your doing?

165
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,708
How did you bring me here?

166
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:40,038
I didn't bring you
here. You called me.

167
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,048
- What?
- This is your dream.

168
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,548
And it means we're
communing with each other.

169
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,448
Cut the nonsense. I'm not
interested in communing with you.

170
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:52,788
We're bound to
each other by fate.

171
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,818
Go away. Just get lost!

172
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,269
Look carefully. I am you.

173
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,038
I need to catch Imoogi.

174
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,408
But I must do it in a way
that Ji A won't get hurt.

175
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,749
Then...

176
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,149
where should I start?

177
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,698
It's me, Yeon.

178
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,198
I don't find it fancy
talking to you either.

179
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,339
I called thinking you'd need
something like ground cherries,

180
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,168
but forget it if
you're not interested.

181
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,208
Really?

182
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:55,578
Then let's meet.

183
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:01,178
Yes, forget everything else.

184
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,918
I just need those
ground cherries.

185
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,058
Forget about Imoogi and Lee Yeon.
I don't care about them anymore.

186
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:15,129
<font color="#00ff00">WE CAME RUNNING TO YOU.</font>

187
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,158
Ta-da.

188
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:17,999
What's this?

189
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,298
It's a new cell phone.

190
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,509
I didn't have to go
to a cell phone store,

191
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:25,708
so someone ordered it for me.

192
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:27,038
Someone ordered it?

193
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:28,879
They even deliver
cell phones now?

194
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,048
They deliver it to you within
an hour upon your order.

195
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,678
- That's so interesting.
- Here.

196
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,489
If you press this, it'll
start calling my number.

197
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,677
<font color="#00ff00">MY LOVELY DAUGHTER,
MY LOVELY MOM</font>

198
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:47,298
Don't answer anyone
else's calls.

199
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,058
Don't open the door
for strangers either.

200
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,769
Don't worry and go to work.

201
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,239
I know it'll take some time for
us to get used to living in 2020.

202
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,269
But your dad and I aren't kids.

203
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,008
You can lean on me. It's okay.

204
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:07,619
Ji A, we should
eat with that guy.

205
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,018
Who?

206
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,619
Yeon?

207
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,218
"Fate and connection"?

208
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,629
He showed up in your dream
and said that stuff to you?

209
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,289
I don't think it
was a normal dream.

210
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,768
My face was covered in
snakeskin. It was horrible.

211
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,899
What if something deep inside me
is calling for him continuously?

212
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,539
What if that's it?

213
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:34,738
Why me of all people?

214
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,978
I'll catch him no matter what.

215
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:43,789
You trust me, right?

216
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,018
I trust you.

217
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,029
Oh, by the way,

218
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,158
Are you free for dinner tonight?

219
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,168
Dinner?

220
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,468
My mom and dad want to meet...

221
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,369
my boyfriend.

222
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:04,869
That's me.

223
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:06,978
Yes.

224
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:17,748
Would you take a
look at the kitty?

225
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,418
I'm sorry, but
I'm on my way out.

226
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,329
- Is it hurt?
- It was a stray cat.

227
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,559
I think it got caught in a trap.

228
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,158
I'll pay for the
treatment. Please.

229
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,268
What a good young man.

230
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:33,198
Bring him over.

231
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,238
Here.

232
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,879
Did that hurt?

233
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,109
It's okay.

234
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:47,779
Luckily, the wound isn't deep.

235
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:49,819
It isn't?

236
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,549
You poor baby. Who
did that to you?

237
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:04,698
What?

238
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,768
Who? Who did it?

239
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,678
What is it? Can the
cat speak or something?

240
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,579
Where did you find him?

241
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,418
On the hiking trail nearby.

242
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:31,728
It's Imoogi.

243
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:34,928
He is...

244
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:37,399
Imoogi.

245
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,069
These are lotus leaf
short rib patties.

246
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,039
They're on me since this
is a happy occasion.

247
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:45,809
Thank you.

248
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:47,779
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

249
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:51,809
Eat.

250
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,619
What's the job?

251
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,049
Tell us our rate first.

252
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,918
We're quite expensive.

253
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,988
I'll add a zero to the
current minimum wage.

254
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,228
As in, 86 dollars?

255
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,289
What should we do first?

256
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:10,668
What you do best as
people in broadcasting.

257
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,228
Get information on someone.

258
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,639
On whom...

259
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,039
Imoogi.

260
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,809
Fables, legends, folktales,
children's stories,

261
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:21,178
even comics are fine.

262
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,879
Bring me everything
there is about Imoogi.

263
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,218
- Why?
- Weakness.

264
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,218
I plan to find his weakness.

265
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:40,658
You're trembling.

266
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,899
A vet shouldn't be like that.

267
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,168
My apologies. Excuse me.

268
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,018
Touch that, and you die today.

269
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,529
You know who I am, don't you?

270
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,369
Koo Shin Ju, Yeon's
right-hand man.

271
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,609
So you can understand animals.

272
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,408
What do you want?

273
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:32,649
Yeon and I are playing
"catch the tail".

274
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,418
"Catch the tail"?

275
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:36,218
Which gets me to my point.

276
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:40,819
Are you a good hostage?

277
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,129
Just kill me instead.

278
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,059
I'd rather die than
become a weakness...

279
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,158
for Mr. Lee.

280
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:55,569
So that's the type you are.

281
00:21:57,508 --> 00:21:59,908
I'm not afraid. Kill me.

282
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:02,379
I guess this could
be a suggestion.

283
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:08,748
One day,

284
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,589
when the Imoogi inside
of her calls for you,

285
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:13,619
you will...

286
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,039
Imoogi killed us
in our past lives?

287
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,309
And that Imoogi is our intern?

288
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:39,478
That's not right.

289
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,389
Why are all the hot guys either
a nine-tailed fox or an Imoogi?

290
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:44,389
Sorry about that.

291
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:47,089
Okay, I'll let you guys talk.

292
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:50,289
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to submit my edits...

293
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:51,329
and go home.

294
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,258
I'm going grocery
shopping with Dad.

295
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:54,658
Should I drive you?

296
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,899
It's okay. See you at
home. Make yourself pretty.

297
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,238
- Okay, then. We'll go too...
- Sit.

298
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,879
Now.

299
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:17,589
I'll tell you something
much more important now.

300
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,789
I need know-how...

301
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,899
on how to impress her parents...

302
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,369
Here. Right here.

303
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:37,238
- Okay.
- They're so pretty.

304
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:40,069
- Thank you.
- Give me a taste.

305
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,279
- Here.
- Is it okay?

306
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,248
- Good?
- No, go in.

307
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,918
You seem to be doing
that on purpose.

308
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,258
What if I undo another button?

309
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:56,988
Seriously. Go back in.

310
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,099
- Is it okay? This?
- Yes.

311
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,099
So this is what they like.
Thanks, my part-timers.

312
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:19,948
Hey.

313
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,079
- Hello.
- You met him yesterday.

314
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:26,488
Let me formally introduce
myself. I'm Lee Yeon.

315
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:30,359
Nice to meet you. We figured we'd
eat and get to know each other.

316
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,389
- Let's go inside.
- Wait.

317
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:36,758
Remember.

318
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,529
"Thank you for inviting
me. This is a small gift."

319
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:41,668
At least red ginseng.
Or expensive cosmetics.

320
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,508
As in, show them
how wealthy I am.

321
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,978
Thank you very much
for inviting me.

322
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,478
This is a small gift.

323
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:53,478
A lighter? I don't
smoke though...

324
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,758
It's the model that
I drive as well.

325
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:03,258
Please enjoy.

326
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:09,428
He's a very generous person.

327
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,799
Let's go.

328
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:12,299
Please come in.

329
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,698
- Yes.
- Go inside.

330
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:23,208
It's been a while since
I've cooked with Ji A.

331
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,609
I hope you like it.

332
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:28,819
To be completely honest, it
isn't really my favorite.

333
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,748
The bulgogi marinade
is a bit strong.

334
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:33,889
It's delicious.
Everything is delicious.

335
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,619
You're a very honest fellow.

336
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:39,589
Don't ramble when they
ask you a question.

337
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:42,099
- Always be honest and brief.
- Be honest.

338
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:43,569
How old are you?

339
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,928
You'll be shocked if I tell you.

340
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,668
Why? How old are you?

341
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:50,268
I may look young,
but I'm much...

342
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,438
So... He's 36 in Korean age.

343
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:57,178
He lived sort of abroad
for a while. Right?

344
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,309
Did you study abroad?

345
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,218
We met when we were
studying abroad too.

346
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,619
So? Did you go to
college abroad?

347
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:04,688
I didn't go to college.

348
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:08,488
Well... It's not like you
have to go to college.

349
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:09,688
I didn't go to
high school either.

350
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:11,329
I never went to school at all.

351
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:16,258
Then what do you
do for a living?

352
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:17,899
I don't have a job.

353
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:22,498
Well... You're quite
the free spirit.

354
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:26,168
But I'm rich. I gave
you a car and...

355
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:32,579
Stop it.

356
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:41,518
They said they were
going to break up.

357
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,389
- Right.
- But they're still together.

358
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:45,758
- Really?
- I was so dumbfounded.

359
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:47,428
Gosh, what if the guy
was being too clingy?

360
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,728
- Exactly.
- What options do we have?

361
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:52,599
- Isn't he pretty reticent?
- Right. I told her not to...

362
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:54,698
What would you like?

363
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,168
Before I order... It's so loud.

364
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,178
Pardon?

365
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,049
I'm so sleepy.

366
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,448
I want to sleep.

367
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:20,799
You're the Snail Bride, right?

368
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:23,998
- Why are you here?
- To eat.

369
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,329
Take my order.

370
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:29,299
Fine. What do you want?

371
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,539
What does Yeon usually eat here?

372
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:35,478
I'll have whatever Yeon likes.

373
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,678
So you're a college professor,

374
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:42,549
and you're a doctor, right?

375
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,619
And Ji A is a production director
who graduated from the best college.

376
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:52,359
I see I have nothing
to offer in comparison.

377
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:57,869
Still, I like your
daughter a great deal.

378
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,738
What about her do you like?

379
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:09,678
I've experienced a lot
of things in my life...

380
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,379
than you think I may have.

381
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,649
The years were cruel to me.

382
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,289
But funnily enough,

383
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,889
eating beside Ji A like this...

384
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:25,428
makes me feel like I'm
a member of this family.

385
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:28,998
And it warms up my heart.

386
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,198
Me too.

387
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,839
With my parents gone,

388
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,339
I tried desperately hard to
be all right in this house.

389
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:40,579
But Yeon made me realize...

390
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,109
that we're supposed to
live in the shadows...

391
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:46,448
of the people we can rely on.

392
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,279
I wanted to be that
kind of person too.

393
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,389
You grew up well. Both of you.

394
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:02,559
The food's on the saltier
side, but I hope you enjoy it.

395
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,468
I will.

396
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,008
You're not a bad cook.

397
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:18,448
Why on earth are
you after Mr. Lee?

398
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,079
He's been drowning
in loneliness...

399
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,119
and he only recently found
happiness again. Why...

400
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:29,488
There are many variations...

401
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:31,329
regarding the story
of the snail bride.

402
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:33,758
But every one of them...

403
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:36,998
ends tragically.

404
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:38,968
It's the same for
me and Lee Yeon.

405
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:43,539
One of us has to die
for this story to end.

406
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,609
Listen to my words carefully.

407
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:50,579
You...

408
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,718
Look at this one. My gosh.

409
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:07,029
- This is Ji A at 100 days.
- How adorable.

410
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:09,299
How can her hands and
feet be this tiny?

411
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,869
Even at this size, she
had quite the temper.

412
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:14,938
- Who does she take after?
- Not me.

413
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,809
As if. That was your
guilty conscience talking.

414
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:19,809
Ji A has her mom's
temper but my looks.

415
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,079
Oh, what was that for?

416
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,649
Should you be showing
my photos this easily?

417
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,619
You don't have any
bad photos at all.

418
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:29,649
Of course not.

419
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:31,789
Unbelievable. Is that so?

420
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,619
- Ta-da.
- What?

421
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,488
What's this? Dad,
are you kidding me?

422
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:38,428
Why not? You look adorable!

423
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:42,629
- You're pretty in that one too.
- Stick to the nicer ones.

424
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,639
Darn it.

425
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,408
I want him dead.

426
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,029
You're home.

427
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:01,101
You always drink Americano,
so what's with the latte?

428
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,671
It's to help me remember this
day that will be a one of a kind.

429
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:17,681
Who knew that such
a gentle moment...

430
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,381
could ever encase
my bitter life?

431
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,950
Was it that nice?

432
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:30,730
My mind wandered off when
watching your family photos.

433
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:34,131
I thought of marriage...

434
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,040
and having a baby
that takes after us.

435
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,171
I also imagined eating
gimbap at Han River...

436
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,171
and getting into an argument...

437
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:44,581
which I'd probably lose.

438
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,881
I never age,

439
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:51,050
but there I was
with gray hair...

440
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,851
with you by my side.

441
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,091
If I were human...

442
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,871
If only I were an ordinary human,
things would've been perfect.

443
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,291
Does life taste
bitter again now?

444
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,661
- Why don't I add some sweetness?
- Sure.

445
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,541
- What's this?
- Ta-da!

446
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,211
Matching rings!

447
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,711
I've always wanted one.

448
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:58,380
- Really?
- I was going to buy it for you.

449
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,050
You've given me enough.

450
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,021
All you do is give.

451
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,661
Do you like it?

452
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,211
Why...

453
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,941
Why would you?

454
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,641
No way. I couldn't have.

455
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,950
It couldn't have been me.

456
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:51,661
What happened?

457
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:56,271
I did it.

458
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,740
I... With my own
hands, I hurt Mr. Lee.

459
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,911
- I must've been insane.
- Why would you though?

460
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,610
I don't know.

461
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,650
Why did I do such a thing?

462
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,311
I honestly don't know.

463
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,420
Yu Ri, calm down and think.

464
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,820
I was on my way over after
receiving Mr. Lee's call.

465
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,331
Out front, I bumped
shoulders with some guy.

466
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,070
He said,

467
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,840
"I want him dead."

468
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,441
The rest is a blur.

469
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,240
- What guy?
- Imoogi.

470
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:41,851
It was probably Imoogi.

471
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:43,911
The guy you saw.

472
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,291
He controlled your mind
by planting a suggestion.

473
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,191
It wasn't a coincidence.

474
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,300
He approached you on purpose.

475
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,441
But why would he
do that to Yu Ri?

476
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,371
So he could send a warning...

477
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,570
to me.

478
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:15,311
"In every gain, there's a loss."

479
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,220
Rang rarely trusts anyone.

480
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:21,090
Imoogi used the one person
he feels comfortable around.

481
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:23,191
That's how...

482
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,791
a young and weak fox like you
were able to hurt him like this.

483
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,791
What a cowardly jerk. I should
go and teach him a lesson.

484
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,601
You're no match for him.

485
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,240
How is his condition?

486
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:47,851
Can he live?

487
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,950
I stopped the bleeding, but
he has shallow breathing.

488
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,981
He also has a weak pulse.

489
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,351
So what does that mean?

490
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,561
He's too weak right now, so
all we can do is watch...

491
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,391
Will you please do
something to save him?

492
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,130
What about the ground cherries?

493
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,900
We have the ground cherries.

494
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,141
I promised to give it to
Granny at Samdo River.

495
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,970
Can't we just use a few of them?

496
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,780
In every ground cherry,
someone's life is trapped inside.

497
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,280
You want me to kill people
so I could save Rang?

498
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,650
So what if they die?

499
00:38:25,981 --> 00:38:27,891
Then let me do it. I'll do it.

500
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:29,691
Mr. Lee.

501
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,860
Your brother's life
is on the line.

502
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:41,030
You're forbidden to kill people.

503
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:42,931
However,

504
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,941
if you don't break that rule,
you won't be able to save Rang.

505
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,670
I wonder what your choice is
going to be this time, Yeon.

506
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,291
Where are they? Where
are the ground cherries?

507
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,621
At my place.

508
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,590
Really? Then let's go.

509
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,161
No, you can't go.

510
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:12,501
What?

511
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:14,931
I was always curious.

512
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,570
Why didn't anyone else
come back as humans...

513
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,970
other than Ji A's parents?

514
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,981
It's as if he wants me to
use the ground cherries.

515
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,450
Do you think he's testing you?

516
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,121
If I break the rule and kill humans,
I'll get dragged to the Underworld.

517
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,650
It could last days or weeks.

518
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:39,621
Then I won't be around
to protect Ji A.

519
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,260
What he wants...

520
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:46,760
is my absence.

521
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,141
We're not going to use
the ground cherries.

522
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,240
I'm going to catch Imoogi first.

523
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,150
And I'll save my brother's
life in my own way.

524
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,820
Give them to me!

525
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,220
- Yu Ri.
- Give me the ground cherries!

526
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,291
Stop it.

527
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:23,400
What's this?

528
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,900
Hey, Mr. Nine-tailed fox.

529
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,570
Do you want me to
be your friend?

530
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,970
- No.
- Why not?

531
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,641
Your nose. I don't like you
because you have a runny nose.

532
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:35,711
Hey, you're the boy
with the runny nose.

533
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:37,780
What are you doing here?

534
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,061
Mr. Choi, do you
think I'm a joke?

535
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:51,090
No, of course not. I
don't think you're a joke.

536
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,300
Then why would you...

537
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:55,331
buy me flowers and drinks?

538
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:57,731
When you do that for a widow who
runs a restaurant by herself,

539
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,840
it just means you want to
spend the night with me.

540
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,070
It's sad to hear you say that.

541
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,441
To me, flowers and alcohol...

542
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:09,351
make me feel happy...

543
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,121
and give me positive energy.

544
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,291
I had no idea those two
things could end up...

545
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,791
hurting you like this.

546
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,691
I mean...

547
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,360
Why me?

548
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,030
You have a pretty
nice background...

549
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,700
I want to be with
you. No one else.

550
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:31,501
I don't think of you as a widow
who runs a restaurant on her own.

551
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,711
You seem very special to me.

552
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:39,280
I really mean it.

553
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,780
I feel like you're
hiding a lot of things...

554
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:44,481
behind those miraculous eyes.

555
00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:55,860
Yu Ri, get some sleep.

556
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,400
Can you go ask him for
some ground cherries?

557
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,400
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

558
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,170
Let's have faith in him
and give him some time.

559
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,570
I'm sure he'll find a way.

560
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,771
He's a jerk.

561
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,970
He's so cold-hearted
and ruthless.

562
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Rang is in this
state because of him.

563
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:16,581
To be exact, Mr. Lee didn't
cause this to happen.

564
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,380
He warned Rang many times that
getting involved with Imoogi...

565
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,550
will only bring him misfortunes.

566
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,590
Whose side are you on?

567
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:29,760
Rang.

568
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,661
Rang.

569
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:36,670
Rang!

570
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:38,300
Yu Ri.

571
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,070
Yu Ri, get up.

572
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:44,371
Is he sick?

573
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,181
Get out!

574
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:51,581
Soo Ho, we should go.

575
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,920
Is he also a nine-tailed fox?

576
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Who told you that?

577
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:00,291
He's the little brother of
that guy who was here earlier.

578
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,200
The guy who came earlier
is a nine-tailed fox.

579
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,441
Your brother's life
is on the line.

580
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,340
Can't we just use a few of them?

581
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:22,811
Give them to me!

582
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:25,581
Give me the ground cherries!

583
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,420
What's the disinfectant?

584
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,351
It's this one.

585
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:06,461
Don't put on airs.

586
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,630
That's not how you do it.

587
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,470
What do you know?

588
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:37,351
How do you know all this?

589
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:41,090
My mom got hurt every
time my stepdad hit her.

590
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:44,490
So I used to do this for her.

591
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:47,931
Really? Then I'll
leave you to it.

592
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:50,231
If anything happens
to him, I'll kill you.

593
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,601
Where are you going?

594
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:40,981
Rang, I'll save you.

595
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,331
Gosh, no!

596
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:27,760
Rang!

597
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,200
Rang!

598
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:42,050
Forgive me. I should've
stopped Yu Ri.

599
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,650
She managed to steal them
but they all withered?

600
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:48,220
- Yes.
- How is Rang?

601
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:51,050
He hasn't gotten any better.

602
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,490
Look after that
ground cherry thief.

603
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:56,590
She may cause trouble.

604
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:57,860
I'm sorry.

605
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:01,871
Should I bring the
tree to Madam Taluipa?

606
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:03,670
- No.
- Then?

607
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:05,470
Not yet.

608
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,371
I'm playing catch the
tail right now as well.

609
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,561
You look like you spent
12 years in 1 night.

610
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,061
I don't know where to
go to hide from him.

611
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:33,400
I'm dead.

612
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:36,300
You deserve it.
I'd kill you too,

613
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,700
if my right-hand man
caused trouble and hid.

614
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,170
Please save me. I'll
do anything you say.

615
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,570
Please give me the
ground cherries...

616
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:46,211
My ground cherries.

617
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:48,681
Don't you dare.

618
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,780
- Tell me what you want.
- Help me catch Imoogi.

619
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,320
The number of ground cherries will
vary based on the information.

620
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,920
Anything. I'll
tell you anything.

621
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,961
But how can I trust you?

622
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:04,130
From what I saw that day
when I was disguised as Rang,

623
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:06,530
everything about you was a lie.

624
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,300
I understand why
you can't trust me.

625
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:11,740
I wouldn't either.

626
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:15,441
But I didn't do it
because I wanted to.

627
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:17,371
Now, you say that?

628
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:19,510
I wanted to live.

629
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,450
I just wanted to live.

630
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:27,481
I know I'm staying alive
pathetically, but I'm still human.

631
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,490
I was an ordinary human
being at one point.

632
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:34,090
After losing my family to him,

633
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,731
I wanted to get
revenge if I could.

634
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:39,400
If I could get another chance,

635
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,130
I want to start over
as a new person.

636
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:49,970
Okay, okay.

637
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,211
Lift up your head.

638
00:49:01,251 --> 00:49:02,950
If you cry while carrying this,

639
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,851
would you or would
you not seem sincere?

640
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,661
You even rubbed evening
primroses on it.

641
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:13,260
How did you know?

642
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,800
People don't change that easily.

643
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,030
You're smarter than you seem.

644
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,541
But do you think you
could kill me with this?

645
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:20,740
It's not loaded.

646
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,141
I just wanted to see...

647
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,150
whether the former
mountain spirit...

648
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,681
is stupid enough to
fall for my tears.

649
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,590
I can't bet my life on an idiot.

650
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,220
Now, we're talking.

651
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,030
Records about Imoogi are similar to
the tales by the most famous one,

652
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,831
the Jeju Island's
Kim Young Suk tale.

653
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:49,731
The regions are different,
as well as the time periods,

654
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:51,771
but all the endings make
me a bit uncomfortable.

655
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:56,010
Right? If a beautiful woman
is offered as a sacrifice,

656
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,481
a hero appears out of nowhere and
defeats Imoogi after a battle.

657
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:02,751
But it's never a happy ending.

658
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:05,081
The protagonist in Kim
Young Suk's story...

659
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,450
stabs and kills
Imoogi with a sword.

660
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,090
But it says he was murdered
by the dead Imoogi.

661
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,220
He killed him,
but he didn't die.

662
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,590
Maybe there's more than one.

663
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,161
Maybe there were two
Imoogis from the start.

664
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,691
You'll strike Imoogi directly?

665
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,961
What do you think?

666
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,030
If I like your answer,

667
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,630
I'll give you the whole thing.

668
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,030
This is something
that only I know.

669
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,240
The shaman on the island
said he can never die.

670
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,411
He simply sleeps.

671
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,041
I know that too.

672
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,311
The question is, how
do I put him to sleep?

673
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,911
It's the same as
how you woke him.

674
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,181
Don't you remember? The
well from which he awoke.

675
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:13,121
You're not making sense.

676
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,521
Do I have to throw him
back into the well?

677
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,550
It doesn't matter, as
long as there is water.

678
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,820
What matters are
the ingredients.

679
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,691
"Ingredients"?

680
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:23,691
The bodies of living people,
the blood of the sacrifice,

681
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,070
and the power of one
close to a divinity.

682
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,970
A mountain spirit. My power.

683
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,981
You were the final
ingredient to wake him.

684
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,621
There are so many records
about fighting Imoogi,

685
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:55,061
but there's nothing about what
weapon they used against him.

686
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:57,561
- I found something.
- What?

687
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,200
Look. A serpent
that lives in water.

688
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,501
The protagonist fights the
Imoogi living in the swamp,

689
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,170
and he covered himself
in horse blood first.

690
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:09,570
Imoogi must hate horse blood.

691
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,711
Nice. Send that to him now.

692
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:20,181
Should I include
an emoticon or not?

693
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:22,791
What do you think?

694
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:36,100
<font color="#00ff00">IMOOGI HATES HORSE BLOOD.</font>

695
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,300
That's simple.

696
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,641
We just need those three
ingredients and water, right?

697
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:46,211
The problem is, he
wouldn't just sit back...

698
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:48,311
and wait for you to
put him to sleep.

699
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,651
<font color="#00ff00">IMOOGI HATES HORSE BLOOD.</font>

700
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,081
<font color="#00ff00">THE STRONG YOUNG MAN COVERED
HIMSELF IN HORSE BLOOD.</font>

701
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:56,550
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL MONSTERS: IMOOGI</font>

702
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,921
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL MONSTERS: IMOOGI</font>

703
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,891
I'll make him just
sit back and wait.

704
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,700
So I was thinking...

705
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,601
What? What are you doing?

706
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,601
I need the body of
a living person.

707
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,181
Hello, sir.

708
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:28,550
You want us to pick up
the ground cherry tree?

709
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,860
Okay. Leave it to me.

710
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:37,891
Really? Do you mean it?

711
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,831
Okay, okay. Take
care of yourself.

712
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,130
What did he say?

713
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,900
That he can catch Imoogi.

714
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:50,170
He got something out of his lackey
by pretending to give him...

715
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,240
ground cherries.

716
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,681
I'll go and confiscate the tree.

717
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,941
No.

718
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,780
What do you mean? Let him
have the ground cherries?

719
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,021
No. Yeon.

720
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:06,561
Yeon can't catch Imoogi.

721
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,661
What do you mean?

722
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:13,431
Because he's Yeon.

723
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:18,670
Because he's the Yeon that we
know, he can never ever do it.

724
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,280
Stay strong and think of
what you fear the most.

725
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,981
What I fear the most?

726
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,521
Being abandoned.

727
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:39,391
Mom abandoned me...

728
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:43,990
and so did you.

729
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,950
I will never abandon you.

730
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:07,920
I promise I'll save you.

731
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,331
I will catch...

732
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:21,731
Imoogi.

733
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,050
Jae Hwan! Sae Rom!

734
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,920
- Can't you hear me?
- It's no use.

735
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:48,891
They're under my spell.

736
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:50,561
Don't you dare touch them.

737
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,860
I'll kill you.

738
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:53,760
Go on a date with me.

739
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:55,260
Then I may let them live.

740
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,130
What?

741
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,200
Wear what I picked out.

742
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,070
Hello? Hey, you!

743
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:09,950
Ji A. These were by the
door. They have your name...

744
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,110
on them.

745
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:02,994
What do I do?

746
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:05,423
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan are
in trouble because of me.

747
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:07,833
Maybe I should call the police.

748
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:10,403
They will be fine.
I'll find them.

749
00:57:11,463 --> 00:57:14,074
I already asked Shin Ju
to track their scent.

750
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,273
There's no need for
you to meet with him.

751
00:57:18,374 --> 00:57:19,443
No,

752
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:21,443
I will.

753
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:24,184
I'm going to meet him.

754
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:27,954
Today's the day we catch him.

755
00:58:01,883 --> 00:58:02,883
They all suit you.

756
00:58:03,253 --> 00:58:05,324
The dress, necklace,
and everything else.

757
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,594
From now on, write down...

758
00:58:07,724 --> 00:58:09,894
"puppeteer" as what you
do in your free time.

759
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:12,733
I love the expression you
hold when you talk like that.

760
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:16,003
Let's just eat.

761
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:22,443
I missed you, you know.

762
00:58:24,603 --> 00:58:26,744
Can't a person eat in peace?

763
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:29,514
Shouldn't you be nicer to me?

764
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:40,324
One word from me and
they'll go flying.

765
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:43,523
Why me?

766
00:58:44,394 --> 00:58:45,423
Because...

767
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,233
I think you could lead
me to what I truly seek.

768
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:52,034
What you truly seek?

769
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,804
The thing only I don't have.

770
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:58,903
The thing I may have
lost since my birth.

771
00:59:04,713 --> 00:59:06,114
A long, long time ago,

772
00:59:06,954 --> 00:59:08,414
a ninth son was born into...

773
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:10,353
a prestigious half-blood
family in Silla.

774
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:13,894
The baby didn't let out a cry,

775
00:59:14,653 --> 00:59:16,423
but the mother sobbed.

776
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:20,864
The baby's limbs were
sunken like a snake's.

777
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:23,704
Its eyes, ears,

778
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,534
and even the voice
were deformed.

779
00:59:31,374 --> 00:59:34,574
What happened to the baby?

780
00:59:37,514 --> 00:59:40,114
His father who was a noble...

781
00:59:40,114 --> 00:59:41,753
tried to kill the boy,

782
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,184
but the midwife stopped him.

783
00:59:44,954 --> 00:59:46,554
She said it could curse him.

784
00:59:48,124 --> 00:59:50,563
Instead, the boy grew
up locked up in a chest.

785
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:54,063
Other than the midwife who fed him,
not even his parents or brothers...

786
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:56,364
came to see him.

787
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:00,733
A baby that doesn't
cry will be forgotten.

788
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:04,244
It was a human being.

789
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:10,344
You were human before
turning into a monster.

790
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:13,454
The boy was thrown to a
cave of plague victims...

791
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,184
and was...

792
01:00:18,923 --> 01:00:19,923
eaten.

793
01:00:28,264 --> 01:00:29,534
This is horse blood?

794
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:31,864
Yes.

795
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:51,353
Time flew and that cave became
a tomb for plague victims.

796
01:00:52,624 --> 01:00:54,923
And one day, a white
snake slid out from there.

797
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:59,293
Those who saw it called it "imoogi"
and regarded it as ominous.

798
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:01,563
That's how the story goes.

799
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:05,603
I figured it out.

800
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:09,244
The thing you truly want.

801
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:12,844
It's being loved by someone.

802
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,713
Will you help me get it?

803
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,184
And if I decline?

804
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:18,784
I'll kill you.

805
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:21,184
After I kill Lee Yeon,

806
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:24,054
I'll kill those you love...

807
01:01:25,684 --> 01:01:26,954
and then you.

808
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:31,894
Soon after, a virus will spread.

809
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:36,664
No one will ever be happy again.

<font color="#00ff00">"UNVEILING URBAN LEGENDS"</font>

811
01:02:49,074 --> 01:02:51,374
Isn't the air nice and fresh?

812
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:54,474
Sure.

813
01:02:55,914 --> 01:02:56,943
Are you waiting for someone?

814
01:02:57,414 --> 01:02:59,383
- No.
- You know,

815
01:03:00,983 --> 01:03:02,883
I don't think I
ever got my answer.

816
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:05,624
How do you feel about me?

817
01:03:08,324 --> 01:03:10,764
I'm sorry, but my
love's been depleted.

818
01:03:11,594 --> 01:03:14,233
A whole 15 years'
worth of my love...

819
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:16,103
is now Yeon's to keep.

820
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:17,934
What does he mean to you anyway?

821
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:23,773
Tell me.

822
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,684
How dare you lay a hand on
her? I should cut that off.

823
01:03:33,054 --> 01:03:34,454
I'm afraid you're
the third wheel.

824
01:03:35,253 --> 01:03:36,583
We're actually on a date.

825
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,153
Let me take you out instead.

826
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:41,853
I hate those who go
back on their words.

827
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:06,483
I wish to fly.

828
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:15,394
Got you!

829
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:23,233
I guess they didn't fly.

830
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:30,673
Not dry land but water is
the right place for Imoogi.

831
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,054
This is horse blood.

832
01:04:41,054 --> 01:04:43,224
Figuring out your weakness
wasn't cheap, you know.

833
01:04:52,994 --> 01:04:56,003
And this is my blood. I
guess our date ends here.

834
01:05:05,173 --> 01:05:09,014
No, Yeon. You've
got it all wrong.

835
01:05:24,894 --> 01:05:25,894
What's going on?

836
01:05:27,934 --> 01:05:29,063
What went wrong?

837
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:31,034
You went after the wrong one.

838
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:33,204
What?

839
01:05:33,204 --> 01:05:34,974
That Imoogi you're
desperately seeking.

840
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,204
The main piece of it
doesn't lie with me.

841
01:05:39,304 --> 01:05:40,344
Then...

842
01:05:48,684 --> 01:05:49,724
I'm burning up.

843
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:54,494
- What's wrong?
- My body is burning hot.

844
01:05:55,923 --> 01:05:56,994
Does it hurt?

845
01:05:57,264 --> 01:05:58,523
It's so hot.

846
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:06,603
It's okay. You'll
be fine. Please.

847
01:06:27,723 --> 01:06:28,824
Does it not hurt anymore?

848
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:32,664
Look at me.

849
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:47,343
Long time no see, Yeon.

850
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:58,153
She's mine.

851
01:06:59,824 --> 01:07:02,523
Get out of that body right now!

852
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,620
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

853
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:47,833
<i>I might not have a lot of
time until I lose control...</i>

854
01:07:48,804 --> 01:07:50,203
<i>of myself.</i>

855
01:07:51,144 --> 01:07:53,873
<i>Take my life, and
use it to save Rang.</i>

856
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:58,214
<i>I plan to put an end to
this exhausting fight.</i>

857
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:01,054
<i>This sword only kills evil.
It'll only kill Imoogi's spirit.</i>

858
01:08:01,314 --> 01:08:04,283
<i>You must stay alive until
the end of this fight.</i>

859
01:08:04,854 --> 01:08:06,153
<i>- No.
- Move.</i>

860
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:07,724
<i>You messed with the
list of the dead?</i>

861
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:10,964
<i>I won't let anyone take Ji A.</i>

862
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:12,323
<i>Come at me.</i>
