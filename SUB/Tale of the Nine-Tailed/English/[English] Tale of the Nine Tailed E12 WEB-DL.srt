7
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,098
Mom.

8
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,209
Dad.

9
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,378
Is this for real?

10
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:18,349
Are you really my parents?

11
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,298
Mom,

12
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:40,038
don't you recognize me?

13
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,578
Dad, it's Ji A,

14
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:47,809
your daughter.

15
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,458
I get it though.

16
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,529
It's been over 20 years.

17
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:05,628
Our daughter...

18
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:08,738
is all grown up.

19
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,438
And you're still...

20
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:16,938
a weeper.

21
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:20,649
Do you...

22
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,749
recognize me?

23
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,589
As if a parent wouldn't
recognize their child.

24
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,559
Mom!

25
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,399
We're sorry for making
you wait so long.

26
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,029
I'm so sorry.

27
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:42,598
I missed you.

28
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:48,179
I missed you so much.

29
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,818
You and your brother
did a great deed.

30
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:04,459
For the first time in 20 years,
Ms. Nam will sleep in peace.

31
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,089
I deliver when I
put my mind to it.

32
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,888
- And your brother's deal?
- Over and done.

33
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,929
That's so cool.

34
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:10,499
Praise me more.

35
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:11,698
Life is so unfair.

36
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,269
How can you be handsome and
good at solving problems too?

37
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,269
You blind me!

38
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:22,609
Have you made up
with Lee Yeon then?

39
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,948
It's more like I let it pass.

40
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,348
But I don't like the guy.

41
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,619
Why not?

42
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:34,718
He's been hurting you
since like forever!

43
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,859
Don't tell me you'll
be living with him now.

44
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,188
I'm not insane, you know.

45
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,299
Just don't ignore me now that
you have your brother back.

46
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:44,628
What if I do?

47
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,269
I'll bite you.

48
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,739
I did a bad job
raising you then.

49
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,458
<font color="#00ff00">5 YEARS AGO</font>

50
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,638
This is what you do.

51
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:25,168
If someone bites you, you
should bite them back.

52
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,109
The world is cruel to those who
can't even scream when bitten.

53
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:30,579
I never asked you to save me!

54
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,579
I know.

55
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,818
Those who take others
in against their will...

56
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,948
and feed and care for them only
to discard them later on...

57
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,788
are the worst in
my book as well.

58
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:46,529
Which is why you're to leave
once you finish eating.

59
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,829
What?

60
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:15,619
I told you not to follow me.

61
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,528
Attack me.

62
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,229
Again. Right here and here.

63
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,929
This is the jugular.
Remember that.

64
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,039
Again.

65
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,469
Again.

66
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,179
Again. Again.

67
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,588
Mr. Lee,

68
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,898
I managed to hit the
jugular in one strike.

69
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,398
Good job.

70
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,479
How about I buy you some jokbal?

71
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,688
No way! Jokbal reminds
me of my sick past.

72
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,249
How about bossam instead?

73
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,159
No. Tonight's a
night for jokbal.

74
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:01,499
Darn it.

75
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,398
Gosh, don't do that!

76
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:07,969
How about half and half?

77
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,138
Sounds good.

78
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:19,208
<font color="#00ff00">MISSING PARENTS</font>

79
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,278
Goodness.

80
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,549
What is all this?

81
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:28,258
I passed out flyers at first,

82
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,359
but no one would believe me.

83
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,929
That's why I became a TV
show director instead...

84
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,599
to find you myself.

85
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,268
And I have now.

86
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:41,999
Ji A.

87
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,239
We couldn't be prouder.

88
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,679
How do you feel? Does
it hurt anywhere?

89
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,208
We're both all right,
so don't worry.

90
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,919
It's better to be safe, so
let's see a doctor soon.

91
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,648
It's that music box.

92
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,018
The accident at Yeou
Gogae seemed to have...

93
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,229
only happened yesterday.

94
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,128
Our world seems the same, but
20 years have already passed.

95
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,429
- My gosh.
- Where were you...

96
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,198
all this time?

97
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,969
I'm not sure.

98
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:20,739
I feel like I awoke
from years of sleep.

99
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,278
- You too?
- Yes.

100
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:27,609
Then...

101
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,318
What about this? Isn't
this your handwriting?

102
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:34,289
"Ji A, why won't you save us"?

103
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,688
I woke up just this one time...

104
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,599
and was approached by a
man with fair complexion.

105
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,768
He told me that we'll be able to
see you if I wrote that message.

106
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,799
He must've helped you.

107
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:52,469
No, it wasn't him.
It was Lee Yeon.

108
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:54,739
Yeon was the one
who saved you guys.

109
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,809
- Is he the guy we saw earlier?
- Yes.

110
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,448
What kind of person is he?

111
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,349
I'm all he ever cares about.

112
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,818
He waited to meet me
for a really long time.

113
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,729
And he even sacrificed
his life for me.

114
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,458
Is he your boyfriend?

115
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,298
- I guess you really are grown up.
- My goodness.

116
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,538
I must say, I'm very upset.

117
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,239
I always wanted to be the first
to know about your boyfriend...

118
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,008
and was looking forward
to nagging at you.

119
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,178
Go ahead and do it. I really
want to hear you guys nag.

120
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,278
There were so many things
I wanted to do for you.

121
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,689
Now that you're back, you
can do them for me now.

122
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:41,719
Okay, I will.

123
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,788
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

124
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:49,128
You grew up so well and
became a hotshot director.

125
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:06,249
<font color="#00ff00">JI A</font>

126
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,278
What's with the video chat?

127
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,548
I thought you might be
scared to sleep alone, Puppy.

128
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,619
- "Puppy"?
- Let's do everything...

129
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,658
other couples do.

130
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,489
Let's come up with
nicknames for each other...

131
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,859
and get matching rings.

132
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,398
And let's even do corny
stuff on the phone.

133
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,569
Like what?

134
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,138
Something like this.

135
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,138
You must be really happy today.

136
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,308
Yes, I'm happy. So happy
that I feel like I can fly.

137
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,808
Don't fly away.

138
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,709
Your puppy is going to cry.

139
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,388
Thank you, Yeon.

140
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,989
Thank you for keeping your promise
about finding my parents for me.

141
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:51,928
I wish all your nights will
be as happy as tonight.

142
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,829
I'll make sure that happens.

143
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:57,599
Ji A, let's sleep.

144
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:59,829
I need to go.

145
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,099
Good night.

146
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,138
Good night. I hope
you dream of me.

147
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:25,428
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 12: CATCHING TAILS</font>

148
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,928
I almost died! Those
crazy nine-tailed foxes!

149
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:49,018
I was just about to call you.

150
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,888
I almost had him, but it
turned out they tricked me.

151
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,158
Yes, I made a small mistake.

152
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,589
You lost the ground
cherries and hostage.

153
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:00,959
Thanks to you, I don't have
that many options left.

154
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,499
I can turn everything
back. Trust me.

155
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:05,898
So tell me.

156
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,199
Where are you right now?

157
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:11,469
I'm just outside.

158
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:12,709
I can hear everything.

159
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,878
I can hear how troubled
you feel right now.

160
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,378
Come inside. Then
you'll find out...

161
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:21,709
if it's life or death...

162
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,579
that's waiting for you.

163
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:38,668
I'm not going to die. No way. I
sacrificed so much to stay alive.

164
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,869
I'm not going to die. No. Never.

165
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:26,709
Why am I here?

166
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:06,949
Welcome.

167
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:12,989
Imoogi.

168
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,428
I prefer being called
Terry than Imoogi.

169
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,168
It was the first name
you ever called me by.

170
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:23,099
So this was your doing?

171
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,808
How did you bring me here?

172
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:29,138
I didn't bring you
here. You called me.

173
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:32,148
- What?
- This is your dream.

174
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,648
And it means we're
communing with each other.

175
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,548
Cut the nonsense. I'm not
interested in communing with you.

176
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,888
We're bound to
each other by fate.

177
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,918
Go away. Just get lost!

178
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:52,369
Look carefully. I am you.

179
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:04,138
I need to catch Imoogi.

180
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:11,508
But I must do it in a way
that Ji A won't get hurt.

181
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:14,849
Then...

182
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,249
where should I start?

183
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:29,798
It's me, Yeon.

184
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,298
I don't find it fancy
talking to you either.

185
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:36,439
I called thinking you'd need
something like ground cherries,

186
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,268
but forget it if
you're not interested.

187
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,308
Really?

188
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:44,678
Then let's meet.

189
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:50,278
Yes, forget everything else.

190
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:53,018
I just need those
ground cherries.

191
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:57,158
Forget about Imoogi and Lee Yeon.
I don't care about them anymore.

192
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,229
<font color="#00ff00">WE CAME RUNNING TO YOU.</font>

193
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:05,258
Ta-da.

194
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,099
What's this?

195
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:11,398
It's a new cell phone.

196
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,609
I didn't have to go
to a cell phone store,

197
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,808
so someone ordered it for me.

198
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,138
Someone ordered it?

199
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:17,979
They even deliver
cell phones now?

200
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,148
They deliver it to you within
an hour upon your order.

201
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,778
- That's so interesting.
- Here.

202
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,589
If you press this, it'll
start calling my number.

203
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,777
<font color="#00ff00">MY LOVELY DAUGHTER,
MY LOVELY MOM</font>

204
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,398
Don't answer anyone
else's calls.

205
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,158
Don't open the door
for strangers either.

206
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,869
Don't worry and go to work.

207
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,339
I know it'll take some time for
us to get used to living in 2020.

208
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,369
But your dad and I aren't kids.

209
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,108
You can lean on me. It's okay.

210
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,719
Ji A, we should
eat with that guy.

211
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,118
Who?

212
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:00,719
Yeon?

213
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,318
"Fate and connection"?

214
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,729
He showed up in your dream
and said that stuff to you?

215
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,389
I don't think it
was a normal dream.

216
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,868
My face was covered in
snakeskin. It was horrible.

217
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,999
What if something deep inside me
is calling for him continuously?

218
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:19,639
What if that's it?

219
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:23,838
Why me of all people?

220
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,078
I'll catch him no matter what.

221
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,889
You trust me, right?

222
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:36,118
I trust you.

223
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,129
Oh, by the way,

224
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,258
Are you free for dinner tonight?

225
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:46,268
Dinner?

226
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,568
My mom and dad want to meet...

227
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,469
my boyfriend.

228
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:53,969
That's me.

229
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,078
Yes.

230
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:06,848
Would you take a
look at the kitty?

231
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:08,518
I'm sorry, but
I'm on my way out.

232
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,429
- Is it hurt?
- It was a stray cat.

233
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:13,659
I think it got caught in a trap.

234
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:16,258
I'll pay for the
treatment. Please.

235
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,368
What a good young man.

236
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,298
Bring him over.

237
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:24,338
Here.

238
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,979
Did that hurt?

239
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,209
It's okay.

240
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,879
Luckily, the wound isn't deep.

241
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:38,919
It isn't?

242
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,649
You poor baby. Who
did that to you?

243
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:53,798
What?

244
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,868
Who? Who did it?

245
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,778
What is it? Can the
cat speak or something?

246
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:10,679
Where did you find him?

247
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:12,518
On the hiking trail nearby.

248
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:20,828
It's Imoogi.

249
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,028
He is...

250
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,499
Imoogi.

251
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:31,169
These are lotus leaf
short rib patties.

252
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,139
They're on me since this
is a happy occasion.

253
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,909
Thank you.

254
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:36,879
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

255
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:40,909
Eat.

256
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,719
What's the job?

257
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,149
Tell us our rate first.

258
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,018
We're quite expensive.

259
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,088
I'll add a zero to the
current minimum wage.

260
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,328
As in, 86 dollars?

261
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,389
What should we do first?

262
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:59,768
What you do best as
people in broadcasting.

263
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,328
Get information on someone.

264
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,739
On whom...

265
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,139
Imoogi.

266
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,909
Fables, legends, folktales,
children's stories,

267
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,278
even comics are fine.

268
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,979
Bring me everything
there is about Imoogi.

269
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,318
- Why?
- Weakness.

270
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:23,318
I plan to find his weakness.

271
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,758
You're trembling.

272
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,999
A vet shouldn't be like that.

273
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,268
My apologies. Excuse me.

274
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:54,118
Touch that, and you die today.

275
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:08,629
You know who I am, don't you?

276
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,469
Koo Shin Ju, Yeon's
right-hand man.

277
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,709
So you can understand animals.

278
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,508
What do you want?

279
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:21,749
Yeon and I are playing
"catch the tail".

280
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:23,518
"Catch the tail"?

281
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:25,318
Which gets me to my point.

282
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,919
Are you a good hostage?

283
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,229
Just kill me instead.

284
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:36,159
I'd rather die than
become a weakness...

285
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,258
for Mr. Lee.

286
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,669
So that's the type you are.

287
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:49,008
I'm not afraid. Kill me.

288
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,479
I guess this could
be a suggestion.

289
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:57,848
One day,

290
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,689
when the Imoogi inside
of her calls for you,

291
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:02,719
you will...

292
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,139
Imoogi killed us
in our past lives?

293
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,409
And that Imoogi is our intern?

294
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,578
That's not right.

295
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,489
Why are all the hot guys either
a nine-tailed fox or an Imoogi?

296
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:33,489
Sorry about that.

297
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,189
Okay, I'll let you guys talk.

298
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:39,389
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to submit my edits...

299
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:40,429
and go home.

300
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:42,358
I'm going grocery
shopping with Dad.

301
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:43,758
Should I drive you?

302
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:46,999
It's okay. See you at
home. Make yourself pretty.

303
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,338
- Okay, then. We'll go too...
- Sit.

304
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,979
Now.

305
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,689
I'll tell you something
much more important now.

306
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,889
I need know-how...

307
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,999
on how to impress her parents...

308
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,469
Here. Right here.

309
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:26,338
- Okay.
- They're so pretty.

310
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,169
- Thank you.
- Give me a taste.

311
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,379
- Here.
- Is it okay?

312
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:40,348
- Good?
- No, go in.

313
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,018
You seem to be doing
that on purpose.

314
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:44,358
What if I undo another button?

315
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,088
Seriously. Go back in.

316
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:54,199
- Is it okay? This?
- Yes.

317
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,199
So this is what they like.
Thanks, my part-timers.

318
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,048
Hey.

319
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:12,179
- Hello.
- You met him yesterday.

320
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:15,588
Let me formally introduce
myself. I'm Lee Yeon.

321
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:19,459
Nice to meet you. We figured we'd
eat and get to know each other.

322
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,489
- Let's go inside.
- Wait.

323
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:25,858
Remember.

324
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,629
"Thank you for inviting
me. This is a small gift."

325
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,768
At least red ginseng.
Or expensive cosmetics.

326
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:32,608
As in, show them
how wealthy I am.

327
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:36,078
Thank you very much
for inviting me.

328
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,578
This is a small gift.

329
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,578
A lighter? I don't
smoke though...

330
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,858
It's the model that
I drive as well.

331
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:52,358
Please enjoy.

332
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,528
He's a very generous person.

333
00:25:58,899 --> 00:25:59,899
Let's go.

334
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:01,399
Please come in.

335
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,798
- Yes.
- Go inside.

336
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,308
It's been a while since
I've cooked with Ji A.

337
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,709
I hope you like it.

338
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,919
To be completely honest, it
isn't really my favorite.

339
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,848
The bulgogi marinade
is a bit strong.

340
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:22,989
It's delicious.
Everything is delicious.

341
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:25,719
You're a very honest fellow.

342
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,689
Don't ramble when they
ask you a question.

343
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,199
- Always be honest and brief.
- Be honest.

344
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,669
How old are you?

345
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,028
You'll be shocked if I tell you.

346
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,768
Why? How old are you?

347
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,368
I may look young,
but I'm much...

348
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:43,538
So... He's 36 in Korean age.

349
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:46,278
He lived sort of abroad
for a while. Right?

350
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,409
Did you study abroad?

351
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,318
We met when we were
studying abroad too.

352
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,719
So? Did you go to
college abroad?

353
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,788
I didn't go to college.

354
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:57,588
Well... It's not like you
have to go to college.

355
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:58,788
I didn't go to
high school either.

356
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:00,429
I never went to school at all.

357
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,358
Then what do you
do for a living?

358
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,999
I don't have a job.

359
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,598
Well... You're quite
the free spirit.

360
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:15,268
But I'm rich. I gave
you a car and...

361
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:21,679
Stop it.

362
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:30,618
They said they were
going to break up.

363
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,489
- Right.
- But they're still together.

364
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,858
- Really?
- I was so dumbfounded.

365
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:36,528
Gosh, what if the guy
was being too clingy?

366
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,828
- Exactly.
- What options do we have?

367
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,699
- Isn't he pretty reticent?
- Right. I told her not to...

368
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:43,798
What would you like?

369
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:48,268
Before I order... It's so loud.

370
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,278
Pardon?

371
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,149
I'm so sleepy.

372
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:56,548
I want to sleep.

373
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,899
You're the Snail Bride, right?

374
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,098
- Why are you here?
- To eat.

375
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,429
Take my order.

376
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:18,399
Fine. What do you want?

377
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,639
What does Yeon usually eat here?

378
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:24,578
I'll have whatever Yeon likes.

379
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,778
So you're a college professor,

380
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:31,649
and you're a doctor, right?

381
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:37,719
And Ji A is a production director
who graduated from the best college.

382
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:41,459
I see I have nothing
to offer in comparison.

383
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,969
Still, I like your
daughter a great deal.

384
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:51,838
What about her do you like?

385
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,778
I've experienced a lot
of things in my life...

386
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:01,479
than you think I may have.

387
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:03,749
The years were cruel to me.

388
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,389
But funnily enough,

389
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,989
eating beside Ji A like this...

390
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,528
makes me feel like I'm
a member of this family.

391
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,098
And it warms up my heart.

392
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:22,298
Me too.

393
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:24,939
With my parents gone,

394
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,439
I tried desperately hard to
be all right in this house.

395
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:29,679
But Yeon made me realize...

396
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:34,209
that we're supposed to
live in the shadows...

397
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,548
of the people we can rely on.

398
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,379
I wanted to be that
kind of person too.

399
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,489
You grew up well. Both of you.

400
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,659
The food's on the saltier
side, but I hope you enjoy it.

401
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,568
I will.

402
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,108
You're not a bad cook.

403
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:07,548
Why on earth are
you after Mr. Lee?

404
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:10,179
He's been drowning
in loneliness...

405
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,219
and he only recently found
happiness again. Why...

406
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:18,588
There are many variations...

407
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,429
regarding the story
of the snail bride.

408
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:22,858
But every one of them...

409
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:26,098
ends tragically.

410
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,068
It's the same for
me and Lee Yeon.

411
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:32,639
One of us has to die
for this story to end.

412
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:37,709
Listen to my words carefully.

413
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:39,679
You...

414
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:52,818
Look at this one. My gosh.

415
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:56,129
- This is Ji A at 100 days.
- How adorable.

416
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:58,399
How can her hands and
feet be this tiny?

417
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:01,969
Even at this size, she
had quite the temper.

418
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,038
- Who does she take after?
- Not me.

419
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,909
As if. That was your
guilty conscience talking.

420
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,909
Ji A has her mom's
temper but my looks.

421
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,179
Oh, what was that for?

422
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,749
Should you be showing
my photos this easily?

423
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:16,719
You don't have any
bad photos at all.

424
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:18,749
Of course not.

425
00:31:18,848 --> 00:31:20,889
Unbelievable. Is that so?

426
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:22,719
- Ta-da.
- What?

427
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:25,588
What's this? Dad,
are you kidding me?

428
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:27,528
Why not? You look adorable!

429
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,729
- You're pretty in that one too.
- Stick to the nicer ones.

430
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:38,739
Darn it.

431
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:47,508
I want him dead.

432
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,129
You're home.

433
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,201
You always drink Americano,
so what's with the latte?

434
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,771
It's to help me remember this
day that will be a one of a kind.

435
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,781
Who knew that such
a gentle moment...

436
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,481
could ever encase
my bitter life?

437
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,050
Was it that nice?

438
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:19,830
My mind wandered off when
watching your family photos.

439
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:23,231
I thought of marriage...

440
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,140
and having a baby
that takes after us.

441
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,271
I also imagined eating
gimbap at Han River...

442
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,271
and getting into an argument...

443
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,681
which I'd probably lose.

444
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,981
I never age,

445
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,150
but there I was
with gray hair...

446
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,951
with you by my side.

447
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,191
If I were human...

448
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,971
If only I were an ordinary human,
things would've been perfect.

449
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,391
Does life taste
bitter again now?

450
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,761
- Why don't I add some sweetness?
- Sure.

451
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,641
- What's this?
- Ta-da!

452
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,311
Matching rings!

453
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,811
I've always wanted one.

454
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,480
- Really?
- I was going to buy it for you.

455
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:49,150
You've given me enough.

456
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,121
All you do is give.

457
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,761
Do you like it?

458
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:12,311
Why...

459
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,041
Why would you?

460
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,741
No way. I couldn't have.

461
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,050
It couldn't have been me.

462
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:40,761
What happened?

463
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,371
I did it.

464
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:49,840
I... With my own
hands, I hurt Mr. Lee.

465
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,011
- I must've been insane.
- Why would you though?

466
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,710
I don't know.

467
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,750
Why did I do such a thing?

468
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,411
I honestly don't know.

469
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,520
Yu Ri, calm down and think.

470
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,920
I was on my way over after
receiving Mr. Lee's call.

471
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,431
Out front, I bumped
shoulders with some guy.

472
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,170
He said,

473
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,940
"I want him dead."

474
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,541
The rest is a blur.

475
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,340
- What guy?
- Imoogi.

476
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:30,951
It was probably Imoogi.

477
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,011
The guy you saw.

478
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:40,391
He controlled your mind
by planting a suggestion.

479
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,291
It wasn't a coincidence.

480
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,400
He approached you on purpose.

481
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,541
But why would he
do that to Yu Ri?

482
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,471
So he could send a warning...

483
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:59,670
to me.

484
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:04,411
"In every gain, there's a loss."

485
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,320
Rang rarely trusts anyone.

486
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,190
Imoogi used the one person
he feels comfortable around.

487
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:12,291
That's how...

488
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,891
a young and weak fox like you
were able to hurt him like this.

489
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,891
What a cowardly jerk. I should
go and teach him a lesson.

490
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,701
You're no match for him.

491
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,340
How is his condition?

492
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:36,951
Can he live?

493
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,050
I stopped the bleeding, but
he has shallow breathing.

494
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,081
He also has a weak pulse.

495
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,451
So what does that mean?

496
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:48,661
He's too weak right now, so
all we can do is watch...

497
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,491
Will you please do
something to save him?

498
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:56,230
What about the ground cherries?

499
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,000
We have the ground cherries.

500
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,241
I promised to give it to
Granny at Samdo River.

501
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,070
Can't we just use a few of them?

502
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,880
In every ground cherry,
someone's life is trapped inside.

503
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,380
You want me to kill people
so I could save Rang?

504
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,750
So what if they die?

505
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:16,991
Then let me do it. I'll do it.

506
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:18,791
Mr. Lee.

507
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,960
Your brother's life
is on the line.

508
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:30,130
You're forbidden to kill people.

509
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:32,031
However,

510
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,041
if you don't break that rule,
you won't be able to save Rang.

511
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:39,770
I wonder what your choice is
going to be this time, Yeon.

512
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:50,391
Where are they? Where
are the ground cherries?

513
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,721
At my place.

514
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,690
Really? Then let's go.

515
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,261
No, you can't go.

516
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:01,601
What?

517
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,031
I was always curious.

518
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,670
Why didn't anyone else
come back as humans...

519
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,070
other than Ji A's parents?

520
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,081
It's as if he wants me to
use the ground cherries.

521
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:19,550
Do you think he's testing you?

522
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,221
If I break the rule and kill humans,
I'll get dragged to the Underworld.

523
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,750
It could last days or weeks.

524
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,721
Then I won't be around
to protect Ji A.

525
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,360
What he wants...

526
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:35,860
is my absence.

527
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,241
We're not going to use
the ground cherries.

528
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm going to catch Imoogi first.

529
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,250
And I'll save my brother's
life in my own way.

530
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,920
Give them to me!

531
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:00,320
- Yu Ri.
- Give me the ground cherries!

532
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,391
Stop it.

533
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,500
What's this?

534
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,000
Hey, Mr. Nine-tailed fox.

535
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,670
Do you want me to
be your friend?

536
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,070
- No.
- Why not?

537
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,741
Your nose. I don't like you
because you have a runny nose.

538
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:24,811
Hey, you're the boy
with the runny nose.

539
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:26,880
What are you doing here?

540
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,161
Mr. Choi, do you
think I'm a joke?

541
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,190
No, of course not. I
don't think you're a joke.

542
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,400
Then why would you...

543
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,431
buy me flowers and drinks?

544
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,831
When you do that for a widow who
runs a restaurant by herself,

545
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,940
it just means you want to
spend the night with me.

546
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,170
It's sad to hear you say that.

547
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,541
To me, flowers and alcohol...

548
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,451
make me feel happy...

549
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,221
and give me positive energy.

550
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,391
I had no idea those two
things could end up...

551
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,891
hurting you like this.

552
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:07,791
I mean...

553
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,460
Why me?

554
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,130
You have a pretty
nice background...

555
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,800
I want to be with
you. No one else.

556
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:20,601
I don't think of you as a widow
who runs a restaurant on her own.

557
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,811
You seem very special to me.

558
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,380
I really mean it.

559
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:30,880
I feel like you're
hiding a lot of things...

560
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,581
behind those miraculous eyes.

561
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,960
Yu Ri, get some sleep.

562
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,500
Can you go ask him for
some ground cherries?

563
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,500
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

564
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:54,270
Let's have faith in him
and give him some time.

565
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,670
I'm sure he'll find a way.

566
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,871
He's a jerk.

567
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,070
He's so cold-hearted
and ruthless.

568
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
Rang is in this
state because of him.

569
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,681
To be exact, Mr. Lee didn't
cause this to happen.

570
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,480
He warned Rang many times that
getting involved with Imoogi...

571
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,650
will only bring him misfortunes.

572
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,690
Whose side are you on?

573
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:18,860
Rang.

574
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:21,761
Rang.

575
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:25,770
Rang!

576
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,400
Yu Ri.

577
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,170
Yu Ri, get up.

578
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:33,471
Is he sick?

579
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,281
Get out!

580
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,681
Soo Ho, we should go.

581
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,020
Is he also a nine-tailed fox?

582
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
Who told you that?

583
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:49,391
He's the little brother of
that guy who was here earlier.

584
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,300
The guy who came earlier
is a nine-tailed fox.

585
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,541
Your brother's life
is on the line.

586
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:09,440
Can't we just use a few of them?

587
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:11,911
Give them to me!

588
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,681
Give me the ground cherries!

589
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,520
What's the disinfectant?

590
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,451
It's this one.

591
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,561
Don't put on airs.

592
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,730
That's not how you do it.

593
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,570
What do you know?

594
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,451
How do you know all this?

595
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,190
My mom got hurt every
time my stepdad hit her.

596
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:33,590
So I used to do this for her.

597
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,031
Really? Then I'll
leave you to it.

598
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,331
If anything happens
to him, I'll kill you.

599
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,701
Where are you going?

600
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:30,081
Rang, I'll save you.

601
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,431
Gosh, no!

602
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:16,860
Rang!

603
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,300
Rang!

604
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,150
Forgive me. I should've
stopped Yu Ri.

605
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,750
She managed to steal them
but they all withered?

606
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,320
- Yes.
- How is Rang?

607
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:40,150
He hasn't gotten any better.

608
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:43,590
Look after that
ground cherry thief.

609
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,690
She may cause trouble.

610
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:46,960
I'm sorry.

611
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,971
Should I bring the
tree to Madam Taluipa?

612
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,770
- No.
- Then?

613
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,570
Not yet.

614
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,471
I'm playing catch the
tail right now as well.

615
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,661
You look like you spent
12 years in 1 night.

616
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,161
I don't know where to
go to hide from him.

617
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm dead.

618
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:25,400
You deserve it.
I'd kill you too,

619
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:27,800
if my right-hand man
caused trouble and hid.

620
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,270
Please save me. I'll
do anything you say.

621
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:33,670
Please give me the
ground cherries...

622
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,311
My ground cherries.

623
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,781
Don't you dare.

624
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,880
- Tell me what you want.
- Help me catch Imoogi.

625
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,420
The number of ground cherries will
vary based on the information.

626
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,020
Anything. I'll
tell you anything.

627
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,061
But how can I trust you?

628
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,230
From what I saw that day
when I was disguised as Rang,

629
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,630
everything about you was a lie.

630
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,400
I understand why
you can't trust me.

631
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,840
I wouldn't either.

632
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,541
But I didn't do it
because I wanted to.

633
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:06,471
Now, you say that?

634
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,610
I wanted to live.

635
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,550
I just wanted to live.

636
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:16,581
I know I'm staying alive
pathetically, but I'm still human.

637
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,590
I was an ordinary human
being at one point.

638
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,190
After losing my family to him,

639
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,831
I wanted to get
revenge if I could.

640
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:28,500
If I could get another chance,

641
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,230
I want to start over
as a new person.

642
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,070
Okay, okay.

643
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,311
Lift up your head.

644
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:52,050
If you cry while carrying this,

645
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,951
would you or would
you not seem sincere?

646
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,761
You even rubbed evening
primroses on it.

647
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:02,360
How did you know?

648
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,900
People don't change that easily.

649
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,130
You're smarter than you seem.

650
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,641
But do you think you
could kill me with this?

651
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:09,840
It's not loaded.

652
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,241
I just wanted to see...

653
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,250
whether the former
mountain spirit...

654
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,781
is stupid enough to
fall for my tears.

655
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,690
I can't bet my life on an idiot.

656
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,320
Now, we're talking.

657
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,130
Records about Imoogi are similar to
the tales by the most famous one,

658
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,931
the Jeju Island's
Kim Young Suk tale.

659
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:38,831
The regions are different,
as well as the time periods,

660
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:40,871
but all the endings make
me a bit uncomfortable.

661
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:45,110
Right? If a beautiful woman
is offered as a sacrifice,

662
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,581
a hero appears out of nowhere and
defeats Imoogi after a battle.

663
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,851
But it's never a happy ending.

664
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:54,181
The protagonist in Kim
Young Suk's story...

665
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,550
stabs and kills
Imoogi with a sword.

666
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,190
But it says he was murdered
by the dead Imoogi.

667
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,320
He killed him,
but he didn't die.

668
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,690
Maybe there's more than one.

669
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,261
Maybe there were two
Imoogis from the start.

670
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,791
You'll strike Imoogi directly?

671
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,061
What do you think?

672
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:39,130
If I like your answer,

673
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,730
I'll give you the whole thing.

674
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,130
This is something
that only I know.

675
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,340
The shaman on the island
said he can never die.

676
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,511
He simply sleeps.

677
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,141
I know that too.

678
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,411
The question is, how
do I put him to sleep?

679
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:57,011
It's the same as
how you woke him.

680
00:51:57,011 --> 00:51:59,281
Don't you remember? The
well from which he awoke.

681
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:02,221
You're not making sense.

682
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,621
Do I have to throw him
back into the well?

683
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,650
It doesn't matter, as
long as there is water.

684
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,920
What matters are
the ingredients.

685
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,791
"Ingredients"?

686
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,791
The bodies of living people,
the blood of the sacrifice,

687
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:18,170
and the power of one
close to a divinity.

688
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:24,070
A mountain spirit. My power.

689
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,081
You were the final
ingredient to wake him.

690
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,721
There are so many records
about fighting Imoogi,

691
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,161
but there's nothing about what
weapon they used against him.

692
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,661
- I found something.
- What?

693
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,300
Look. A serpent
that lives in water.

694
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,601
The protagonist fights the
Imoogi living in the swamp,

695
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:56,270
and he covered himself
in horse blood first.

696
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:58,670
Imoogi must hate horse blood.

697
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,811
Nice. Send that to him now.

698
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:09,281
Should I include
an emoticon or not?

699
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,891
What do you think?

700
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,200
<font color="#00ff00">IMOOGI HATES HORSE BLOOD.</font>

701
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,400
That's simple.

702
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,741
We just need those three
ingredients and water, right?

703
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,311
The problem is, he
wouldn't just sit back...

704
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:37,411
and wait for you to
put him to sleep.

705
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,751
<font color="#00ff00">IMOOGI HATES HORSE BLOOD.</font>

706
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,181
<font color="#00ff00">THE STRONG YOUNG MAN COVERED
HIMSELF IN HORSE BLOOD.</font>

707
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:45,650
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL MONSTERS: IMOOGI</font>

708
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,021
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL MONSTERS: IMOOGI</font>

709
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,991
I'll make him just
sit back and wait.

710
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,800
So I was thinking...

711
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,701
What? What are you doing?

712
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,701
I need the body of
a living person.

713
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,281
Hello, sir.

714
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:17,650
You want us to pick up
the ground cherry tree?

715
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,960
Okay. Leave it to me.

716
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,991
Really? Do you mean it?

717
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,931
Okay, okay. Take
care of yourself.

718
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,230
What did he say?

719
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That he can catch Imoogi.

720
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,270
He got something out of his lackey
by pretending to give him...

721
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,340
ground cherries.

722
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,781
I'll go and confiscate the tree.

723
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,041
No.

724
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,880
What do you mean? Let him
have the ground cherries?

725
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,121
No. Yeon.

726
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,661
Yeon can't catch Imoogi.

727
00:54:58,391 --> 00:54:59,761
What do you mean?

728
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:02,531
Because he's Yeon.

729
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:07,770
Because he's the Yeon that we
know, he can never ever do it.

730
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:19,380
Stay strong and think of
what you fear the most.

731
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,081
What I fear the most?

732
00:55:23,451 --> 00:55:24,621
Being abandoned.

733
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:28,491
Mom abandoned me...

734
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,090
and so did you.

735
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:52,050
I will never abandon you.

736
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,020
I promise I'll save you.

737
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,431
I will catch...

738
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:10,831
Imoogi.

739
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,150
Jae Hwan! Sae Rom!

740
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,020
- Can't you hear me?
- It's no use.

741
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:37,991
They're under my spell.

742
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,661
Don't you dare touch them.

743
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,960
I'll kill you.

744
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:42,860
Go on a date with me.

745
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:44,360
Then I may let them live.

746
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,230
What?

747
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,300
Wear what I picked out.

748
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,170
Hello? Hey, you!

749
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:59,050
Ji A. These were by the
door. They have your name...

750
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,210
on them.

751
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:52,094
What do I do?

752
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:54,523
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan are
in trouble because of me.

753
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:56,933
Maybe I should call the police.

754
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:59,503
They will be fine.
I'll find them.

755
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:03,174
I already asked Shin Ju
to track their scent.

756
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:05,373
There's no need for
you to meet with him.

757
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:08,543
No,

758
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:10,543
I will.

759
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:13,284
I'm going to meet him.

760
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:17,054
Today's the day we catch him.

761
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:51,983
They all suit you.

762
00:58:52,353 --> 00:58:54,424
The dress, necklace,
and everything else.

763
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:56,694
From now on, write down...

764
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,994
"puppeteer" as what you
do in your free time.

765
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,833
I love the expression you
hold when you talk like that.

766
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,103
Let's just eat.

767
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,543
I missed you, you know.

768
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:15,844
Can't a person eat in peace?

769
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:18,614
Shouldn't you be nicer to me?

770
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:29,424
One word from me and
they'll go flying.

771
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:32,623
Why me?

772
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:34,523
Because...

773
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:38,333
I think you could lead
me to what I truly seek.

774
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,134
What you truly seek?

775
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:42,904
The thing only I don't have.

776
00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:48,003
The thing I may have
lost since my birth.

777
00:59:53,813 --> 00:59:55,214
A long, long time ago,

778
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,514
a ninth son was born into...

779
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:59,453
a prestigious half-blood
family in Silla.

780
01:00:00,824 --> 01:00:02,994
The baby didn't let out a cry,

781
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:05,523
but the mother sobbed.

782
01:00:06,824 --> 01:00:09,964
The baby's limbs were
sunken like a snake's.

783
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:12,804
Its eyes, ears,

784
01:00:13,703 --> 01:00:16,634
and even the voice
were deformed.

785
01:00:20,474 --> 01:00:23,674
What happened to the baby?

786
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:29,214
His father who was a noble...

787
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:30,853
tried to kill the boy,

788
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:33,284
but the midwife stopped him.

789
01:00:34,054 --> 01:00:35,654
She said it could curse him.

790
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:39,663
Instead, the boy grew
up locked up in a chest.

791
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:43,163
Other than the midwife who fed him,
not even his parents or brothers...

792
01:00:44,163 --> 01:00:45,464
came to see him.

793
01:00:47,964 --> 01:00:49,833
A baby that doesn't
cry will be forgotten.

794
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:53,344
It was a human being.

795
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:59,444
You were human before
turning into a monster.

796
01:01:00,313 --> 01:01:02,554
The boy was thrown to a
cave of plague victims...

797
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:05,284
and was...

798
01:01:08,023 --> 01:01:09,023
eaten.

799
01:01:17,364 --> 01:01:18,634
This is horse blood?

800
01:01:19,964 --> 01:01:20,964
Yes.

801
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:40,453
Time flew and that cave became
a tomb for plague victims.

802
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:44,023
And one day, a white
snake slid out from there.

803
01:01:45,123 --> 01:01:48,393
Those who saw it called it "imoogi"
and regarded it as ominous.

804
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,663
That's how the story goes.

805
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:54,703
I figured it out.

806
01:01:56,674 --> 01:01:58,344
The thing you truly want.

807
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:01,944
It's being loved by someone.

808
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:04,813
Will you help me get it?

809
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:06,284
And if I decline?

810
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:07,884
I'll kill you.

811
01:02:08,983 --> 01:02:10,284
After I kill Lee Yeon,

812
01:02:11,054 --> 01:02:13,154
I'll kill those you love...

813
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:16,054
and then you.

814
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:20,994
Soon after, a virus will spread.

815
01:02:22,594 --> 01:02:25,764
No one will ever be happy again.

816
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:49,226
<font color="#00ff00">"UNVEILING URBAN LEGENDS"</font>

817
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:40,474
Isn't the air nice and fresh?

818
01:03:42,543 --> 01:03:43,574
Sure.

819
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:46,043
Are you waiting for someone?

820
01:03:46,514 --> 01:03:48,483
- No.
- You know,

821
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,983
I don't think I
ever got my answer.

822
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:54,724
How do you feel about me?

823
01:03:57,424 --> 01:03:59,864
I'm sorry, but my
love's been depleted.

824
01:04:00,694 --> 01:04:03,333
A whole 15 years'
worth of my love...

825
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:05,203
is now Yeon's to keep.

826
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:07,034
What does he mean to you anyway?

827
01:04:11,844 --> 01:04:12,873
Tell me.

828
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:21,784
How dare you lay a hand on
her? I should cut that off.

829
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:23,554
I'm afraid you're
the third wheel.

830
01:04:24,353 --> 01:04:25,683
We're actually on a date.

831
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,253
Let me take you out instead.

832
01:04:29,054 --> 01:04:30,953
I hate those who go
back on their words.

833
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,583
I wish to fly.

834
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:04,494
Got you!

835
01:05:10,964 --> 01:05:12,333
I guess they didn't fly.

836
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,773
Not dry land but water is
the right place for Imoogi.

837
01:05:28,983 --> 01:05:30,154
This is horse blood.

838
01:05:30,154 --> 01:05:32,324
Figuring out your weakness
wasn't cheap, you know.

839
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:45,103
And this is my blood. I
guess our date ends here.

840
01:05:54,273 --> 01:05:58,114
No, Yeon. You've
got it all wrong.

841
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:14,994
What's going on?

842
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:18,163
What went wrong?

843
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:20,134
You went after the wrong one.

844
01:06:21,063 --> 01:06:22,304
What?

845
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:24,074
That Imoogi you're
desperately seeking.

846
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,304
The main piece of it
doesn't lie with me.

847
01:06:28,404 --> 01:06:29,444
Then...

848
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:38,824
I'm burning up.

849
01:06:40,623 --> 01:06:43,594
- What's wrong?
- My body is burning hot.

850
01:06:45,023 --> 01:06:46,094
Does it hurt?

851
01:06:46,364 --> 01:06:47,623
It's so hot.

852
01:06:52,264 --> 01:06:55,703
It's okay. You'll
be fine. Please.

853
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:17,924
Does it not hurt anymore?

854
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:21,764
Look at me.

855
01:07:35,174 --> 01:07:36,443
Long time no see, Yeon.

856
01:07:45,924 --> 01:07:47,253
She's mine.

857
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:51,623
Get out of that body right now!

858
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,720
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

859
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:36,933

860
01:08:37,904 --> 01:08:39,303
