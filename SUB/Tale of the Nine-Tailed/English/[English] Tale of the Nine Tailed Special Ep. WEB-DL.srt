Darn it. What time is it?
Why isn't he here yet?

18
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,989
I'm sorry. Did you wait long?

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,260
Do you want to die?

20
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,230
A wounded cat came to my hospital,
so I was treating its leg.

22
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,470
The cat was a bit chatty,

23
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,099
so I was hearing it out.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,939
Turn on the TV already.

25
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,640
Lee Rang will appear

I almost missed the premiere.

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,580
Tale of the Nine Tailed

Come join us.

33

A 600-year-old legend awakens.

35
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,159
15-minute summary
of the Tale of the Nine Tailed.

36
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,670
Once a fox turns 100,
it can become a beautiful woman,

37
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,209
or it can become a man
to have relations with a woman.

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,709
A fox that lived for 1,000 years
makes a connection with the sky,

39
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,080
becoming a "chunho".

40
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,679
Its extraordinary abilities
equal that of a shaman.

41
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:26,080
They can see things many miles away.

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,450
Nine-tailed foxes
are legendary creatures.

43

<font color="#00ff00">NINE-TAILED FOXES
ARE LEGENDARY CREATURES.</font>

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,190
However, they have adapted
to the human world now.

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,230
- Exactly. I got my hair done today.
- It's all wet.

<font color="#00ff00">WHY DID HE VISIT A WEDDING HALL?</font>

47
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,739
After consuming so many livers
of your foster parents' and men's,

48
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,799
you don't deserve to have
a happy ending.

<font color="#00ff00">HE MUST PUNISH A FOX
FOR HER EVIL DEEDS.</font>

50
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,709
Lee Yeon, a former mountain spirit,
has been using his skills...

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,209
to punish the wicked
who have tainted this world.

52
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:00,390
Have you heard this saying before?

53
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,619
"A fox's misbehavior
eventually catches up to them."

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,830
Of course he went in by himself,

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,589
but why is he walking out alone?

56
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,330
Ji A runs into him by coincidence.

57
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,499
Being a producer, she smells
something fishy about him.

58
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,469
Then one man visits her.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,899
Yeou Gogae.

60
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,899
That's where I saw him.

61
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,410
How can I believe you?

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,239
<font color="#00ff00">SHOULD SHE BELIEVE HIM?</font>

63
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,410
<font color="#00ff00">TO FIND OUT WHO LEE YEON IS,
JI A GOES TO A BUS STOP.</font>

64
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,350

<font color="#00ff00">WILL LEE YEON APPEAR?</font>

66
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,749
Half doubting,
she goes to the address.

67
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,649
It's him.

68
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,160
Ji A sees Lee Yeon again.

69
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,519

70
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,089
Unfortunately, the bus he was on
gets in an accident.

71
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,860
Hey. Can you hear me?

72
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,830
There was only one survivor.

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,100
What did he do?

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,869
<font color="#00ff00">HOW DOES THE ONLY SURVIVOR
REMEMBER THE INCIDENT?</font>

75

76
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,640

was on the opposite side.

82
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,360

- Do you want to die, brother?

86

<font color="#00ff00">21 YEARS AGO, YEOU GOGAE</font>

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,029
21 years ago, Ji A was spending
a happy birthday with her parents.

94
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:57,539
However...

95
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,310
Due to an accident at Yeou Gogae,

96
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,180
she lost both of her parents.

97
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,849
And she experiences...

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,419
something very bizarre after that.

99
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:17,719
<font color="#00ff00">SOMETHING VERY FRIGHTENING
AND BIZARRE HAPPENS.</font>

If you don't...

103
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,469
You mean they are alive?

104

<font color="#00ff00">HER PARENTS ARE ALIVE SOMEWHERE?</font>

105
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,870
I don't know about that.

106
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,039
Ji A wants to use Lee Yeon
to find her missing parents.

107
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:45,349
Meanwhile, the scull of a fisherman
is discovered at a remote island.

108
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,919
The shape of the gold casing...

109
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,950
Could it be Mr. Seo?

110
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,789
Ji A heads to the island...

111
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,000
to find clues about
her parents' disappearance.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,760
And Lee Yeon goes to
the same island...

113
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,930
to find clues about Ah Eum,
who has been reincarnated.

114
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,370
This was where they took this photo.

00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,109
I'm talking about human heads.

118
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,919
It seems like they are trying
to hide something.

119
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,349
- And...
- I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

120
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,120
The sailors act suspiciously.

135
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,870
The scar disappeared.

136
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,680
The islanders begin to die
as if they've been cursed.

00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,599

I mean, this is the perfect place
to die.

155
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,339
You have to die.

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,310
Stop!

157
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,440
Do you know that a bad feeling
is hardly ever wrong?

<font color="#00ff00">HIS BAD FEELING EVENTUALLY
BECOMES TRUE.</font>

159

160
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,310
I will rip you apart.

161
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,849
You can't stop me anyway.

162
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,690
We're surrounded
by evening primroses.

163
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,820
All of this was a plan
to offer Ji A as a sacrifice...

164
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,760
to bring back Imoogi.

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
However, there was something
they didn't know.

171
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:18,400
That something evil was born
on the island that day.

172
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Your obsession will bring
a huge disaster.

176
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,009
Despite the frightening warning,

177
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,940
they find themselves

Lee Yeon received punishment
for killing a human...

180
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
and left Ji A for a while.

181

- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

182

and risks his life
in order to return sooner...

186
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,099
by heading to
The Underworld of Knives.

187
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,339
It's that her death...

188
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,509
will pierce deeper into my flesh...

189
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,109
than these blades cutting me now.

190

00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,040

202
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,359
sitting in this ominous room?

203
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,969
The babysitter turns into a mummy

as if he doesn't know anything.

302
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,680
I promised...

303
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,619
that I would protect you.

304
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,690
After centuries,
they finally met each other again.

305
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,989
And their tragic past
doesn't stop them...

306
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,030
from falling in love again.

309
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,729
I look forward to working with you.

310
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,999
Meanwhile, Imoogi hides his identity
and approaches Ji A.

311
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
What?

312
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,209
And Ji A finds out about the enemy
who's always been nearby.

315
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,879
Did you see her too?

318
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,859
A west capital traitor.

319
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:01,190
You took my parents, didn't you?

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,300
and I'll give you your parents.

323
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,700
We'll catch Imoogi.

330
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,859
more than land.

331
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,830
The Imoogi you're looking for...

332
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,270
I'm not the main one.

335
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,849
Will they be able to turn things
back to normal?

336
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,659
She's mine.

337
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,030
Get out of there!

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,199
Imoogi is really tenacious.

339
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
He still can't let go of his greed
even after 600 years.

340
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,240
Should I go and take care of him?
What do you say?

341
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,570
No, he's unbelievably cruel.

342
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,379
You'll get hurt. It's too dangerous.

343
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:26,839
I'm sure Lee Rang and Lee Yeon...

344
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,649
will do what they can
to destroy Imoogi.

345
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:30,879
After all, they've made up.

346
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,250
They're on good terms these days.

347
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,320
They hated each other for 600 years.

348
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,020
That's because Lee Yeon
was blinded by love...

349
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,990
and ignored his little brother.

350
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,330
- Wait.
- You know that.

351
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,889
- You think he was blinded by love?
- Yes.

352
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,260
Lee Yeon and Ms. Nam are
destined to be together.

353
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,669
Don't talk about
their relationship so lightly.

354
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,139
Do you actually believe in fate?

355
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:56,109
I feel like you and I are also
destined to be together.

356
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,609
I don't think that applies to us.

357
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,949
Let's see which couples
were meant to be together.

358
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,649
Beware.
This could make your heart stop.

359
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,589
Let's take a look
at the love stories in this drama.

360
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,790
The couple who were destined
to meet after 600 years.

361
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,089
Lee Yeon and Ji A.

362
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,399
A fox never lets down the partner
they got together with.

363
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,599
Not until they die.

366
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,040
- I really loved this scene.
- Me too.

367
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,109
I thought they'd lead him to her.

368
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,679
- But nothing happened.
- I guess it's been too long.

GETS BACK HIS POWERS BACK.</font>

370
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,119
Was this the first time
he showed himself...

371
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,750
- as a nine-tailed fox?
- He was so cool here.

372
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,220
- The CG was amazing.
- I know.

373
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,020
I didn't know they'd express
the nine tails that way.

374
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,830
- The CG team is...
- Hey, it's Sin Ju.

375
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,530
- What?
- I was really nervous back then.

376
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,399
It was my first scene with Lee Yeon.

377
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,599
- And Snail Bride?
- Yes.

- "I've been waiting for you."

382
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,619
Isn't she gorgeous?

383
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,159

386
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,869
- Isn't it so sad?
- It's really sad.

387
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:29,070
This scene was really sad.

388
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,899
And as I watched this scene,

389
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,899
I could see how Lee Yeon...

390
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,540
ended up with
such a complicated fate.

391

- Please don't die.
- Isn't this when they realize...

393
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,149
that they both love each other?

394
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,790
Yes, it is.
It's also a very important scene...

395
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,589
because it's when Lee Yeon
realizes that Ms. Nam...

396
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,290
- is Ah Eum.
- Yes, that's right.

397
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,889
- He confirms it.
- Right.

398
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:01,330

- I know.

401
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,369
You got me a mugwort bouquet.

402
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,879
It's just my taste.

Oh, that's it.

It's what he remembers
from 600 years ago.

405
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,250
- It's what Ah Eun did to him.
- I personally love...

406
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,280
how this drama
doesn't miss out on...

407
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,550
even the smallest details.

408
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:26,790
Before we found out that Ji A
was actually Ah Eum,

409
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,429
Ji A was shown...

410
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,159
as fearless and outspoken.

411
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,760
She was very brave.

412
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,929
But after Ah Eum overlaps with her,

413
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:37,970
she also showed how feminine
she could be, and that was nice.

414
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,339
Yes, she really does have
a lot of sides to her.

415
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,470
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

416
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,240
She looked beautiful here
at the folk village.

417
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,310
From what I know,
this was the first kissing scene...

418
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,780
between Ji A and Lee Yeon.

419
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,119
- This scene?
- Yes.

420
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,290
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,439
- Nice. I look handsome.
- Okay.

428
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,070
Did you hear that?

429

"Nice. I look handsome."

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,179
"Nice. Look at my broad shoulders."

431

It's the first time Ah Eum saves
the nine-tailed fox...

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,780
as a human being.

433
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,619
Do you remember what Lee Yeon said?

434
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,919
He doubted she could help him
since she was only human.

435
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,790
Action.

436
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,260

Okay.

439
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,869
I have good eyesight,
so I'll watch from here.

440
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,899
I'll be honest. I can't see a thing.

441
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,210
As you watch them shoot,

442
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,310
you can see
that they look great together.

443
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,080
- They look really close.
- They do.

444
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,750
That melts into the scenes.

445
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,820
Otherwise, all those scenes
wouldn't come out so great.

446
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,149
This is weird too.

447
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,760
It feels like you don't even care.

448
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,790
It's all dry now.

Let's try that again.

454
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,379
I was scared.
People might chase after me.

455
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,379
Okay.

his shoulder get drenched.

458
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,290
Talk about a cliche, right?

459
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,490
He's saying that
he'll always wait for her.

460
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,790
- Thanks, Yeon.
- And that he'll protect her.

461
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,389
His love couldn't be more innocent.

462
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,859
I'll stay here.

- Think of the things you like.
- Gosh.

469
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,849
Like mint chocolate ice cream?

470
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,449
I...

471
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:06,419
Didn't this seem like
a scene from a fairy tale?

472
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,480
Yes.

473
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,790
They fall asleep while making
a list of what they like.

474
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,790
One sheep, two sheep...

475
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,460
Before I go to bed,
I keep picturing...

476
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,359
your face as well.

477
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,530
Did you cook?

478
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,270
As you can see,

479
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,540
Lee Yeon will do practically
anything for her.

480
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,599
And like this,

481
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,369
I'll check to see if she's alive.

482
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:32,580
Hey, she's breathing.

483
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,080
- Also...
- You know,

484
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,149
Dong Wook teases others and
plays pranks every chance he gets.

485
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,179
I know.

486
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,550
He loves to have fun.

487
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,449
Anyway, you said that you like...

488
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,490
the smell of freshly cooked rice.

489
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:47,760
That started with an "anyway".

490
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,060
We'll go again.

493
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,429
It's boisterous.

What kind of people

497
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,439
It's a stress-reliever.

498
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,210
They must be opposites
when it comes to horror movies.

499
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,280
We're complete opposites.

500
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,949
That's a pretty scene.

501
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:14,720
- Right?
- Their size difference...

When do you find Lee Yeon's gaze
to be most romantic?

507
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,030
I'm on Lee Rang's side,

508
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,270
so I've never thought
of Lee Yeon to be nice.

509
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,040
But if I have to choose a moment...

510
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,510
Don't. I'm the only one
you should see.

511
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,780
Your eyes should be for Sin Ju.

512
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,740
I've known Lee Yeon for 600 years...

513
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,480
which is why I know
his coolest gaze.

514
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,720
He sometimes gazes down
with his chin tilted upwards.

515
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,689
You'll see that his red lips
are slightly parted.

516
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,260
Could you try it on camera?

You can't kill me.

536

It's true.

No!

538
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,129
Lee Yeon should've seen this.

539
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,830
Him kissing the back of her hand.

540
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,800
He wouldn't have let it slide.

My favorite scene is the one

Me too!

547
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,960
- With the red umbrella?
- Yes.

548
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,030
He lifts up the umbrella
to see her in front of her.

549
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,199
He's about to approach her
when she tells him not to.

550
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,300
- She goes to him instead.
- I'll come to you.

"I've been waiting for you too."

552
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,139
This is the expression
that Lee Yeon held.

553
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:13,899
And don't forget the rain.

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,939
Lee Yeon and Lee Rang show
an unorthodox brotherly love.

557
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,780
Nice.

558
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,449
It's Lee Yeon and Lee Rang.

You're acting

This conversation doesn't
seem important, but it is.

"You're acting
like you lack affection."

565
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,290
Just because of a girl,

566
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,629
you gave up on being a spirit and
turned your back on the mountain.

00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,000
Yes.

Their action scenes
were my favorite.

I love when they duel...

574

and when they fight

576
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,290
- Baby fox, Lee Rang.
- You were alive?

577
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,250
I didn't hear from you since

In my opinion, this is the scene...

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,730
that's most important
in the brothers' saga.

584
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,000
- Yes, I agree.
- Lee Rang was a sinner...

585
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,839
who had to be punished
by a mountain spirit...

586
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:27,379
that was Lee Yeon.

587
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,649
But he was also a big brother
who cared for his sibling.

588
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,849
He's someone he wished to protect.

589
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,520
He must've been torn
between those two roles.

590
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,760
The rift between them
that lasted 600 years...

591
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,859
was caused by this event.

592
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,859

<font color="#00ff00">MY BROTHER'S THE BEST!</font>

606
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,859
<font color="#00ff00">RANG IS TRAPPED
IN THE FOREST OF STARVING GHOSTS.</font>

607
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,629
- The Forest of Starving Ghosts.
- The Forest of Starving Ghosts.

608
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:20,830
Hey, kid!

609
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,369
Gosh, this moment.

610
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,970
The first full moon of
the lunar new year. Jwibulnori.

611
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,599
Wasn't this scene incredible?

612
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,909
- They worked really hard.
- With their backs to each other's.

613
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,609
And you wet the bed that night.

614
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
For three years after that,

615
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,909
- Be quiet.
- I called you a bed wetter!

616
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,280
"Be quiet."

617
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,020
- Action!
- They sure had it rough.

618
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,649
I heard that it took
three weeks to film...

619
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,649
all the scenes needed in the woods.

620
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,720
<font color="#00ff00">THEY SPENT 3 WEEKS
FILMING IN THE WOODS.</font>

621
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,260
It must've been difficult
due to the summer heat.

622
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,260
Yeon and Rang.

623
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,030
It was possible
because it was those two.

624
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,500
<font color="#00ff00">RANG WAS INJURED AFTER
THE ATTACK OF THE STARVING GHOSTS.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">HE ANNOUNCES THAT HE'S GIVING UP!</font>

626
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,939
I'm tired of dragging this leg along
with me.

627
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:03,770
- So?
- Go to your woman.

628
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,710
- This scene...
- It's a great one.

629
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,480
Personally, it's my favorite scene.

630
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,480
You still give up easily...

631
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,649
- and whine like a baby.
- My favorite.

632
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,379
How could life and death be
so simple to you?

633
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,419
I shouldn't have come.

634
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,419
That's the expression of his
that I love.

635
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,020
- I see.
- Right?

636
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,089
Didn't I mimic it perfectly?

637
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,960
<font color="#00ff00">ONCE AGAIN,
THEY LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.</font>

AND THE VIEWERS TO TEARS.</font>

639
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,300
"I have never missed a target."

640
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,570
Think carefully about
how you survived...

641
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,369
with that stupid head of yours.

642
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,199
- Will you keep it down?
- Gosh.

643
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,540
<font color="#00ff00">WHAT DOES RANG THINK
IS THE BROTHERS' BEST SCENE?</font>

644
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,869
Every scene to me
seemed like the best...

645
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,310
which is why I'm finding it hard
to choose just one.

646
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,550
But the scene in
the Forest of Starving Ghosts...

647
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,609
where Lee Yeon...

648
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,780
told Rang the ultimate truth...

649
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,720
is most memorable to me.

650
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,060
"I have never missed a target."

651
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,790
The emotions I felt when I heard...

652
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,790
that he had never missed a target...

653
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,760
and the way we interacted...

654
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:03,199
make that particular scene
my favorite.

655
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,000
You see, foxes...

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,839
They can change form!

657
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,909
- We can change forms.
- "We can change forms."

658
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,580
Leave my brother alone...

659
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,710
or I might just actually kill you.

660
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:22,119
Lee Yeon and Lee Rang
look great together, don't they?

661
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:25,589
Yes, they look like actual brothers.

662
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,260
Even though they're
arguing once again,

663
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,359
they look good together.

664
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,800
That's how they are
in real life too.

665
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Exactly.

666
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,470
This is so cool,

667
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,230
but what about me? What about us?

668
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,540
- Let's take a look!
- Here we go.

669
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,540
The sweet but scary,

670
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,679
Sin Ju and Yu Ri.

671
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:48,409
If a fox has money and power,
it's one or the other.

<font color="#00ff00">THEIR THRILLING FIRST ENCOUNTER

674
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,189
I must be a fox who
falls in love at first sight.

675
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,889
I remember falling for you
at the Korean restaurant that day...

676
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,230
while eating my lunch.

677
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,859
- I like those who are handsome.
- Really?

678
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,760
That must be why you like me.

679
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,970
- I guess.
- Thanks for saying so.

680
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,599
You owe me now.

681
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,099
<font color="#00ff00">LOVE IS IN THE AIR.</font>

682
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,609
Shall we introduce each other
since we're the same species?

683
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,810
Why are you laughing?

684
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,879
I can't help it
when I think of this moment.

685
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:22,849
This was before
we got to know each other.

686
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:25,149
Exactly. We were
practically strangers.

687
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,220
I'm sweet like this.

688
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,849
We had to smooch
on the first day we met.

689
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,919
Right, we smooched.

690
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,020
- Here?
- Yes, you smooched me.

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,169
We met for the first time
at the vet.

694
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,770
What we love so much...

695
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:49,210
is this background music
whenever we appear.

696
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,639
I agree.

699
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,310
So this was when you first gazed
at me so melancholically.

700
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,520
Many comments were
about your melancholic gaze.

701
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,619
Here's the gaze.

702

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,760
This was when we met...

705
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:14,330
- for the second time.
- A dog thief?

706
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,129
I realize that not only are you
beautiful on the outside...

707
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,300
but also on the inside.

708
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,010
This was when...

709
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:27,909
I also realized that you were...

710
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,780
a nice fox.

711
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:32,080
- What are you doing here?
- I have something to discuss.

712
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,250
I was shocked because I thought
Anastasia had died.

713
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,389
- Were you?
- Yes.

714
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:40,119
Check out that sweet music.

715
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,230
- Do you hear it?
- I do.

716
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,560
I'll look forward to it.

717
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,599
This was my first time
smooching you,

718
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,129
and I was so nervous.

719
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,439
What? I'm going to kill you!

720
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,470
See you later.

721
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,540
We rarely made bloopers,

722
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,379
don't you think?

723
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,710
We did shoot the same scenes
over and over again.

724
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,250
- Weren't those bloopers?
- Not at all.

725
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,720
Then what's a blooper?
When the director says, "Cut"?

726
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,849
NG!

727
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,550
That rarely happened.

728
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,089
See? I'm right.

729
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,990
- Yes.
- We were the best partners.

730
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,530
Let's continue.

731
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,659
What brings you here, Yu Ri?

732
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,400
Tell us the truth now.
Why were you craving a drink?

733
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,299
Me? I was thirsty.

734
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,239
Okay.

735
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,299
What? Where is this zoo?

736
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,340
<font color="#00ff00">SIN JU BECOMES ENRAGED

737

How could he beat you up?

738
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,139
You're so manly.

739
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,279
- What? I'm sorry.
- Do you want to sleep with me?

740
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,819
- What?
- Sleep with me.

741
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:41,719
There are different stages
to say "I like you".

742
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,849
It's the same music again.

743

<font color="#00ff00">ARE THESE TWO FOXES FLIRTING?</font>

You could ask me to date you.

745
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:50,489
Perhaps we can say that today
will be our first day as a couple.

746
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,500
Let's skip what's unnecessary.

747
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,369
That was an amazing line.

748
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,170
This must be behind the scenes.

749
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,139
Am I too dark-skinned to be seen?

750
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,139
I can only see my yellow shirt.

751
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,040
I can see your teeth, though.

752
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,610
You're so harsh. You are!

753
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,520
We weren't that close back then.

754
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,549
Yes, we were.

755
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,690
You could ask me to date you.

760
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,299
- It was funny.
- Why didn't they?

761
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,980
<font color="#00ff00">THIS COUPLE MAKES US SMILE.</font>

762
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,440
They're all embarrassed.

763
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:45,349
You're good at cooking too.

764
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:46,880
I thought you'd be homesick.

765
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,150
I'm good at it.

766
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,020
I know this smell.

767
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,219
- In real life?
- Yes.

768
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm good at cooking ramyeon.

769
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,360
I mean...

770
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,799
<font color="#00ff00">IS SIN JU PROPOSING TO HER?</font>

771
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,259
I'm furious again.

772
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,770
You always get mad.

773
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,770
To be honest,

774
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,000
you diss me a lot.

775
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,170
- When?
- In that scene as well.

776
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,040
You say that I have
no family or friends.

777
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,110
You call me a necklace thief.

778
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,779
This is my first time
in a relationship.

779
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,520
Do you think
our love will come true?

780
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:24,389
I'm not sure.
I really want that to happen,

781
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,889
but it's really not up to me.

782
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:29,730
It depends on how you go about this.

783
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,989
She always plays so hard to get.

784
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,560
But then again, this is her charm.

785
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:37,199
Our drama isn't only filled
with lovey-dovey scenes.

786
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,770
- There are...
- What else is there?

787
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:41,770
- many scary scenes as well.
- I'm really terrified.

788
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,369
- There are various goblins.
- Native ones?

789
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,440
Yes.

790
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,480
- I'm so terrified.
- Me too.

791
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,949
- I can't watch those scenes alone.
- Me neither.

792
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,080
Can you watch them with me?

793
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:52,719
Let's watch them separately.

794
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,319
<font color="#00ff00">A BRIDE IN A SNOW-WHITE DRESS</font>

795
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:56,619
She's the first goblin to appear.

796
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,219
- Gosh.
- Gosh, that scene.

797
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,759
I'm really scared.

798
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:05,960
Those young ghosts terrified me.
Seriously.

799
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,230
What's the name of that goblin...

800
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,460
- that ate coins?
- Bulgasalyi.

801
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,500
Bulgasalyi.

802
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,830
Starving ghosts.

803
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,170
- Grandpa Jangseung.
- Grandpa Jangseung.

804
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,909
Ouduksini.

805
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,869
Don't be bewitched.

806
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,540
List of native goblins on the drama.

807
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,779
Which goblin scares you the most?

808
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,009
The young ghosts.

809
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,420
- I...
- The one that goes...

810
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,580
- like this?
- Don't mimic them.

811
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,420
Stop it.

812
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,319
Don't.

813
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,520
Stop.

I am. Just a minute.

820
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,170
What scared me the most...

821
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,080
was that he was on Ji A's back.

822
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,909
He's extremely heavy.

823
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:58,480
He slowly choked her
and weighed her down.

824
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,150
He was a kind ghost.

825
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,619
- He saved her life.
- He did.

826
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,349
In exchange for some makgeolli.

00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,270
You should cut down on drinking.

833
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,299
How cute.

834
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,799
- She doesn't seem to be acting.
- Right.

835
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,170
She's exhausted.

- Who?

840
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,250
I only saw you.

841
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,719

about our native goblins.

845
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,259
I think it's one of the factors
that makes our drama great.

How do I put it? It was bizarre.

You're both so beautiful,

but this scene is too scary.

I was terrified here
when they showed...

00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,449

This scene.

Those innocent children were smiling
while doing that.

You should never set foot in there

This is the song.

913
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,639
<font color="#00ff00">GATEKEEPER, OPEN THE GATE

<font color="#00ff00">LISTEN TO THE LYRICS CAREFULLY.</font>

915
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:50,279
Right.

916
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,679
One side doesn't have the key...

917
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,020
while the other side
can't find the door.

918
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,319
Jae Hwan explains...
What are you doing?

919
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:57,119
What are you... Don't!

920
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,549
- Sin Ju.
- What?

921
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,920
What is your biggest fear?

922
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
- Mine?
- Let's see.

<font color="#00ff00">WHAT IS HE THE MOST AFRAID OF?</font>

924
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,299
- Could it be pistols?
- Pistols?

925
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:09,599
<font color="#00ff00">HE WAS COMPLETELY SUBDUED

- Stop that. I'm scared.

928
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,409
Excuse me.

935
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,360
She was the most-searched word

936
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Do you remember?

937
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:38,759
<font color="#00ff00">SHE MADE A HUGE IMPACT
WITH HER CHARISMA.</font>

938
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:39,960

00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,210
You're a nine-tailed fox
who loved a human.

942
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,170
You'll end up...

943
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,340
making that woman die
with your hands.

944

<font color="#00ff00">SHE CURSES HIM

Hey, lady. You should worry about
your own destiny.

946
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,060
Do you know how much I waited
to see this?

947
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:13,830
I bet all the viewers were tricked
by Lee Yeon.

948
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,659
You probably thought...

949
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,069
Come here!

950

the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

952
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,099
That was his plan to lure her.

953
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,810
He was just pretending to be lost.

954
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,980
The more goblins there are,
the more Lee Yeon suffers.

955
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,250
I really hate that!

This is so scary.

959
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,989
- It's Imoogi.
- His acting is awesome.

960
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,000
He's so scary.
He eats human beings.

961
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,929
And the door opens right here...

962
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:52,029
Gosh, it's the first time
Imoogi shows itself as an adult.

963
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,440
It had a strong impact.

964
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,670
It was I who should've been...

965
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,940
<font color="#00ff00">FOCUSED</font>

966
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:01,139

- I'll become a mountain spirit...

968
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,049
and take her as my bride.

969
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,790
Gosh, Imoogi's greed is endless.

970
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,989
He and his ambition.

973
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,060
Disappear. Get lost!

974
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,869
Look closely.

980
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,810
Imoogi isn't frightening...

981
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,779
because he's a ghost or something.

982
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,619
It feels like he could be
really around us somewhere.

983
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,520
He feels like an actual criminal
who could be around us.

984
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,889
- Really?
- Yes, to me.

985
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,759
You're right. He's so hard to read.

986
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,900
Most goblins usually say
they're goblins...

987
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,259
and make it obvious.

988
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,400
But Imoogi is different.

989
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,599
<font color="#00ff00">SMILING</font>

992

But it would be so hard
for Lee Yeon...

993
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:10,179
if he kills all the goblins
on his own.

994
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,179
So there are people who help him.

995
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,779
- Ji A.
- There's Ji A.

996
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,349
- And Lee Rang.
- There's Lee Rang.

997
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:18,090
- There's also Hyuneuiong.
- Oh, the deities!

998
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,259
- The deities.
- That's right.

999
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,790
We have some reliable deities
on our side.

1000
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,989
- Shall we see them?
- It's time to meet them.

1001
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,060
Let's see them now.

1002

Let's meet the deities that protect

- Taleuipa and Hyuneuiong.

1006
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,969
Lee Yeon must never hear of this.

1007
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,540
Taleuipa is so scary.

1008
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,340
She's very powerful too.

1009
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,440
She's suppressing her power.

1010
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,009
- She can do anything.
- I don't even want to...

1011
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,980
go near the
Afterlife Immigration Office.

1012
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,389
Because I've committed so many sins.

1013
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,389
I'll be thrown into The Underworld
no matter what.

1014
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,460
I never want to go near there.

is really good at their job.

1058
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,469
The Snail Bride made that food.
What are you talking about?

1059
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:52,679
What I liked most...

1060
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:55,739
were the drumsticks I ate
with Sin Ju.

1061
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,179
Oh, the chicken soup?

1062
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:58,310
<font color="#00ff00">I WILL TAKE CARE OF

Oh, no!

1068
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,699
What did he whisper into her ear?

1069
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:14,830
I'm so curious.

1070
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,599
<font color="#00ff00">WHO IS THE NEXT DEITY

FIGHTING?</font>

1073
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,880
It's Lee Kyu Hyong.

1074
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,110
Hi, Kyu Hyong.

1075
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,380
<font color="#00ff00">THEY FOUGHT LIKE CRAZY,</font>

1076
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,349
<font color="#00ff00">BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY
BEST FRIENDS?</font>

1077
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,690
This was a surprising twist.

1078
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,790
I thought he was a rival
with the district magistrate...

1079
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:44,560
or an enemy,

1080
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,259
- but they were old friends.
- Right.

1081
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,299
He's one of the four
mountain spirits.

1082
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,969
He looks great.

1083
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,969
<font color="#00ff00">HIS REAL IDENTITY IS
A NATIVE BLACK BEAR.</font>

1084
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,199
A native black bear.

1085
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,099
He said there would be an accident
on the third day of the month.

1086
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,710
<font color="#00ff00">HE GIVES HIS BEST FRIEND

1087

A human being.

1088
00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:01,909
- In that outfit?
- He's drinking...

1089
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,610
- an Americano in that outfit.
- It's so funny.

1090
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,849
The drink doesn't suit the outfit.

1091
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:07,520
You're the best.

1092
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:08,580
Suddenly?

1093
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,549
Thank you for coming to
my birthday party.

1094
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,290
We asked him so abruptly,

1095
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,830
but he happily agreed
to appear on our drama,

1096
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,130
so I feel so thankful to Gyu Hyong.

1097
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,099
- He's really a good friend.
- Yes.

1098
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:23,830
I'm going to leave now.

1099
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,830
But you have to stay
until the evening.

1100
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,400
He always calls me and leaves first.

1101
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,639
- I have to shoot a night scene too.
- Sorry.

1102
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:31,540
Say something to the viewers.

1103
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,139
I hope all of you enjoy
Tale of the Nine Tailed.

1104
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:37,179
Let's do this.

1105

<font color="#00ff00">PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO...</font>

1107
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,219
Do you know there's something
more amazing than the deities?

1108
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,520
- What? Really?
- Something more amazing.

1109
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,119
Is it something I don't know about?

1110
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,360
Didn't you hear this term?

1111
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,389
If actors change completely
after they get paid,

1112
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,960
what about our drama?

1113
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:55,560
It changes completely
after computer graphics?

1114
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,799
That's correct. Let's see it.

1115
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,139
Let's go behind the scenes to see
how a drama is made.

1116
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,369
This is how Tale of the Nine Tailed
is made.

00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:06,880
<font color="#00ff00">A TOTALLY NEW SHOOTING METHOD

1118
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:10,080
Tale of the Nine Tailed is famous
for it's computer graphics.

1119
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,179
The computer graphics that are used
for each episode...

1120
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:16,150
is capturing the eyes
of our viewers.

1121
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:19,049
Do you want to know
how these scenes are made?

1122
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:21,060
Shall we go to the set first?

<font color="#00ff00">LEE YEON IS PREPARING TO SHOOT

1126
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:27,029
Like this.

1127
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:29,400
Why does he look so excited?

1128
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,040
Gosh, it's been so long since
I did this, and it feels awkward.

1129
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,469
Don't look at me.

1130
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,540
What do you mean?
We can't take our eyes off you.

1131
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,810
Wasn't he being shy
just a second ago?

1132
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,580
He's suddenly immersed in his role.

1133
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,409
Do you want to know
what scene it is?

1134
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,980
It's this scene.

1135
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,920
The scene where Lee Yeon gets angry
and turns into a nine-tailed fox.

1136
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,389
Before computer graphics,
after computer graphics.

1137
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,159
It looks more amazing like this.

1138
00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:00,529
This is how this awesome scene
was created.

1139
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,830
Now, it's time to see Lee Yeon
being punished...

1140
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,099
which hurt the viewers' hearts
as well as mine.

1141
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,110
Wait, what is he doing?

1142
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,840
Oh, he's getting bulked up...

1143
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,139
in order to show his upper body.

1146
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,049
Gosh, I feel sad already.

1147
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,389
If you add computer graphics
to this scene...

1148
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,190
<font color="#00ff00">THE SNOWY PRISON COMES ALIVE

1149
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,759
Just looking at this scene
makes my hands feel cold.

1150
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,929
This is the horrible Snowy Prison.

1151
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:40,139
Lee Yeon suffered so much.

1152
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,069
It's a truly amazing scene.

1153
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,210
But Lee Yeon's suffering
hasn't ended yet.

1154
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,409
I wonder if he knows
how much I'm worried about him.

1155
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,020
I need to signal to Granny
on the next scene?

1156
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,080
- Yes.
- Okay.

1157
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,949
Shall we use a signal
or something else?

1158
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,290
- I'll just tell her.
- Tell her?

1159
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,290
"See you." Like this.

1160
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,219
Lee Yeon looks so excited.

00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:11,670
Action!

1164
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,239
He wipes off his smile
and starts to act seriously.

<font color="#00ff00">THE UNDERWORLD OF KNIVES</font>

00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,159
<font color="#00ff00">IT MEANS A MOUNTAIN

It's a deadly place where knives
fly at you from here and there.

1170
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,630
Why did he volunteer to go there?

1171
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,170
He has such a long way to go.

1172
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:49,340
Lee Yeon, are you okay?

1173
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,080
This place looks nice and cozy,

1174
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,480
but with computer graphics,

1175
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,310
it turns into
the Underworld of Knives.

1176
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:00,179
I will never go
to that frightening place.

1177
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,159
The moment he steps foot,
knives fly toward him.

1178
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,259
Every step of the way...

1179
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,860
needs to be taken very carefully.

just by watching it again.

1185
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,369
Knives keep flying toward him,

1186
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,840
and Lee Yeon gets covered in wounds.

1187
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:59,069
Can't it stop?

1188
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,810
He already got injured a lot.

1189
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,049
I just can't seem to watch it.

1190
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,119
What am I supposed to do
if she's just there?

1193
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,489
It's where Lee Yeon saves Ms. Nam...

00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,310
Great job.

1199
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,279
This scene starts off with
Ms. Nam falling from the rooftop,

1200
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:42,080
and then Lee Yeon saves her.

1201
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,219
And finally,

1202
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:49,159
the added visual effect shows
that Ms. Nam has the fox marble,

1203
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,460
and that resulted in
creating such an amazing scene.

1204
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,429
This scene was not only great
in visual effects,

1205
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,170
but it was also

VISUAL EFFECTS AND ENDING.</font>

1207
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:15,980
And at last,
the viewers and Lee Yeon...

1208
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,920
were shocked to find out
that Ms. Nam was...

1209
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:22,420
the reincarnated version of Ah Eum.

1210
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:29,299
I found you.

1211
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,900
Be born again.

1212
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,639
I'll make sure to find you.

1213
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,239
Lee Yeon's 600-year-old love...

1214
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:45,779
was portrayed even more beautifully
thanks to the visual effects.

00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,130
- Where should we go?
- Let's take a look...

1220
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,799
- at the filming location.

1223
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,739
Oh, this place? This is
the Afterlife Immigration Office.

1224
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,549
- Yes, that's right.
- Do you know where that is?

1225
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:19,210
It's where... You know...

1230
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,610
Because we're still alive.

1231
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,069
That's right.
I don't want to go inside.

1232

But aren't you...

1233
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:49,310

Gosh, it's scary here.

1240
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:01,920

- There's someone...

1241
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,759
- who shouldn't be here.
- What?

1242
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:05,389
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh, no.

1243
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:08,429
You might not be able to see him

00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,869
I'm against their marriage.

1251
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,250
Why are you here?

1252
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:25,009
Am I not allowed to be here?

1253
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,020
- Of course.
- Why?

1254
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,719
You shouldn't be here.
I'm trying so hard...

1255

to keep you alive.
You can't be here.

1256
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,090
This is the last day
we'll be shooting here,

1257
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,860
so I was actually taking photos.

1258
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,590
But you guys barged in.

1259
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,159
Lee Rang, why are you here?

1260
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,670
I'm... The reason I'm here...

1261
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,400
You'll find out why I'm here
if you watch...

1262
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,069
what happens after episode 12.

1263
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,279
- It's hard to fool him.
- Rang, why don't you...

1264
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:56,080
say a word to the viewers?

1265

Thank you so much...

1266
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,650

1267

You look really scary.

1268
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:04,020
Oh, really? I'll go down there.

1269
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,190
It's because you're
watching from above.

1270
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,360

Thank you.

1278
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,310
Bye. They'll probably just use
10 seconds of this.

1279
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,650
Oh, thank you.

1280
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,210
I guess that's all
they're going to use.

1281
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,349
I must've talked too much.

1282
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,949
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1283

- Good luck until the end.
- Thanks.

Everyone, let me show you something.

1285
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:43,630
- The doors to the Underworld.
- Is this the entrance?

1286
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,989
- Yes.
- This is where Yeon went, right?

1287
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:47,599
Yeon was sent to the Snowy Prison.

1288
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,230
- Yes.
- From there,

1289
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,770
he went to the Underworld of Knives.

1290
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,170
- Yes.
- Let's open it. 1, 2, 3.

1291
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,170
What's this?

1292
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:55,469
It's freezing!

1293
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,340
Sin Ju, it's freezing.

1294
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,710
- They're still shooting.
- Oh, really?

1295
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,409
- Can you take off your coat?
- They're still shooting.

1296
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,580
Take off your coat for me.
It's freezing.

1297
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,880
It's freezing?

1298

She's so weird.

1299
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:11,889
My gosh.

1300
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,360
It's because she's still young.

1301
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,989
Do you see the green walls?

1302
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,759
What do you call them? Green...

1303
00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:18,060
- Green screen.
- Green back?

1304
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,830
- It's called a green screen.
- Yes.

1305
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:21,860
It's all for visual effects.

1306
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,770
- Look at the background.
- Do you see all that?

1307
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,170
It looks really tall, right?

1308
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,400
- After this...
- But actually, it's not.

1309
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,770
We're just acting.
Let's try looking up.

1310
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:33,739
1, 2, 3. Shoot.

1313

- Something's falling!
- Oh, gosh.

1314
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:41,279
Yes, there you go.

1315
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:43,489

- What is that?

1316
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:45,250
that you guys have
all been dying to see.

1317
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,489
- This is really heavy.
- Let me see.

1318
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,920
- It really is heavy.
- Right?

1319
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,259
I think it weighs about 4kg.

- Guiyomi. No, that's not it.

01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:08,210
- Isn't it "Temptation of Wolves"?
- It's Guiyeoni.

I stole this from him.

- Grapes.
- Watermelon.

talk about this beforehand.

No, it's past, not path.

did you used to ride a horse?

1357
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:09,869
A horse?

1358
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,610
- Yes, I did.
- I see you riding a horse.

1359
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,739
And you're half undressed.

1360
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,380
Is that how you rode your horse?

1361
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,909
- Yes, you're right.
- You have long hair and a mustache.

1362
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:18,980
Yes, that's right.

1363
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:21,380
I see you chasing after
Song Joong Ki.

1364
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,119
You're from "Arthdal Chronicles"!

1365
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,750
- What was your name again?
- Mu Kwang.

1366
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:29,090
- Yes, Mu Kwang!
- I used to be Mu Kwang.

1367
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:30,659
Let's go to the next
filming location.

1368
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,860
- Off we go.
- We're at Imoogi's house.

1369
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,960
This is the place.

1370
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,230
He must be moving...

1371
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,429
- to a nicer place.
- The moving company came...

1372
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,699
and helped clean the place out.

1373
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:41,199
This place sure is luxurious.

1374
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,710
- How flashy.
- It was grander during filming.

1375
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,139
Should we begin
our married life here?

1376
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,080
Here? I guess it's not bad.

1377
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:52,080
Where are the rooms though?
Let me see them first.

1378
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,949
Even though you haven't
been around for that long,

1379
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,549
you seem to be quite materialistic.

1380
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,290
That's just the way I was born.

1381
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,020
Is that so? Then let's
check out the second floor.

1382
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,029
<font color="#00ff00">HOW DARE YOU PROVOKE
A RUSSIAN FOX!</font>

1383
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,060
What?

1384
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,230
<font color="#00ff00">WHIMPERING</font>

1385
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,170
She always intimidates me.

1386
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,369
May we come in, Imoogi?

1387
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,739
<font color="#00ff00">THIS IS WHERE IMOOGI STAYED.</font>

1388
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,509
- Gosh, I'm scared.
- Look at these talismans.

1389
01:02:18,509 --> 01:02:20,040
See?

1390
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,179
There are a lot.

1391
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:23,880
This is the hallway
where the lady was dragged.

1392
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,279
- Really?
- Remember the fingernails?

1393
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,119
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

1394
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,319
- On the other side.
- Stand behind the door.

1395
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,889
- I'll play Imoogi.
- Sure.

1396
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:35,560
<font color="#00ff00">SIN JU AS IMOOGI,
YU RI AS HIS POSSIBLE VICTIM</font>

1397
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,330
I ate her. I ate the person.

1398
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,929
<font color="#00ff00">YU RI DOES HER BEST IN THE SCENE.</font>

1399
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:44,299
<font color="#00ff00">WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?</font>

1400
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:47,139
Yu Ri!

1401
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,469
<font color="#00ff00">YU RI!</font>

1402
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,009
I can't help it
being Sin Ju and all.

1403
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,310
Tale of the Nine Tailed,
A 600 Year Legend.

1404
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:57,210
It's now time to wrap this up.

1405
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,980
Sin Ju, what was it like
to join me for this special episode?

1406
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:02,779
I had a blast
hosting the show with you,

1407
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,549
but I loved it even more
since it means I was joined...

1408
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,920
by the viewers of
Tale of the Nine Tailed.

1409
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,090
I guess it's the same for me.
I'm glad to have had...

1410
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,330
this opportunity
to spend time with the fans.

1411
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:17,630
It was also great
to go over the points of the show...

1412
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,830
with you.

1413
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,139
There are now four episodes
to go in the series.

1414
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:24,310
Look forward to what happens
between Sin Ju and Yu Ri...

1415
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,540
and please tune in.

1416
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,909
There's nothing else
I can say to you.

1417
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:29,909
Thank you for watching...

1418
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,310
and please look forward...

1419
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,980
to how the story will end.

1420
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,779
Tale of the Nine Tailed,
A 600 Year Legend.

1421
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:38,250
Our fate that travels back
to 600 years from now.

1422
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,690
I wonder how we'll all end up.

1423
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,590
Will all the couples
have their happy endings?

1424
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,699
We hope for your ongoing
love and support.

1425
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:50,230
So this is where we say goodbye.

1426
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,730
I'm Hwang Hee who plays Gu Sin Ju.

1427
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,940
And I'm Kim Yong Ji
who plays Ki Yu Ri.

1428
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,210
Bye!

Did you test me?

Take me and save Lee Rang.

I'm about to end
this never-ending fight.

This dagger pierces one's sins.
It'll pierce the Imoogi's soul.

1442
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,670
You must get out
of this fight alive.

1443
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,480
- No.
- Move.

1444
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,279
You altered the register?

1445

No one can take Ji A.
