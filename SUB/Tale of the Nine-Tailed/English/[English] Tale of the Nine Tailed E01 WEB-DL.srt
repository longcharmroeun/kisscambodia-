1
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,873
When a fox turns 100,

2
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:19,012
it can transform into
a beautiful woman...

3
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:22,542
or become a man who
has relations with one.

4
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:26,053
However, a fox of 1,000 years
receives the sky's blessing...

5
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,422
and becomes a celestial fox.

6
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:31,053
Its abilities match that
of a powerful shaman...

7
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,293
which allows it to see
what are miles ahead.

8
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,062
I was going to wait
until we get home,

9
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,602
but here's your
birthday present.

10
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,913
Do you like your gift?

11
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:01,882
Yes, I love it.

12
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:14,803
<font color="#00ff00">1999, YEOU GOGAE</font>

13
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:42,953
Ji A.

14
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,703
Help.

15
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,103
Help.

16
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,503
My princess, you're up.

17
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:36,703
Thank goodness. It was a dream.

18
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,742
President Kim Dae Jung...

19
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:41,212
- Here you go.
- Here's our fruit.

20
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,582
Mom, I love you. I
love you so much.

21
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:47,823
What's gotten into you?

22
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:50,522
Dad, I love you. I
love you so much.

23
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,163
My goodness. I also love
you very much, Ji A.

24
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:57,122
Did you have a bad dream?

25
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:58,693
I don't even want
to think about it.

26
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,862
- My goodness.
- They will be sticking to the plan.

27
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:28,892
Many people got injured due
to the fire that broke out...

28
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:31,493
at Seongjin Market this evening.

29
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,063
The fire broke out at 7pm...

30
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:36,763
and got extinguished after having
burned down three buildings.

31
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:40,232
The fire caused severe
damage to the market,

32
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:43,602
and a total of 22 people
ended up getting injured.

33
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,513
The fire broke out in a
cramped space in the market...

34
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,183
and spread throughout...

35
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:54,222
Mom, I'm hungry.

36
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,222
- Do you want some fruit?
- No.

37
00:04:57,753 --> 00:05:00,722
I want walnut cookies.

38
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,232
Let's see. Where did I
put the walnut cookies?

39
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,003
I think we ate them all.

40
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,142
Can I get them for you tomorrow?

41
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:21,042
We never buy walnut cookies.

42
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:24,982
I had to go to the hospital
because it turned out...

43
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:26,313
I was allergic to nuts.

44
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,352
Oh, right. I forgot.

45
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:32,553
My mom never forgets that
because she's a doctor.

46
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:37,123
I just forgot about it because
I'm really tired today.

47
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,763
You're not my mom.

48
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,003
- Ji A.
- Where's my mom?

49
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,673
I am your mom.

50
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:49,303
Honey!

51
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:54,183
Come here!

52
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,633
Ji A, open the door.

53
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,462
Come outside. Let's talk.

54
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,732
Ji A, be a good girl.

55
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,053
You little brat.

56
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,383
A Eum.

57
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:10,823
Are you A Eum?

58
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:38,782
I guess not.

59
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,423
You're not A Eum.

60
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:51,763
Forget everything you saw today.

61
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:56,532
If you don't...

62
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,683
Road 144, Yeou Gogae.

63
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,453
A sedan rolled over.

64
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:16,352
I see bloodstains on the
driver's and passenger seat.

65
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:18,092
It looks like they
shed a lot of blood.

66
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,323
But I don't see any bodies.

67
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,372
Mom. Dad.

68
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,342
Yes, the only survivor
is a little girl.

69
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,112
Mom!

70
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,342
- Dad!
- Are you okay?

71
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,512
My parents are gone.

72
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:48,722
Will you help me find them?

73
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:51,023
I'll find them for
you. Don't worry.

74
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:53,653
Do you remember how
the accident happened?

75
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,193
Were you here by yourself?

76
00:08:56,822 --> 00:09:00,962
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 1: THE INCIDENT

79
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,413
Please eat ice cream after
you eat your breakfast.

80
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,242
Why is it raining? I didn't see
this on the weather forecast.

81
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,443
Gosh, I know. I got
my hair done today.

82
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:24,612
- It's all wet.
- My goodness, you're right.

83
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,382
Your hair is all wet.

84
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,553
That's because a fox is
getting married today.

85
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,053
What was that?

86
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,573
He's handsome.

87
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:46,502
- Can you take a photo for us?
- Sure.

88
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,502
1, 2, 3.

89
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,972
- Let me see.
- It came out really nice.

90
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:52,612
- Does it look nice?
- You look beautiful.

91
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,313
You didn't send me a
wedding invitation.

92
00:10:57,643 --> 00:10:59,453
Will you please excuse us?

93
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,382
- Who is he?
- Is he your ex?

94
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:03,453
- You should introduce him to us.
- Get out.

95
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:18,203
Lee Yeon, what are
you doing here?

96
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,703
I'm not here to
catch your bouquet.

97
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:21,703
How did you find me?

98
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,643
How did you manage
to hide so well?

99
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,043
Do you think you can get rid
of your bloodthirsty past...

100
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,082
just by changing your
looks and identity?

101
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:31,183
But you need to know that
changing your identity...

102
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,683
isn't as simple as you think.

103
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,082
- Please forgive me.
- It's too late for that.

104
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:39,453
I've changed. I don't
harm humans anymore.

105
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,663
Listen, you fox.

106
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:45,092
How could you dare dream
of having a happy ending...

107
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:47,132
after eating so many livers?

108
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,543
I'm in love now.

109
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,472
I want to live as a
human being. Please.

110
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:57,742
How romantic.

111
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,443
But you're still
going to die today.

112
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,143
You also once loved
a human being.

113
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,582
I'm sure you understand.

114
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:06,813
You must not know this.

115
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:10,923
But first of all, I hate it
when people bring up my past.

116
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,553
And second of all,
don't even dare...

117
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,393
to take out your claws.

118
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,433
- Goodbye.
- Just once.

119
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:25,173
Let me see him
just one last time.

120
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,403
Here's a piece of advice. It's
completely useless to do that.

121
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:32,173
Please. It's my last wish.

122
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:37,443
It's time for the wedding.

123
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,553
Oh, okay.

124
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,193
You need to go in now. Let's go.

125
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,293
Just until the ceremony ends.

126
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:57,163
There may be entities
living among us...

127
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,832
that we are unaware of.

128
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:03,203
Perhaps the many
urban legends...

129
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:05,242
are really about them.

130
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,813
- What do you think?
- Did you revise the script again?

131
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,283
The writer will faint.

132
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,242
- Will she be really mad?
- Of course.

133
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,313
Notwithstanding that, the
revision is much better, right?

134
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,683
Of course. What?

135
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,183
Then go with this.

136
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,393
A production director
needs to have guts.

137
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:21,023
It's really strange.

138
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,462
I don't believe in
monsters or ghosts,

139
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:24,832
but this scares me.

140
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:28,663
I'm not scared at all,
but I believe in them.

141
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,632
You do? Why?

142
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,303
Did you see one in real life?

143
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:37,372
Mom. Dad.

144
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,143
- Yes.
- Really?

145
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:42,082
You're just trying to scare me.

146
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:44,953
You can tell yourself that.

147
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,122
The weather stinks.

148
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,722
They say rain on your wedding day
means you'll have a happy marriage.

149
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:54,722
Congratulations!

150
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,163
Congratulations!

151
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,043
- The meal tickets.
- We're good.

152
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,342
No, no. We'll take them.

153
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:12,043
All you get after giving
an expensive gift is food.

154
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,643
I can never digest wedding food.

155
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:15,683
Why do you think that is?

156
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:19,553
The air filled with forced
happiness suffocates me.

157
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,323
You should try to absorb the
forced happiness near you at times.

158
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,653
Who knows? You may meet the man
you're destined to be with here.

159
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,462
<font color="#00ff00">EMERGENCY. THE
INFORMANT FLAKED.</font>

160
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:32,462
I need a story that
I'm destined to cover.

161
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,163
The informant flaked.

162
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:43,303
The pyebaek room is this way.

163
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,913
- Come this way.
- Please come with me.

164
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,173
Former master of Baekdudaegan.

165
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,903
By what authority
do you convict us?

166
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,012
Listen to this brat.

167
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:24,212
I'd be watching American TV shows
and having ice cream if not for you.

168
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,783
You're just a nine-tailed
fox stripped of...

169
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,553
your mountain spirit status
for breaking a taboo.

170
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:30,352
That's why I'm
paying for it now.

171
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:42,962
Help me!

172
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:45,232
Help me!

173
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:51,972
Who are you?

174
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:54,573
Do you really think you
can hide dressed like that?

175
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:55,712
Who are you?

176
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:57,543
Who are you?

177
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,512
You really won't listen.

178
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:45,462
No.

179
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,812
- No.
- Don't look. Please.

180
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,863
How foolish.

181
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:19,262
You should've run away
when you had the time.

182
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:21,562
I wanted to be a bride.

183
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:26,833
Don't do something stupid like
falling in love in your next time.

184
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,802
I have one last favor to ask.

185
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,042
Please...

186
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,913
remove only the good memories
of me from his memory.

187
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:38,752
Sure.

188
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,623
Listen carefully.

189
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,462
Your bride...

190
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,403
Hey. She's not bad.

191
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,472
Hey. Keep it down.
You'll get me in trouble.

192
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:34,532
You look good.

193
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:36,572
Do I?

194
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,373
How could this happen?

195
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,242
How could this happen?

196
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,012
Wait here.

197
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,653
What now?

198
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,853
- Hey, this is huge.
- What happened?

199
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,222
The wedding in the
next room was canceled.

200
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:50,653
Really?

201
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,373
Who was he again?

202
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:24,252
Who is he? Do you know him?

203
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:29,193
- No.
- Should I find out?

204
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,193
- What?
- How that peaceful wedding...

205
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:34,762
turned into Pandora's Box.

206
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,433
Who knows? That may be the story
you were destined to cover.

207
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,022
The bride ran away.

208
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,123
She ran away?

209
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,193
Sure, that's possible.

210
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:04,093
But what kind of an
enlightenment must you obtain...

211
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,262
to make such an expensive
about-face in life?

212
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,962
True love.

213
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:10,302
- Did she have a guy?
- Yes.

214
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:13,532
He said, "She's my woman."

215
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,143
Then the bride grabbed
his hand and said,

216
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:19,212
"I'm going with my love."

217
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,742
All the witnesses
said the same thing.

218
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,353
There's a sign of resistance.

219
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,883
- Isn't that blood?
- There was a scuffle.

220
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,482
No one mentioned that.

221
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:31,752
Most importantly,

222
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,792
why is this dress here?

223
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,193
Because she took it off...

224
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,322
You're right. What
did she leave in?

225
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,893
The witness statements and
the scene of the incident...

226
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:43,032
are telling different stories.

227
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,272
Were they mass
hypnotized or something?

228
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:49,742
I need to see what that woman
of this love story looks like.

229
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,403
Okay. I'll get a video.

230
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:12,663
It's fox fur.

231
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,863
- Fox?
- A red fox.

232
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,103
A native of Korea.

233
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:18,972
The native foxes are extinct.

234
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:20,873
Oh my.

235
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,302
There's something you
actually don't know.

236
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:27,742
In 2012, they started a
business reviving foxes.

237
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,613
Look.

238
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,983
<font color="#00ff00">EXTINCT FOX SPECIES
REVIVED AFTER 40 YEARS</font>

239
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,482
How was a fox native
to Mount Sobaek...

240
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:37,123
found near here?

241
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,722
One was caught in an
apartment complex in Gyeongju,

242
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,863
and one even crossed the
DMZ into North Korea.

243
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:44,863
So showing up in a wedding
hall in Gangnam is nothing.

244
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:47,893
Hungry wild hogs rampage
through convenience stores.

245
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:55,242
All the foxes of Mount
Sobaek have GPS trackers.

246
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:58,042
None of them came to Seoul yet.

247
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,913
I was an assistant director for
an animal show for two years.

248
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:05,282
Okay. So where could
this have come from?

249
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:15,923
Please pick up.

250
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,232
I'm in love with someone.

251
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:28,133
I want to live as a
human being. Please.

252
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,203
A selfie? Now?

253
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,472
Nice.

254
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:34,312
Smile.

255
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:36,883
You loved a human once.

256
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:38,512
You understand
how I feel, right?

257
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,322
Here.

258
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,992
Thank you.

259
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:22,722
So Yoon!

260
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,062
Are you an alien?

261
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,873
- No.
- Then what are you?

262
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,502
- A nine-tailed fox.
- Are you over 100 years old?

263
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:39,173
Actually, I'm over 1,000.

264
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,512
What are you doing here though?

265
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:46,453
Nothing other than
waiting for someone.

266
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,413
- As in who?
- My first love.

267
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,683
Why?

268
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,693
Because a fox can only
love one person...

269
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:56,962
till death.

270
00:23:57,093 --> 00:24:00,292
My mom waits for the
delivery man every day.

271
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:01,933
She only has to wait two days.

272
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:07,032
Not for me even after
100 or 1,000 nights.

273
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,843
- How are you coping with that?
- Not well.

274
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:10,603
Then what if I kept you company?

275
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,873
- No.
- Why not?

276
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:15,883
Just look at you. I hate
those with a runny nose.

277
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:21,383
Besides, humans die too early
to properly have a friendship.

278
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,663
I'm saying that life is short,

279
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:32,333
so try your best in life...

280
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,663
but know to let go when
something's too unbearable.

281
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,962
It extends to people, love,

282
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:40,433
and so on and so forth.

283
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,002
- Okay?
- Okay!

How have you been, Granny?

288
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,242
You haven't been around much.

289
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,113
I've been busy, thanks to you.

290
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:03,782
Never did I imagine...

291
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:05,792
seeing the great Taluipa
struggle to operate a computer.

292
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,593
What can I do when
the world has changed?

293
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,693
The Afterlife should have
a five-day workweek too.

294
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:15,802
Did you get my text?

295
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,462
- About the female fox?
- Why was there no response?

296
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:21,802
Do I seem like someone who has
the time to listen to sob stories?

297
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:25,373
You're to obey the order and
capture whom you're sent after.

298
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:30,982
Until when must I carry this on?

299
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,383
Have you lost your mind?

300
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:36,383
Did they serve rat poison
at the wedding ceremony?

301
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:37,552
How can one not lose it...

302
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,893
after following orders as
a soldier for 600 years?

303
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:42,193
As a soldier?

304
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:44,222
Nobody forced you to give up...

305
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:46,833
being a mountain spirit
and live this way.

306
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:48,863
You're the one who
chose this life...

307
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,562
in return for that
girl's resurrection.

308
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,443

spirit of Baekdudaegan,"

309
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,072

disrupt the order..."

310

Foxes never stay in debt, right?

313
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:07,782
Darn it.

314
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:12,222
So tell me...

315
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:16,163
Do you want your freedom back?

316
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:33,472
You'll end up in the Underworld.

317
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:35,542
- What?
- I'll pray for it every day.

318
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:37,683
How dare you.

319
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,252
And stop munching on
glucosamine tablets.

320
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:43,752
Having a kind heart is
the key to healthy joints.

324
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,792
What the... Is he
leaving already?

325
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,333
Darling!

326
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:02,873
Have some tteokbokki.

327
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:04,972
I've lost my appetite
because of that jerk.

328
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:08,712
Goodness, don't be so harsh.

329
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:12,353
Be more considerate of his
heart that awaits a dead woman.

330
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,653
This again? Stop
being such a sap.

331
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,353
You're absolutely clueless
when it comes to love.

332
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,752
I should have the
tteokbokki all by myself.

333
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:25,593
Mr. Lee, why haven't
you been picking up?

334
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,232
- What is it?
- It's a Code Red!

335
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,802
- Tell me what it is.
- Where are you right now?

340
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,822
Someone revised my script again.

341
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,992
Are you trying to
pick a fight with me?

342
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:55,153
I committed a mortal sin.

343
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,322
Your attitude says otherwise.

344
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:59,562
- Are they at it again?
- Should we fight it out?

345
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,992
- Yes, let's.
- No, don't.

346
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,762
Just stay out of it, sir.

347
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:04,962
I'm back!

348
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,873
- Did you find something?
- I'm not sure.

349
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,603
Is it about the runaway bride?

350
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:11,373
Bring it over so that
I can see the face.

351
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:15,312
A red umbrella with an
embroidered pattern?

352
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,242
He has weird taste.

353
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:18,712
I got the footage that
has the best angle of him.

354
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:20,183
This is him going in...

355
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:21,512
and this is him going out.

356
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:24,853
His face is completely
hidden under the umbrella.

357
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:28,292
Hold on a second. It didn't
rain after the wedding.

358
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,962
Then he's the intelligent type.

359
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:34,492
I get why he's alone
when he entered,

360
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,403
but why also on the way out?

361
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:38,163
- She can't be found.
- What?

362
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:41,373
I checked all the footage
from the wedding hall,

363
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,002
but I couldn't see
the bride leaving it.

364
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:09,532
Have you been listening to me?

365
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:11,002
- Regarding what?
- That...

366
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:14,133
That female director
brought over fox fur.

367
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:17,272
- Did you get caught?
- When I'm a seasoned veteran?

368
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:20,113
I'm now up to the point
where I'm wondering...

369
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:21,572
if I've turned into
an actual person.

370
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:22,883
You must be proud.

371
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:25,143
Anyway, I'm getting a bad vibe.

372
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:38,663
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Somewhat.

373
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,232
- Installments?
- A single payment, please.

374
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:47,673
Mr. Lee, there... Over there!

375
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:48,873
What now?

376
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:51,943
<font color="#00ff00">"UNVEILING URBAN LEGENDS"</font>

377
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:54,272
That's you, right? Oh, no!

378
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:58,782
Maybe you shouldn't carry around
that umbrella for the time being.

379
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:01,083
This? No.

380
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:03,153
Tell that human...

381
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,153
to catch me if you can.

382
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:09,363
- Are you serious?
- What...

383
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:12,463
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN

384
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:16,062
What did I tell you
about that bad vibe?

385
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:18,703
That show's actually
quite famous.

386
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:34,512
- Are you the one with the tip?
- Oh, yes.

387
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:36,322
I'm the director for
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

388
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,482
Could I get an autograph later?

389
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,492
I watch each episode
about 20 times, you see.

390
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:41,853
Please have a seat.

391
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:47,893
So you saw him?

392
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,373
- Of course.
- Who is he?

393
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,742
- A monster.
- A monster?

394
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,512
He never ages or dies.

395
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:04,613
Like goblins and aliens
you see in movies.

396
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:12,492
- I see you don't believe me.
- If I'm being honest, no.

397
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,222
You shouldn't
underestimate me though.

398
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:16,693
I don't lie.

399
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:18,562
May I ask what you
do for a living?

400
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,762
I'm studying for the state exam.

401
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,633
- And your hometown?
- Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

402
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:28,002
My mother, who has always
been a farmer, has one wish...

403
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:30,042
which is to see me work
at a decent office.

404
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:32,542
Take care, then.

405
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,113
I have more to tell you.

406
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:37,443
Your backstory doesn't
match your shoes.

407
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,183
What kind of student can
afford customized shoes...

408
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:41,353
that are worth 4,000 dollars?

409
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,953
You don't have an accent from
Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

410
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:46,853
That already tells me that I
shouldn't be wasting my time.

411
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:48,853
- Bye then.
- Yeou Gogae.

412
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:54,762
"Yeou Gogae"?

413
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,703
That's where I saw him.

414
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:06,913
How can I trust something
coming from an unidentified man?

415
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:10,383
You can check for yourself.

416
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:37,472
Hey, you're back.

417
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:42,272
Gosh, I picked the
wrong pair of shoes.

418
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,583
She noticed that right away.

419
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:46,782
But why are you smiling?

420
00:33:46,782 --> 00:33:48,052
I like her.

421
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:50,923
What do you like about her?

422
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:53,453
I like her from head to toe.

423
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:56,292
Then should we eat her...

424
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:58,062
from head to toe?

425
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,863
No, not yet.

426
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,813
Which flavor do you want?

427
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:15,842
- Mint chocolate.
- That's all you ever eat.

428
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:20,552
I noticed that you're a
regular, so I gave you a lot.

429
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:27,592
Next time, just give
me the usual amount.

430
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:29,623
- Pardon?
- When I'm indebted to someone,

431
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:31,862
I'm obligated to
return the favor.

432
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,112
The number you've called
doesn't exist, you punk.

433
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:53,112
Long time no see.

434
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:56,523
- What do you want?
- I just missed you.

435
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,253
What are you doing?

436
00:34:58,322 --> 00:34:59,353
I'm busy. Hang up.

437
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:01,253
You don't look very busy.

438
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:06,393
Let's meet.

439
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,492
I refuse.

440
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:10,262
I'll set your house on fire.

441
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,933
You're 600 years old.
Stop acting like a kid.

442
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,132
You'll regret it.

443
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:17,242
- No, I won't.
- Are you still waiting...

444
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:19,472
for your dead girlfriend?

445
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,842
I heard an interesting rumor.

446
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,713
Should I tell you what it is?

447
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:34,722
Don't try to mess with me.

448
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:36,523
If you want to
know, come meet me.

449
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:01,512
Tonight, go to the place I told
you about and get on a bus.

450
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:03,822
But I have one condition.

451
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,253
What's that?

452
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:06,652
You must come alone.

Hey, do you direct TV shows?

456
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:37,422
- Yes.
- My dream is to become a director.

457
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:40,023
You should become
something else.

458
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,492
I've been working today
for 22 hours straight.

459
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:01,273

- Sir.

460
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:02,572
Are you okay?

461
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:08,913
Are you going to get
on the bus or not?

462
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,083
I'm coming. Just a second.

463
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:13,353
Get up. Let me take
you to a hospital.

464
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:14,523
Get off me!

465
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:16,922
Sir, I need to get on this bus.

466
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,963
- Hey, let's just go.
- My gosh.

467
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:21,333
- Are you not coming?
- I'm going. Just a second.

468
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,032
Don't go, you brat!

469
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,302

- Don't go, you brat!

It's him.

00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:34,648
Just take me to that

478

479
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:44,159
You're a lot heavier
than you seem.

480
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:48,128
How strange.

481
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,068
He's so heavy.

482
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:53,969
I can't even hear him breathing.

483
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:56,938
Sir.

484
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:11,088
It... It hurts.

485
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:51,358
Please... Your hand...

486
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:58,599
We're here.

487
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:04,239
You should cut down on alcohol.

488
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,449
Don't think I'll give
you credit for this.

489
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,278
I already paid you back.

490
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:10,849
What?

491
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:22,429
Sir, wait.

492
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,458
Where to?

493
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,028
Please follow the route
of bus number 1002.

494
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:39,909
Sir, did you see the old
man who was behind me?

495
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:42,679
Who are you talking about?
You're the only person I saw.

496
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:25,719
Hello? I'd like to
report an accident.

497
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,989
Road 144.

498
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:28,559
Yes, it's Yeou Gogae.

499
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:32,128
"Yeou Gogae"?

500
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:48,248
Road 144, Fox Ridge.

501
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:51,349
My parents are gone.

502
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:57,688
No.

503
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:06,628
Excuse me.

504
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:19,878
Excuse me. Wake up.

505
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:24,918
Hey.

506
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:47,009
Hey.

507
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:18,838
I said no pictures!

508
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:21,039
You need to stop
them. Seriously.

509
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,978
Hey, Ji A. What
are you doing here?

510
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:29,978
Detective Baek. You almost had
to process my corpse today.

511
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:31,219
What are you talking about?

512
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:33,889
- I almost got on that bus.
- What?

513
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:38,389
That was my bus. I was
supposed to be on it.

514
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,519
Are you serious?

515
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,188
- 5 are dead, and 1 survived.
- Really?

516
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:44,528
- There should be one more person.
- What?

517
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:46,798
There were seven
people on this bus.

518
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:47,869
Are you sure?

519
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:49,599
I saw with my own eyes.

520
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:56,978
He's the only one missing.

521
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,949
There's no body or anything.

522
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,409
He probably got off.

523
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:04,248
No. This bus didn't stop
before the accident.

524
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,789
There's no bus
stop in the tunnel.

525
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:13,389
I need to check
something. Get out.

526
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:15,259
Hurry it up.

527
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:19,798
<font color="#00ff00">"DEATH TRAP ROAD 144!
ONLY 1 OUT OF 6 SURVIVED"</font>

528
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,728
"Only 1 out of 6 survived."

529
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,969
- Let's go.
- Too many people died.

530
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,409
- So?
- Just leave it.

531
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:32,708
I have to finish it by myself.

532
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,079
<font color="#00ff00">JUNG SOO YOUNG</font>

533
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,759
Soo Young. Do you recognize me?

534
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,358
We met at the bus stop.

535
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:57,599
Do you remember how
the accident occurred?

536
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:10,418
You must be scared because you
were the only one who survived.

537
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,418
I was in a similar
accident a long time ago.

538
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,559
That's why I'm all alone.

539
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,728
If you put your mind to it,

540
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:24,199
a tragedy can become a
very convenient shield.

541
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:27,528
Because everyone fusses over you
and pours out their sympathy.

542
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:31,469
But I hope you'll become strong.

543
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:36,509
It's much more fun being a
production director than a victim.

544
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:01,269
Contact me if you need anything.

545
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:09,838
Did you see that young man
who sat by the window...

546
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:11,039
on the right side of the bus?

547
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:14,708
He had an umbrella like this.

548
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:24,458
You did see him.

549
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:28,028
What did you see? What
was it, that you're so...

550
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:29,829
He's coming.

551
00:46:30,898 --> 00:46:31,958
What?

552
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:33,568
He's coming to kill me.

553
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:36,628
He'll come to kill me too.

554
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:44,639
Jae Hwan. Tell Detective Baek to
send some people to the hospital.

555
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:47,778
Yes. What about the
camera from the bus?

556
00:46:47,778 --> 00:46:48,849
It's blank.

557
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:51,949
It's the same as
the wedding hall.

558
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:55,519
- What about on the road?
- There aren't any at all.

559
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,398
I'm looking for the teenage
girl who was admitted...

560
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:08,269
after the bus
accident yesterday.

561
00:47:09,898 --> 00:47:11,168
Are you together?

562
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:12,539
What?

563
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,818
Found him.

564
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:36,028
<font color="#00ff00">WOOJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL</font>

565
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:38,398
Why does a TV station's production
director want to see me?

566
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:42,168
This voice. It couldn't be.

567
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:44,469
Why do you think?

568
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:46,869
Are you scouting me
to become an idol?

569
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:51,338
But sorry, I can't
sing or dance.

570
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,378
My only talent is my face.

571
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:59,048
Yes, I'm scouting
you, but not for that.

572
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:01,619
- Then?
- Fox Ridge.

573
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,088
Is it a horror movie?

574
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:07,559
It's an urban legend.

575
00:48:08,228 --> 00:48:11,858
For example, 1 passenger on
the 1002 bus disappeared.

576
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:13,528
Like he evaporated
into thin air.

577
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:16,228
It doesn't sound like
it'll be very well-made.

578
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,599
Plus, I'm more into rom-com.

579
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,278
What about this?

580
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:31,418
That color photographs
really well.

581
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,648
I don't know if it's
a coincidence or fate,

582
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:37,489
but I saw you three
times already.

583
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,528
First, it was in a wedding hall
in which a bride disappeared.

584
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:43,059
Second, on the 1002 bus.

585
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:47,199
Third, at this hospital where
I came to meet the victim.

586
00:48:52,168 --> 00:48:53,608
Let's say it was fate.

587
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:56,838
But sorry to disappoint.
I'm seeing someone.

588
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:58,708
Plus, I'm very devoted.

589
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:01,978
Did you kill them?

590
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:10,688
Or did you come to kill her?

591
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:18,259
I met someone that I
want to kill. Just now.

592
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,409
Where is he? He said he'd
be back in 10 minutes.

593
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:38,478
Don't people usually have
evidence to back them up...

594
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:40,119
when they ask rude
questions like that?

595
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,088
Like physical
proof or witnesses.

596
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,958
Or at least a police badge.

597
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,329
You're right. I was very
rude, wasn't I? I'm sorry.

598
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,728
I don't need your empty apology.

599
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,369
You didn't touch your coffee.

600
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:58,938
Have some.

601
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:01,838
I don't eat or drink
anything from strangers.

602
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,608
It's such a dangerous world.

603
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:06,878
One more thing.

604
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:08,949
What now?

605
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:10,978
- What's your name?
- Who knows?

606
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:12,849
Why don't you try to find out?

607
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:15,449
Wait.

608
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,418
At least take my business card.

609
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:20,858
It's inside.

610
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:26,099
What is this, a blind date?

611
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,469
I don't want a second date.

612
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:44,079
Hey, Jae Hwan. Ask Detective
Baek to run a fingerprint for me.

613
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,248
Yes.

614
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,259
A leather bag.

615
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:54,958
This is totally fate.

616
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:58,559
The little girl whose life you
saved 20-plus years ago showed up.

617
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,969
She must not even remember.

618
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,429
I don't like it.

619
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:03,668
She really does look like her.

620
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:06,099
I get surprised every
time I see her too.

621
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,239
You should quit consulting
for that TV station.

622
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:11,378
No. That's directly
related to my livelihood.

623
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:12,938
It's just a B-rated program.

624
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:16,378
It's the only show you enjoy.
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

625
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,918
You even posted a comment
on their website...

626
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:21,148
that the Grim Reaper's
outfit was all wrong.

627
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:23,048
I know Grim Reapers well...

628
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:24,858
Concentrate on driving.

629
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,398
Soo Young, are you all right?

630
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:12,998
I told you to keep
an eye on her.

631
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:14,869
I only left the room
for about five minutes.

632
00:52:15,668 --> 00:52:18,278
- Did you catch the guy?
- No one saw even a shadow.

633
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:20,239
Maybe she's just dreaming.

634
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:22,079
I'm not!

635
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,778
Ji A, I don't want to stay here.

636
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:26,048
I must leave.

637
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:28,989
Soo Young.

638
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:33,389
If I stay,

639
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:35,858
I'll die.

642
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:05,688
I don't if my clothes will fit.

643
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:08,159
I'm sorry for putting
you out like this.

644
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:09,688
It's only for the night.

645
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:12,128
What about your family?

646
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,869
I live alone, so make
yourself at home.

647
00:53:26,108 --> 00:53:27,248
She's all alone.

648
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:39,675
When did she get discharged?

649
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,044
It hasn't been long.

650
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:44,084
She asked me to
give this to you.

651
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:47,115
- Who...
- The lady who took the patient.

652
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:17,584
Soo Young?

653
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:20,624
Why aren't you in bed?

654
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:22,124
I suddenly remembered...

655
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:25,394
what happened in
the tunnel that day.

656
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:40,874
The bus entered the tunnel.

657
00:54:43,144 --> 00:54:44,845
I took out my earphones...

658
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:49,144
only to be met with silence.

659
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:22,644
Do you want...

660
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,354
Everyone was dead.

661
00:55:31,055 --> 00:55:32,354
From the darkness,

662
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:36,224
he began to approach me.

663
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:38,595
He?

664
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,334
The man with the umbrella.

665
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:44,175
What did that man do?

666
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,104
He tried to kill me!

667
00:55:53,244 --> 00:55:54,684
I was terrified.

668
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:05,294
It's all right.
It'll be all fine.

669
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:10,164
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

670
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:11,595
- Lift up your feet.
- I'm good.

671
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:18,204
Soo Young, where were you headed
in the middle of the night?

672
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:21,445
What? Home, of course...

673
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:24,874
I checked your address
and in order to do so,

674
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,244
you had to be going
the other way.

675
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,715
You see, that night...

676
00:56:30,715 --> 00:56:32,854
Stop blabbering
whatever comes to mind.

677
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,055
Ji A...

678
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:48,305
When did you figure it out?

679
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:53,635
Humans...

680
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,604
instinctively move to
protect themselves...

681
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:58,115
when involved in car accidents.

682
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:02,885
However, the sole survivor
of that bus crash...

683
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,584
had no defensive wounds.

684
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:14,865
I don't believe in
miracles, you see.

685
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:17,765
Who are you?

686
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,334
I'm someone you know...

687
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:27,075
and also someone you don't.

688
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:30,774
How...

689
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:34,885
Where's the real Soo Young?

690
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:36,184
I ate her.

691
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,825
As if something like
this could hurt me.

692
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:51,664
I know.

693
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:55,664
I only offered myself as bait.

694
00:57:56,604 --> 00:57:57,635
Bait?

695
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:03,544
Hey, you. Didn't I reject
your proposal earlier?

696
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:06,544
What you're looking for
will be at my house.

697
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,485
Shouldn't you get busy?

698
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:23,024
- Did you miss me?
- As if, brother.

699
00:58:23,494 --> 00:58:25,235
- Brother?
- It's a long story,

700
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,035
but the family has a dirty past.

701
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:41,744
This is why kids
must be disciplined.

702
00:59:08,474 --> 00:59:10,445
How many people have you killed?

703
00:59:10,445 --> 00:59:12,144
Are you worried I'll be
sucked into the Underworld?

704
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:14,485
No, it's because
you embarrass me.

705
00:59:15,215 --> 00:59:17,445
This is because I don't want
a pathetic life like yours.

706
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:20,084
What's more pathetic is
a grown man who whines.

707
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:31,195
Time out. How about
a bet instead?

708
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:33,735
Old habits really do die hard.

709
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,765
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

710
00:59:36,465 --> 00:59:37,805
this woman will die.

711
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,474
- What?
- You know I'm not joking.

712
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:48,244
I'll see you around.

713
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:07,664
You... Who on earth
are you people?

714
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,744
Forget everything about me.

715
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:27,985
<font color="#00ff00">DETECTIVE BAEK</font>

716
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:35,164
I got the result back on the
fingerprint you wanted an ID on.

717
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:43,104
As if something like
this could hurt me.

718
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:47,704
I only offered myself as bait.

719
01:00:48,204 --> 01:00:49,244
Bait?

720
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:50,845
Shin Ju, is that you?

721
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,144
Why are all the doors open?

722
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:56,184
Did you miss me?

723
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:57,684
- As if, brother.
- Brother?

724
01:00:57,684 --> 01:01:00,255
It's a long story, but the
family has a dirty past.

725
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:01,385
What's going on?

726
01:01:03,354 --> 01:01:05,325
This is why kids
must be disciplined.

727
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:15,334
How many people have you killed?

728
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:17,064
Are you worried I'll be
sucked into the Underworld?

729
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,905
No, it's because
you embarrass me.

730
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:21,945
This is because I don't want
a pathetic life like yours.

731
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,644
What's more pathetic is
a grown man who whines.

732
01:01:38,325 --> 01:01:39,494
Do you like it?

733
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:42,425
How did you come here?

734
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:46,894
Name. Lee Yeon.
Age. 36 years old.

735
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:49,104
It's pretty obvious that you
live with a fake identity.

736
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,974
Now, I can proudly
say that it's fate.

737
01:01:53,604 --> 01:01:55,175
You remember what happened?

738
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:57,945
I don't know what it is, but
I guess it didn't work on me.

739
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:00,675
What do you want?

740
01:02:01,644 --> 01:02:02,814
The original copy is in here.

741
01:02:03,244 --> 01:02:04,684
If you want it,
come and take it.

742
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:02,974
I knew it. You're not human.

743
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,244
Did you just test me?

744
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:18,555
Forget everything you saw today.

745
01:03:19,024 --> 01:03:20,454
If you don't,

746
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:25,794
I'll kill you.

747
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:31,474
I've been waiting for you.
