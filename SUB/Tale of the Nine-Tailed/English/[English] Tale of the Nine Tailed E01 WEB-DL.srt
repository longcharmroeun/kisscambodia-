7
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:58,973
When a fox turns 100,

8
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,112
it can transform into
a beautiful woman...

9
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:04,642
or become a man who
has relations with one.

10
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,153
However, a fox of 1,000 years
receives the sky's blessing...

11
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,522
and becomes a celestial fox.

12
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,153
Its abilities match that
of a powerful shaman...

13
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,393
which allows it to see
what are miles ahead.

14
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:25,162
I was going to wait
until we get home,

15
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:28,702
but here's your
birthday present.

16
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,013
Do you like your gift?

17
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,982
Yes, I love it.

<font color="#00ff00">1999, YEOU GOGAE</font>

19
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,053
Ji A.

20
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,803
Help.

21
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,203
Help.

22
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,603
My princess, you're up.

23
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,803
Thank goodness. It was a dream.

24
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,842
President Kim Dae Jung...

25
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,312
- Here you go.
- Here's our fruit.

26
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,682
Mom, I love you. I
love you so much.

27
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:29,923
What's gotten into you?

28
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,622
Dad, I love you. I
love you so much.

29
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:36,263
My goodness. I also love
you very much, Ji A.

30
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:39,222
Did you have a bad dream?

31
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:40,793
I don't even want
to think about it.

32
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:43,962
- My goodness.
- They will be sticking to the plan.

33
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:10,992
Many people got injured due
to the fire that broke out...

34
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:13,593
at Seongjin Market this evening.

35
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,163
The fire broke out at 7pm...

36
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,863
and got extinguished after having
burned down three buildings.

37
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:22,332
The fire caused severe
damage to the market,

38
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:25,702
and a total of 22 people
ended up getting injured.

39
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,613
The fire broke out in a
cramped space in the market...

40
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,283
and spread throughout...

41
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:36,322
Mom, I'm hungry.

42
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,322
- Do you want some fruit?
- No.

43
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,822
I want walnut cookies.

44
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,332
Let's see. Where did I
put the walnut cookies?

45
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,103
I think we ate them all.

46
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,242
Can I get them for you tomorrow?

47
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,142
We never buy walnut cookies.

48
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,082
I had to go to the hospital
because it turned out...

49
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:08,413
I was allergic to nuts.

50
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,452
Oh, right. I forgot.

51
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,653
My mom never forgets that
because she's a doctor.

52
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,223
I just forgot about it because
I'm really tired today.

53
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:21,863
You're not my mom.

54
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:26,103
- Ji A.
- Where's my mom?

55
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,773
I am your mom.

56
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,403
Honey!

57
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:36,283
Come here!

58
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,733
Ji A, open the door.

59
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,562
Come outside. Let's talk.

60
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,832
Ji A, be a good girl.

61
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,153
You little brat.

62
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,483
A Eum.

63
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:52,923
Are you A Eum?

64
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,882
I guess not.

65
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,523
You're not A Eum.

66
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,863
Forget everything you saw today.

67
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:38,632
If you don't...

68
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,783
Road 144, Yeou Gogae.

69
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:54,553
A sedan rolled over.

70
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,452
I see bloodstains on the
driver's and passenger seat.

71
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,192
It looks like they
shed a lot of blood.

72
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:04,423
But I don't see any bodies.

73
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:17,472
Mom. Dad.

74
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:19,442
Yes, the only survivor
is a little girl.

75
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,212
Mom!

76
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,442
- Dad!
- Are you okay?

77
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:27,612
My parents are gone.

78
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:30,822
Will you help me find them?

79
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:33,123
I'll find them for
you. Don't worry.

80
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:35,753
Do you remember how
the accident happened?

81
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,293
Were you here by yourself?

82

you eat your breakfast.

86
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,342
Why is it raining? I didn't see
this on the weather forecast.

87
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,543
Gosh, I know. I got
my hair done today.

88
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,712
- It's all wet.
- My goodness, you're right.

89
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,482
Your hair is all wet.

90
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,653
That's because a fox is
getting married today.

91
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:14,153
What was that?

92
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:26,673
He's handsome.

93
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,602
- Can you take a photo for us?
- Sure.

94
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:30,602
1, 2, 3.

95
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,072
- Let me see.
- It came out really nice.

96
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:34,712
- Does it look nice?
- You look beautiful.

97
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:36,413
You didn't send me a
wedding invitation.

98
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,553
Will you please excuse us?

99
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,482
- Who is he?
- Is he your ex?

100
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,553
- You should introduce him to us.
- Get out.

101
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,303
Lee Yeon, what are
you doing here?

102
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,803
I'm not here to
catch your bouquet.

103
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:03,803
How did you find me?

104
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,743
How did you manage
to hide so well?

105
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,143
Do you think you can get rid
of your bloodthirsty past...

106
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,182
just by changing your
looks and identity?

107
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,283
But you need to know that
changing your identity...

108
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,783
isn't as simple as you think.

109
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,182
- Please forgive me.
- It's too late for that.

110
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:21,553
I've changed. I don't
harm humans anymore.

111
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:23,763
Listen, you fox.

112
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,192
How could you dare dream
of having a happy ending...

113
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,232
after eating so many livers?

114
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,643
I'm in love now.

115
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,572
I want to live as a
human being. Please.

116
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:39,842
How romantic.

117
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:42,543
But you're still
going to die today.

118
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,243
You also once loved
a human being.

119
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:45,682
I'm sure you understand.

120
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,913
You must not know this.

121
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:53,023
But first of all, I hate it
when people bring up my past.

122
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,653
And second of all,
don't even dare...

123
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,493
to take out your claws.

124
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,533
- Goodbye.
- Just once.

125
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,273
Let me see him
just one last time.

126
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,503
Here's a piece of advice. It's
completely useless to do that.

127
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:14,273
Please. It's my last wish.

128
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,543
It's time for the wedding.

129
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,653
Oh, okay.

130
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:28,293
You need to go in now. Let's go.

131
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,393
Just until the ceremony ends.

132
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:39,263
There may be entities
living among us...

133
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,932
that we are unaware of.

134
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:45,303
Perhaps the many
urban legends...

135
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,342
are really about them.

136
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,913
- What do you think?
- Did you revise the script again?

137
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,383
The writer will faint.

138
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,342
- Will she be really mad?
- Of course.

139
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,413
Notwithstanding that, the
revision is much better, right?

140
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,783
Of course. What?

141
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,283
Then go with this.

142
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:01,493
A production director
needs to have guts.

143
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,123
It's really strange.

144
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,562
I don't believe in
monsters or ghosts,

145
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:06,932
but this scares me.

146
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:10,763
I'm not scared at all,
but I believe in them.

147
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,732
You do? Why?

148
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,403
Did you see one in real life?

149
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,472
Mom. Dad.

150
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,243
- Yes.
- Really?

151
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:24,182
You're just trying to scare me.

152
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:27,053
You can tell yourself that.

153
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,222
The weather stinks.

154
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:33,822
They say rain on your wedding day
means you'll have a happy marriage.

155
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:36,822
Congratulations!

156
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,263
Congratulations!

157
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,143
- The meal tickets.
- We're good.

158
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,442
No, no. We'll take them.

159
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:54,143
All you get after giving
an expensive gift is food.

160
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,743
I can never digest wedding food.

161
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:57,783
Why do you think that is?

162
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:01,653
The air filled with forced
happiness suffocates me.

163
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:04,423
You should try to absorb the
forced happiness near you at times.

164
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:06,753
Who knows? You may meet the man
you're destined to be with here.

165
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:12,562
<font color="#00ff00">EMERGENCY. THE
INFORMANT FLAKED.</font>

166
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:14,562
I need a story that
I'm destined to cover.

167
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,263
The informant flaked.

168
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:25,403
The pyebaek room is this way.

169
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:28,013
- Come this way.
- Please come with me.

170
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,273
Former master of Baekdudaegan.

171
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:00,003
By what authority
do you convict us?

172
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:03,112
Listen to this brat.

173
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,312
I'd be watching American TV shows
and having ice cream if not for you.

174
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,883
You're just a nine-tailed
fox stripped of...

175
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,653
your mountain spirit status
for breaking a taboo.

176
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,452
That's why I'm
paying for it now.

177
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,062
Help me!

178
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,332
Help me!

179
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,072
Who are you?

180
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,673
Do you really think you
can hide dressed like that?

181
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:37,812
Who are you?

182
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:39,643
Who are you?

183
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:10,612
You really won't listen.

184
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,562
No.

185
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:46,912
- No.
- Don't look. Please.

186
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:57,963
How foolish.

187
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,362
You should've run away
when you had the time.

188
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,662
I wanted to be a bride.

189
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:08,933
Don't do something stupid like
falling in love in your next time.

190
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,902
I have one last favor to ask.

191
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,142
Please...

192
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,013
remove only the good memories
of me from his memory.

193
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:20,852
Sure.

194
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,723
Listen carefully.

195
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:05,562
Your bride...

196
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,503
Hey. She's not bad.

197
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,572
Hey. Keep it down.
You'll get me in trouble.

198
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,632
You look good.

199
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,672
Do I?

200
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:21,473
How could this happen?

201
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:23,342
How could this happen?

202
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,112
Wait here.

203
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:27,753
What now?

204
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,953
- Hey, this is huge.
- What happened?

205
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:31,322
The wedding in the
next room was canceled.

206
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,753
Really?

207
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:52,473
Who was he again?

208
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,352
Who is he? Do you know him?

209
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:11,293
- No.
- Should I find out?

210
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:14,293
- What?
- How that peaceful wedding...

211
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,862
turned into Pandora's Box.

212
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,533
Who knows? That may be the story
you were destined to cover.

213
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,122
The bride ran away.

214
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,223
She ran away?

215
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,293
Sure, that's possible.

216
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,193
But what kind of an
enlightenment must you obtain...

217
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,362
to make such an expensive
about-face in life?

218
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,062
True love.

219
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:52,402
- Did she have a guy?
- Yes.

220
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,632
He said, "She's my woman."

221
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:58,243
Then the bride grabbed
his hand and said,

222
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:01,312
"I'm going with my love."

223
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,842
All the witnesses
said the same thing.

224
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,453
There's a sign of resistance.

225
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,983
- Isn't that blood?
- There was a scuffle.

226
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:12,582
No one mentioned that.

227
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:13,852
Most importantly,

228
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,892
why is this dress here?

229
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,293
Because she took it off...

230
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,422
You're right. What
did she leave in?

231
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:22,993
The witness statements and
the scene of the incident...

232
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,132
are telling different stories.

233
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:27,372
Were they mass
hypnotized or something?

234
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:31,842
I need to see what that woman
of this love story looks like.

235
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,503
Okay. I'll get a video.

236
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:54,763
It's fox fur.

237
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,963
- Fox?
- A red fox.

238
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,203
A native of Korea.

239
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,072
The native foxes are extinct.

240
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:02,973
Oh my.

241
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,402
There's something you
actually don't know.

242
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:09,842
In 2012, they started a
business reviving foxes.

243
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:12,713
Look.

244
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,083
<font color="#00ff00">EXTINCT FOX SPECIES
REVIVED AFTER 40 YEARS</font>

245
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,582
How was a fox native
to Mount Sobaek...

246
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:19,223
found near here?

247
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:21,822
One was caught in an
apartment complex in Gyeongju,

248
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:23,963
and one even crossed the
DMZ into North Korea.

249
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:26,963
So showing up in a wedding
hall in Gangnam is nothing.

250
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,993
Hungry wild hogs rampage
through convenience stores.

251
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:37,342
All the foxes of Mount
Sobaek have GPS trackers.

252
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:40,142
None of them came to Seoul yet.

253
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,013
I was an assistant director for
an animal show for two years.

254
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:47,382
Okay. So where could
this have come from?

255
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:58,023
Please pick up.

256
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,332
I'm in love with someone.

257
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:10,233
I want to live as a
human being. Please.

258
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,303
A selfie? Now?

259
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:14,572
Nice.

260
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:16,412
Smile.

261
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:18,983
You loved a human once.

262
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:20,612
You understand
how I feel, right?

263
00:23:58,283 --> 00:23:59,422
Here.

264
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:03,092
Thank you.

265
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,822
So Yoon!

266
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,162
Are you an alien?

267
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,973
- No.
- Then what are you?

268
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,602
- A nine-tailed fox.
- Are you over 100 years old?

269
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:21,273
Actually, I'm over 1,000.

270
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,612
What are you doing here though?

271
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:28,553
Nothing other than
waiting for someone.

272
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,513
- As in who?
- My first love.

273
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:31,783
Why?

274
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:37,793
Because a fox can only
love one person...

275
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:39,062
till death.

276
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:42,392
My mom waits for the
delivery man every day.

277
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:44,033
She only has to wait two days.

278
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:49,132
Not for me even after
100 or 1,000 nights.

279
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,943
- How are you coping with that?
- Not well.

280
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:52,703
Then what if I kept you company?

281
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:53,973
- No.
- Why not?

282
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,983
Just look at you. I hate
those with a runny nose.

283
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:03,483
Besides, humans die too early
to properly have a friendship.

284
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,763
I'm saying that life is short,

285
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,433
so try your best in life...

286
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,763
but know to let go when
something's too unbearable.

287
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,062
It extends to people, love,

288
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:22,533
and so on and so forth.

289
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:25,102
- Okay?
- Okay!

290
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:47,162
<font color="#00ff00">AFTERLIFE IMMIGRATION OFFICE</font>

How have you been, Granny?

294
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:39,342
You haven't been around much.

295
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,213
I've been busy, thanks to you.

296
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:45,882
Never did I imagine...

297
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:47,892
seeing the great Taluipa
struggle to operate a computer.

298
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:50,693
What can I do when
the world has changed?

299
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:54,793
The Afterlife should have
a five-day workweek too.

300
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,902
Did you get my text?

301
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:00,562
- About the female fox?
- Why was there no response?

302
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:03,902
Do I seem like someone who has
the time to listen to sob stories?

303
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,473
You're to obey the order and
capture whom you're sent after.

304
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:13,082
Until when must I carry this on?

305
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,483
Have you lost your mind?

306
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:18,483
Did they serve rat poison
at the wedding ceremony?

307
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:19,652
How can one not lose it...

308
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:21,993
after following orders as
a soldier for 600 years?

309
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,293
As a soldier?

310
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,322
Nobody forced you to give up...

311
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:28,933
being a mountain spirit
and live this way.

312
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:30,963
You're the one who
chose this life...

313
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:32,662
in return for that
girl's resurrection.

314
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,543
"I, Lee Yeon, former mountain
spirit of Baekdudaegan,"

315
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,172
"will punish those who
disrupt the order..."

316
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:43,943
"between the Living Realm
and the Afterlife..."

317
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:45,783
"in return for A
Eum's resurrection."

318
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:48,652
Foxes never stay in debt, right?

319
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:49,882
Darn it.

320
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,322
So tell me...

321
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,263
Do you want your freedom back?

322
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,572
You'll end up in the Underworld.

323
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:17,642
- What?
- I'll pray for it every day.

324
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,783
How dare you.

325
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:23,352
And stop munching on
glucosamine tablets.

326
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,852
Having a kind heart is
the key to healthy joints.

What the... Is he
leaving already?

331
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,433
Darling!

332
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:44,973
Have some tteokbokki.

333
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,072
I've lost my appetite
because of that jerk.

334
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:50,812
Goodness, don't be so harsh.

335
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:54,453
Be more considerate of his
heart that awaits a dead woman.

336
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,753
This again? Stop
being such a sap.

337
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,453
You're absolutely clueless
when it comes to love.

338
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,852
I should have the
tteokbokki all by myself.

339
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:07,693
Mr. Lee, why haven't
you been picking up?

340
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,332
- What is it?
- It's a Code Red!

341
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,902
- Tell me what it is.
- Where are you right now?

347
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,092
Are you trying to
pick a fight with me?

348
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:37,253
I committed a mortal sin.

349
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,422
Your attitude says otherwise.

350
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:41,662
- Are they at it again?
- Should we fight it out?

351
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,092
- Yes, let's.
- No, don't.

352
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:45,862
Just stay out of it, sir.

353
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:47,062
I'm back!

354
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,973
- Did you find something?
- I'm not sure.

355
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,703
Is it about the runaway bride?

356
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,473
Bring it over so that
I can see the face.

357
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,412
A red umbrella with an
embroidered pattern?

358
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,342
He has weird taste.

359
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:00,812
I got the footage that
has the best angle of him.

360
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,283
This is him going in...

361
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:03,612
and this is him going out.

362
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:06,953
His face is completely
hidden under the umbrella.

363
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:10,392
Hold on a second. It didn't
rain after the wedding.

364
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,062
Then he's the intelligent type.

365
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,592
I get why he's alone
when he entered,

366
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,503
but why also on the way out?

367
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,263
- She can't be found.
- What?

368
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,473
I checked all the footage
from the wedding hall,

369
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,102
but I couldn't see
the bride leaving it.

370
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:51,632
Have you been listening to me?

371
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,102
- Regarding what?
- That...

372
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,233
That female director
brought over fox fur.

373
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:59,372
- Did you get caught?
- When I'm a seasoned veteran?

374
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:02,213
I'm now up to the point
where I'm wondering...

375
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:03,672
if I've turned into
an actual person.

376
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:04,983
You must be proud.

377
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:07,243
Anyway, I'm getting a bad vibe.

378
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,763
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Somewhat.

379
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:22,332
- Installments?
- A single payment, please.

380
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:29,773
Mr. Lee, there... Over there!

381
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:30,973
What now?

<font color="#00ff00">"UNVEILING URBAN LEGENDS"</font>

383

That's you, right? Oh, no!

384
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,882
Maybe you shouldn't carry around
that umbrella for the time being.

385
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:43,183
This? No.

386
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,253
Tell that human...

387
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,253
to catch me if you can.

388
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,463
- Are you serious?
- What...

<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN

390
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,162
What did I tell you
about that bad vibe?

391
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:00,803
That show's actually
quite famous.

392
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:16,612
- Are you the one with the tip?
- Oh, yes.

393
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,422
I'm the director for
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

394
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:20,582
Could I get an autograph later?

395
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:22,592
I watch each episode
about 20 times, you see.

396
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:23,953
Please have a seat.

397
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:29,993
So you saw him?

398
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,473
- Of course.
- Who is he?

399
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,842
- A monster.
- A monster?

400
00:32:40,973 --> 00:32:43,612
He never ages or dies.

401
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,713
Like goblins and aliens
you see in movies.

402
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:54,592
- I see you don't believe me.
- If I'm being honest, no.

403
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,322
You shouldn't
underestimate me though.

404
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:58,793
I don't lie.

405
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,662
May I ask what you
do for a living?

406
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,862
I'm studying for the state exam.

407
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,733
- And your hometown?
- Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

408
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,102
My mother, who has always
been a farmer, has one wish...

409
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,142
which is to see me work
at a decent office.

410
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,642
Take care, then.

411
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:16,213
I have more to tell you.

412
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,543
Your backstory doesn't
match your shoes.

413
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:21,283
What kind of student can
afford customized shoes...

414
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:23,453
that are worth 4,000 dollars?

415
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:26,053
You don't have an accent from
Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

416
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,953
That already tells me that I
shouldn't be wasting my time.

417
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:30,953
- Bye then.
- Yeou Gogae.

418
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:36,862
"Yeou Gogae"?

419
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,803
That's where I saw him.

420
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:49,013
How can I trust something
coming from an unidentified man?

421
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:52,483
You can check for yourself.

422
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:19,572
Hey, you're back.

423
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,372
Gosh, I picked the
wrong pair of shoes.

424
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,683
She noticed that right away.

425
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,882
But why are you smiling?

426
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:30,152
I like her.

427
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:33,023
What do you like about her?

428
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,553
I like her from head to toe.

429
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,392
Then should we eat her...

430
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:40,162
from head to toe?

431
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:41,963
No, not yet.

432
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:54,913
Which flavor do you want?

433
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:57,942
- Mint chocolate.
- That's all you ever eat.

434
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:02,652
I noticed that you're a
regular, so I gave you a lot.

435
00:35:06,223 --> 00:35:09,692
Next time, just give
me the usual amount.

436
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:11,723
- Pardon?
- When I'm indebted to someone,

437
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,962
I'm obligated to
return the favor.

438
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:34,212
The number you've called
doesn't exist, you punk.

439
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:35,212
Long time no see.

440
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:38,623
- What do you want?
- I just missed you.

441
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:40,353
What are you doing?

442
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:41,453
I'm busy. Hang up.

443
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,353
You don't look very busy.

444
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:48,493
Let's meet.

445
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:50,592
I refuse.

446
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,362
I'll set your house on fire.

447
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:56,033
You're 600 years old.
Stop acting like a kid.

448
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,232
You'll regret it.

449
00:35:57,303 --> 00:35:59,342
- No, I won't.
- Are you still waiting...

450
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,572
for your dead girlfriend?

451
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,942
I heard an interesting rumor.

452
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,813
Should I tell you what it is?

453
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:16,822
Don't try to mess with me.

454
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:18,623
If you want to
know, come meet me.

455
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,612
Tonight, go to the place I told
you about and get on a bus.

456
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:45,922
But I have one condition.

457
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:47,353
What's that?

458
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,752
You must come alone.

Hey, do you direct TV shows?

462
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,522
- Yes.
- My dream is to become a director.

463
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,123
You should become
something else.

464
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,592
I've been working today
for 22 hours straight.

465
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,373

466
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:44,672
Are you okay?

467
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:51,013
Are you going to get
on the bus or not?

468
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:53,183
I'm coming. Just a second.

469
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,453
Get up. Let me take
you to a hospital.

470
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:56,623
Get off me!

471
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,022
Sir, I need to get on this bus.

472
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:01,063

- My gosh.

473
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:03,433
- Are you not coming?
- I'm going. Just a second.

474
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,132
Don't go, you brat!

475
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,402

00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,328
- Sir!
- Don't go, you brat!

479
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,169
It's him.

480
00:38:35,578 --> 00:38:36,779
Wait!

481
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,239
<font color="#00ff00">YEOU GOGAE</font>

482
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,408
Sir, where do you live again?

483
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,578
Just take me to that
tree over there.

484
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:20,919
Sir.

485
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:26,089
You're a lot heavier
than you seem.

486
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:30,058
How strange.

487
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,998
He's so heavy.

488
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,899
I can't even hear him breathing.

489
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:38,868
Sir.

490
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,924
It... It hurts.

491
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:33,288
Please... Your hand...

492
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:40,529
We're here.

493
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:46,169
You should cut down on alcohol.

494
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:48,379
Don't think I'll give
you credit for this.

495
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:50,208
I already paid you back.

496
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:52,779
What?

497
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,359
Sir, wait.

498
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:07,388
Where to?

499
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:08,958
Please follow the route
of bus number 1002.

500
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,839
Sir, did you see the old
man who was behind me?

501
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,609
Who are you talking about?
You're the only person I saw.

502
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,649
Hello? I'd like to
report an accident.

503
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:08,919
Road 144.

504
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,489
Yes, it's Yeou Gogae.

505
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:14,058
"Yeou Gogae"?

506
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:30,178
Road 144, Fox Ridge.

507
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:33,279
My parents are gone.

508
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:39,618
No.

509
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,558
Excuse me.

510
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,808
Excuse me. Wake up.

511
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:06,848
Hey.

512
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,939
Hey.

513
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:00,768
I said no pictures!

514
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,969
You need to stop
them. Seriously.

515
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:06,908
Hey, Ji A. What
are you doing here?

516
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:11,908
Detective Baek. You almost had
to process my corpse today.

517
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,149
What are you talking about?

518
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,819
- I almost got on that bus.
- What?

519
00:44:17,178 --> 00:44:20,319
That was my bus. I was
supposed to be on it.

520
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,449
Are you serious?

521
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:24,118
- 5 are dead, and 1 survived.
- Really?

522
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:26,458
- There should be one more person.
- What?

523
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:28,728
There were seven
people on this bus.

524
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:29,799
Are you sure?

525
00:44:30,228 --> 00:44:31,529
I saw with my own eyes.

526
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:38,908
He's the only one missing.

527
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:41,879
There's no body or anything.

528
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,339
He probably got off.

529
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:46,178
No. This bus didn't stop
before the accident.

530
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:49,719
There's no bus
stop in the tunnel.

531
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:55,319
I need to check
something. Get out.

532
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:57,189
Hurry it up.

533
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:01,728
<font color="#00ff00">"DEATH TRAP ROAD 144!
ONLY 1 OUT OF 6 SURVIVED"</font>

534
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:04,658
"Only 1 out of 6 survived."

535
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:10,899
- Let's go.
- Too many people died.

536
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,339
- So?
- Just leave it.

537
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,638
I have to finish it by myself.

538
00:45:19,588 --> 00:45:21,048
<font color="#00ff00">JUNG SOO YOUNG</font>

539
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:30,689
Soo Young. Do you recognize me?

540
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,288
We met at the bus stop.

541
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:39,529
Do you remember how
the accident occurred?

542
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:52,348
You must be scared because you
were the only one who survived.

543
00:45:54,348 --> 00:45:57,348
I was in a similar
accident a long time ago.

544
00:45:58,149 --> 00:45:59,489
That's why I'm all alone.

545
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:02,658
If you put your mind to it,

546
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:06,129
a tragedy can become a
very convenient shield.

547
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,458
Because everyone fusses over you
and pours out their sympathy.

548
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:13,399
But I hope you'll become strong.

549
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:18,439
It's much more fun being a
production director than a victim.

550
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,199
Contact me if you need anything.

551
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:51,768
Did you see that young man
who sat by the window...

552
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:52,969
on the right side of the bus?

553
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:56,638
He had an umbrella like this.

554
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:06,388
You did see him.

555
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:09,958
What did you see? What
was it, that you're so...

556
00:47:10,618 --> 00:47:11,759
He's coming.

557
00:47:12,828 --> 00:47:13,888
What?

558
00:47:14,288 --> 00:47:15,498
He's coming to kill me.

559
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:18,558
He'll come to kill me too.

560
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:26,569
Jae Hwan. Tell Detective Baek to
send some people to the hospital.

561
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,708
Yes. What about the
camera from the bus?

562
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:30,779
It's blank.

563
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:33,879
It's the same as
the wedding hall.

564
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,449
- What about on the road?
- There aren't any at all.

565
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,328
I'm looking for the teenage
girl who was admitted...

566
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:50,199
after the bus
accident yesterday.

567
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,098
Are you together?

568
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:54,469
What?

569
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,748
Found him.

570
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:18,028
<font color="#00ff00">WOOJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL</font>

571
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:20,428
Why does a TV station's production
director want to see me?

572
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,198
This voice. It couldn't be.

573
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:26,499
Why do you think?

574
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,899
Are you scouting me
to become an idol?

575
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:33,368
But sorry, I can't
sing or dance.

576
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:37,408
My only talent is my face.

577
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:41,078
Yes, I'm scouting
you, but not for that.

578
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:43,649
- Then?
- Fox Ridge.

579
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:47,118
Is it a horror movie?

580
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:49,589
It's an urban legend.

581
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:53,888
For example, 1 passenger on
the 1002 bus disappeared.

582
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:55,558
Like he evaporated
into thin air.

583
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:58,258
It doesn't sound like
it'll be very well-made.

584
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:00,629
Plus, I'm more into rom-com.

585
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,308
What about this?

586
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:13,448
That color photographs
really well.

587
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,678
I don't know if it's
a coincidence or fate,

588
00:49:17,678 --> 00:49:19,519
but I saw you three
times already.

589
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:23,558
First, it was in a wedding hall
in which a bride disappeared.

590
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:25,089
Second, on the 1002 bus.

591
00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:29,229
Third, at this hospital where
I came to meet the victim.

592
00:49:34,198 --> 00:49:35,638
Let's say it was fate.

593
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:38,868
But sorry to disappoint.
I'm seeing someone.

594
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:40,738
Plus, I'm very devoted.

595
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:44,008
Did you kill them?

596
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,718
Or did you come to kill her?

597
00:49:56,689 --> 00:50:00,289
I met someone that I
want to kill. Just now.

598
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:15,439
Where is he? He said he'd
be back in 10 minutes.

599
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:20,508
Don't people usually have
evidence to back them up...

600
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:22,149
when they ask rude
questions like that?

601
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,118
Like physical
proof or witnesses.

602
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:27,988
Or at least a police badge.

603
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:32,359
You're right. I was very
rude, wasn't I? I'm sorry.

604
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,758
I don't need your empty apology.

605
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:38,399
You didn't touch your coffee.

606
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:40,968
Have some.

607
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:43,868
I don't eat or drink
anything from strangers.

608
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:45,638
It's such a dangerous world.

609
00:50:47,808 --> 00:50:48,908
One more thing.

610
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:50,979
What now?

611
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:53,008
- What's your name?
- Who knows?

612
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:54,879
Why don't you try to find out?

613
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:57,479
Wait.

614
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,448
At least take my business card.

615
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:02,888
It's inside.

616
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:08,129
What is this, a blind date?

617
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:10,499
I don't want a second date.

618
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:26,109
Hey, Jae Hwan. Ask Detective
Baek to run a fingerprint for me.

619
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,278
Yes.

620
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:33,289
A leather bag.

621
00:51:35,388 --> 00:51:36,988
This is totally fate.

622
00:51:37,058 --> 00:51:40,589
The little girl whose life you
saved 20-plus years ago showed up.

623
00:51:41,089 --> 00:51:42,999
She must not even remember.

624
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:44,459
I don't like it.

625
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:45,698
She really does look like her.

626
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:48,129
I get surprised every
time I see her too.

627
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:50,269
You should quit consulting
for that TV station.

628
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:53,408
No. That's directly
related to my livelihood.

629
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:54,968
It's just a B-rated program.

630
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:58,408
It's the only show you enjoy.
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

631
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,948
You even posted a comment
on their website...

632
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,178
that the Grim Reaper's
outfit was all wrong.

633
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:05,078
I know Grim Reapers well...

634
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:06,888
Concentrate on driving.

635
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:51,428
Soo Young, are you all right?

636
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:55,028
I told you to keep
an eye on her.

637
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:56,899
I only left the room
for about five minutes.

638
00:52:57,698 --> 00:53:00,308
- Did you catch the guy?
- No one saw even a shadow.

639
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:02,269
Maybe she's just dreaming.

640
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:04,109
I'm not!

641
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:06,808
Ji A, I don't want to stay here.

642
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,078
I must leave.

643
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:11,019
Soo Young.

644
00:53:14,118 --> 00:53:15,419
If I stay,

645
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:17,888
I'll die.

646
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:27,729
<font color="#00ff00">MISSING PARENTS</font>

647

648
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:47,718
I don't if my clothes will fit.

649
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:50,189
I'm sorry for putting
you out like this.

650
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,718
It's only for the night.

651
00:53:51,888 --> 00:53:54,158
What about your family?

652
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,899
I live alone, so make
yourself at home.

653
00:54:08,138 --> 00:54:09,278
She's all alone.

654
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:21,705
When did she get discharged?

655
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,074
It hasn't been long.

656
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:26,114
She asked me to
give this to you.

657
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:29,145
- Who...
- The lady who took the patient.

658
00:54:58,515 --> 00:54:59,614
Soo Young?

659
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:02,654
Why aren't you in bed?

660
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:04,154
I suddenly remembered...

661
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,424
what happened in
the tunnel that day.

662
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:22,904
The bus entered the tunnel.

663
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:26,875
I took out my earphones...

664
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:31,174
only to be met with silence.

665
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:04,674
Do you want...

666
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,384
Everyone was dead.

667
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:14,384
From the darkness,

668
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:18,254
he began to approach me.

669
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,625
He?

670
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,364
The man with the umbrella.

671
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,205
What did that man do?

672
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,134
He tried to kill me!

673
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:36,714
I was terrified.

674
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:47,324
It's all right.
It'll be all fine.

675
00:56:49,995 --> 00:56:52,194
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

676
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:53,625
- Lift up your feet.
- I'm good.

677
00:56:56,265 --> 00:57:00,234
Soo Young, where were you headed
in the middle of the night?

678
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:03,475
What? Home, of course...

679
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:06,904
I checked your address
and in order to do so,

680
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:09,274
you had to be going
the other way.

681
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:11,745
You see, that night...

682
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:14,884
Stop blabbering
whatever comes to mind.

683
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,085
Ji A...

684
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:30,335
When did you figure it out?

685
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:35,665
Humans...

686
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:37,634
instinctively move to
protect themselves...

687
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:40,145
when involved in car accidents.

688
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,915
However, the sole survivor
of that bus crash...

689
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:46,614
had no defensive wounds.

690
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:56,895
I don't believe in
miracles, you see.

691
00:57:58,594 --> 00:57:59,795
Who are you?

692
00:58:03,464 --> 00:58:05,364
I'm someone you know...

693
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:09,105
and also someone you don't.

694
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:12,804
How...

695
00:58:15,844 --> 00:58:16,915
Where's the real Soo Young?

696
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:18,214
I ate her.

697
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:30,855
As if something like
this could hurt me.

698
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:33,694
I know.

699
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,694
I only offered myself as bait.

700
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:39,665
Bait?

701
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:45,574
Hey, you. Didn't I reject
your proposal earlier?

702
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:48,574
What you're looking for
will be at my house.

703
00:58:49,174 --> 00:58:50,515
Shouldn't you get busy?

704
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:05,054
- Did you miss me?
- As if, brother.

705
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:07,265
- Brother?
- It's a long story,

706
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:09,065
but the family has a dirty past.

707
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:23,774
This is why kids
must be disciplined.

708
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,475
How many people have you killed?

709
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:54,174
Are you worried I'll be
sucked into the Underworld?

710
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:56,515
No, it's because
you embarrass me.

711
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,475
This is because I don't want
a pathetic life like yours.

712
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:02,114
What's more pathetic is
a grown man who whines.

713
01:00:10,725 --> 01:00:13,225
Time out. How about
a bet instead?

714
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,765
Old habits really do die hard.

715
01:00:15,765 --> 01:00:17,795
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

716
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:19,835
this woman will die.

717
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:25,504
- What?
- You know I'm not joking.

718
01:00:29,145 --> 01:00:30,274
I'll see you around.

719
01:00:47,495 --> 01:00:49,694
You... Who on earth
are you people?

720
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:56,774
Forget everything about me.

721
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:09,952
<font color="#00ff00">DETECTIVE BAEK</font>

722
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:17,194
I got the result back on the
fingerprint you wanted an ID on.

723
01:01:22,964 --> 01:01:25,134
As if something like
this could hurt me.

724
01:01:26,705 --> 01:01:29,734
I only offered myself as bait.

725
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:31,274
Bait?

726
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:32,875
Shin Ju, is that you?

727
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:36,174
Why are all the doors open?

728
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:38,214
Did you miss me?

729
01:01:38,214 --> 01:01:39,714
- As if, brother.
- Brother?

730
01:01:39,714 --> 01:01:42,285
It's a long story, but the
family has a dirty past.

731
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:43,415
What's going on?

732
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:47,355
This is why kids
must be disciplined.

733
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:57,364
How many people have you killed?

734
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,094
Are you worried I'll be
sucked into the Underworld?

735
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:00,935
No, it's because
you embarrass me.

736
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:03,975
This is because I don't want
a pathetic life like yours.

737
01:02:04,074 --> 01:02:06,674
What's more pathetic is
a grown man who whines.

738
01:02:20,355 --> 01:02:21,524
Do you like it?

739
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:24,455
How did you come here?

740
01:02:26,495 --> 01:02:28,924
Name. Lee Yeon.
Age. 36 years old.

741
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:31,134
It's pretty obvious that you
live with a fake identity.

742
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:34,004
Now, I can proudly
say that it's fate.

743
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:37,205
You remember what happened?

744
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:39,975
I don't know what it is, but
I guess it didn't work on me.

745
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:42,705
What do you want?

746
01:02:43,674 --> 01:02:44,844
The original copy is in here.

747
01:02:45,274 --> 01:02:46,714
If you want it,
come and take it.

748
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:45,004
I knew it. You're not human.

749
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:49,274
Did you just test me?

750
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:00,585
Forget everything you saw today.

751
01:04:01,054 --> 01:04:02,484
If you don't,

752
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:07,824
I'll kill you.

753
01:04:10,435 --> 01:04:13,504
I've been waiting for you.

<font color="#00ff00"><b>TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</b></font>
