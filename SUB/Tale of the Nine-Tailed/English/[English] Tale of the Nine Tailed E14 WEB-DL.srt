Yeon.

8
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,060
Yes, it's me.

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,170
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,140
As I was entering the room,

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,410
I could feel myself losing control of my body.

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,940
It's all right. You did good.

13
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,720
I can still feel...

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,120
how it swarmed inside my head.

15
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,390
Let's hurry.

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,630
At least so I can be myself...

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,770
right before it all ends.

18
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,140
I want to be there beside you.

19
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,980
Let's end this.

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,480
Let's put an end...

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,190
to this exhausting fight.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,920
Are you okay?

23
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,630
Drive.

24
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,170
Why?

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,970
- Why are you doing this? - What?

26
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,540
Is it fun to bring chaos to the world?

27
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,210
Is that what motivates you?

28
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,710
No.

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,250
Truth be told, I actually prefer reading books.

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,910
Then why are you doing this?

31
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,850
Because I want Lee Yeon dead.

32
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,420
And you think he'll easily cave in?

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,550
That's why I'm doing this.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
He won't stop his fight against me.

35
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,090
He keeps trying to defy destiny.

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,630
There's no turning back now.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,140
We've both crossed the line, you see.

38
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,510
Mr. Lee!

39
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,150
Did you get hurt?

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,220
Not really.

41
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,750
Well, you're about to.

42
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,120
How dare you fool me.

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,160
- This was the only way. - Shut it.

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,660
It was pretty obvious...

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,160
when he gathered us all for the meeting.

46
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,530
As if you knew.

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,000
He wouldn't have blabbed about the Sin Slayer...

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,470
had he found the real one.

49
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,670
He would've bulldozed over and slayed her.

50
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,700
What?

51
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,570
I'm saying that he's a man of action,

52
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,070
not words.

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,010
So were you able to get your answer?

54
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,550
I guess.

55
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,050
And what would that be?

56
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,480
- A key. - A key to what?

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,250
The one Imoogi needs to jump from body to body.

58
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,460
Do we have a way to drag it out of Ms. Nam then?

59
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,790
I can't be satisfied with that.

60
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
What?

61
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,130
My plan is to keep it buried forever...

62
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,740
so that it never resurfaces.

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Stop right there.

64
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,340
You heard me!

65
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,440
The moment you step past those doors,

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,910
you'll lose everything.

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,410
I'll make sure of it!

68
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,560
And what is it do I have to lose?

69
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,130
The Gatekeeper of Samdo River,

70
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,800
powers that nearly match an Almighty,

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,870
and an immortal life. I gave you all of that!

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,210
What I want though aren't those.

73
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,810
It's my wife and son.

74
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,850
Honey, but living with you forever now...

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,020
is my biggest punishment of all.

76
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,160
Stop right there.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,190
I told you to stop!

("Unveiling Urban Legends")

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,460
- Mr. Choi. - What?

80
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,860
Did anything happen in our absence?

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,290
Are you all right?

82
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,260
What did Mr. Choi say?

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,130
A police officer passed away.

84
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,030
- Cause of death? - He says it was a heart attack,

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,810
but Mr. Choi noticed odd spots on his body while performing CPR.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,140
Also, he spit out an egg.

87
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,640
An egg?

88
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,080
Are they still with your boss?

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,550
Where are you right now?

90
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,990
So much for peace and quiet in my latter years.

91
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,360
Never did I think I'd see a man...

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,460
- die before my eyes. - Mr. Choi...

93
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,760
Guys, get away from him right now.

94
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,100
Got it.

95
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,970
Mr. Choi was at the police station?

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,740
Yes, he performed CPR on the victim.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,510
Nothing happened though, right?

98
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,250
Not yet, it hasn't.

There's a rapid increase in the number of victim's dying.

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,830
I need to get going.

Where are you headed?

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,170
Head home first.

105
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,470
Don't go there alone and let them take you.

106

You must hurry, Yeon.

107

My wife will soon alter Ji A's date of death on the list.

What's wrong?

109
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,710
It's just like he warned me.

110
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,110
What do you mean?

111
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,910
He told me he'll spread a virus...

112
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,050
and kill everyone that's precious to me.

113
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,220
Wait. My parents.

114
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,890
I'll go check up on them. You should go and wait for Mr. Lee.

115
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,650
- But... - Don't worry.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,860
Mr. Lee Rang, please take her home.

117
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,300
Ask me politely to take you home.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
I'd rather die than do that.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Then just die.

120
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,570
I won't be there to help you when Imoogi comes for you.

121
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,110
To me, you're no different from him.

122
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,450
Doesn't that apply to you?

123
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,810
You're the female Imoogi.

124
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,520
- Let's just go our own ways. - As you wish.

125
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,230
She's so stubborn.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,870
I really don't get what Yeon likes about her.

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,490
What? What's wrong with this?

128
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,400
Wait. You dropped...

129
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,640
Mr. Hyeonuiong?

130
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,810
Fortunately,

131
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,610
I got here on time.

132
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,120
Are you sure you didn't get hurt?

133
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm okay.

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,690
The gatekeeper of Samdo River is involved in this?

135
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,830
Thank goodness.

136
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,570
It looks like something big is about to happen soon.

137
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,160
- Granny. - Choose your words wisely.

138
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm in a very bad mood just as much as you are.

139
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,430
You messed with the list?

140
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,640
You turned your back on me...

141
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,340
and did something you won't even be able to forgive yourself for?

142
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,510
You really chose to do that?

143
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,950
No matter what you say, I won't withdraw what I wrote.

144
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,920
That is...

145
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,380
my choice.

146
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Why not just kill the guy who spread the plague? Why Ji A?

147
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,390
You already know you can't kill him with a sword.

148
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,200
I see the blade won't kill you.

149
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,340
The problem is what lives inside the girl's body.

150
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,040
We need to destroy that in order to destroy the other one.

151
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,140
And to do that,

152
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,480
she needs to die.

153
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,190
I'm only going to say this once.

154
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,220
Return things...

155
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,390
back to how they were.

156
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,860
This is how it should be.

157
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,200
That's the only way it'll end.

158
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,300
No.

159
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,040
I won't let anyone...

160
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,410
take Ji A away.

161
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,220
And that includes you.

162
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,750
It's out of your hands now.

163
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,240
Go ahead.

164
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,620
Are you saying accidents like earlier...

165
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,390
will keep happening until I die?

166
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,900
I'm glad I got to see my parents one last time.

167
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,170
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,840
Why are you sorry?

169
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,270
You saved my life.

170
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,180
I tried my best to stop this.

171
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,680
But this is all I can do.

172
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,690
What about Yeon?

173
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
He went to settle things with my wife.

174
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,030
- Will he be okay? - I don't know.

175
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,170
Once my wife is convinced that she is right,

176
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,400
she never changes her mind.

177
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,770
And Yeon knows that.

178
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,340
Then could he get hurt...

179
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,580
because of me?

180
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,710
He's probably willing to risk everything he has right now.

181
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,330
You can use this to take my life.

182
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Just give me three more days.

183
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,430
If I don't catch him within three days,

184
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,410
then just kill me with this.

185
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,940
I can't do that.

186
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,010
He's already out of control.

187
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,690
- I have his scale. - It's too late.

188
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,920
I can catch him! I can catch Imoogi!

189
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,430
How many more lives do you think he'll take within those three days?

190
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,030
Their lives are just as important as the life you wish to save.

191
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,150
Please don't do this.

192
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,660
Please don't kill Ji A.

193
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,260
I'll do anything.

194
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,170
- I'll do anything you ask. - Just fight me instead.

195
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,870
Cut the nonsense and just fight me like you'd normally do.

196
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,470
Please.

197
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,510
Get up.

198
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,150
I wouldn't have started this if I was going to change my mind.

199
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,490
How could you do this to me?

200
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,820
I've already lost my child and husband, so I can do much worse.

201
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,230
Even if that means I'll end up losing you.

202
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,740
You'll regret this,

203
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,170
Granny.

204
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,950
Where did it all go wrong?

205
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,520
If it weren't for me, Yeon would still be...

206
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,760
living as a mountain spirit.

207
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,060
No.

208
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,570
I never should've been born.

209
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,100
Listen. It's not your fault.

210
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,810
Don't hate yourself...

211
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,710
and deny the connection you have with him.

212
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,140
I feel like it's all my fault.

213
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,780
We may be immortal, but we're just like humans.

214
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,380
Our happy and precious memories are what keeps us going.

215
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,990
For me, it's the memory of my son.

216
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,690
For the Snail Bride, it's the memory of her sweet husband.

217
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,060
And Yeon managed to keep living thanks to you.

218
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,600
Imoogi told me...

219
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,100
that I'll eventually end up killing Yeon...

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,140
with my own two hands.

221
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,300
That's why...

222
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,910
both you and Yeon are trying so hard...

223
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,540
to protect each other.

224
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,520
I'm surrounded by dead ends.

225
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,200
Darn it. It won't light.

226
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,770
I thought you were quitting.

227
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,240
I've tried all sorts of things to quit.

228
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,480
I chewed on mints, stuck on patches, tried gums,

229
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,080
and even prescription medicine.

230
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,390
I tried all of that, but I still couldn't quit.

231
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,190
What are you talking about?

232
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,590
What if, no matter how hard you try,

233
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,960
the ending will stay the same?

234
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,970
If only one of you can survive, either you or the girl.

235
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,540
The ending...

236
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,140
won't change. I see.

237
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,810
Want me to blow on it?

238
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,610
- Are you kidding me? - Or do you want my car?

239
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,410
Why do I bother?

240
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,610
And hey, kid. Do something about your runny nose when you're with me.

241
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,250
I have a weak stomach.

242
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,660
How long have you been wearing that? Did you even wash it?

243
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,040
Buy some clothes at a department store.

244
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,210
I'm very sensitive regarding hygiene.

245
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,010
I'm going to the bathroom.

246
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,420
What are all these stickers?

247
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,320
You're dead when I come out!

248
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,960
What a nice day.

249
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,530
It's gorgeous out.

250
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Your coffee.

251
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,330
This tree grew a lot.

252
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,800
It did. It grew nicely.

253
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,640
What are you thinking about?

254
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,750
Where were we...

255
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,950
while this much time passed?

256
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Right? They say we were missing for years.

257
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,950
It feels strange, doesn't it?

258
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,160
All I know is that we were asleep the whole time.

259
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,090
It's odd that we don't have any pressure ulcers on our bodies.

260
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,130
And it's odd how nervous Ji A is too.

261
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,670
It reminds me of "Io Island".

262
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,630
"Io Island"?

263
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You know, a fisherman accidentally ends up on a fantasy island,

264
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,080
and when he leaves, he realizes 100 years had passed.

265
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,710
Ji A grew really well, just like that tree,

266
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,920
so I'm grateful.

267
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,840
Is this all we're eating?

268
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,010
It's good.

269
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,680
I want naengmyeon.

270
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Yu Ri.

271
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,750
When is she coming?

272
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,520
I'm wondering...

273
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,150
when would be good.

274
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,820
Why are you only thinking?

275
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,920
Because once I finish thinking,

276
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,490
Yeon will lose something.

277
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,430
It has been over 600 years.

278
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,400
I plan to end this fight once and for all.

279
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,870
What if you fail?

280
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,870
Rang.

281
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,670
That's why I need you.

282
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,440
If by chance something happens to me,

283
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,310
I'd like you to finish this yourself.

284
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,920
I'd like you to be my final weapon.

285
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,790
I refuse.

286
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,890
Whether Imoogi destroys the world...

287
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,960
or kills your woman, I don't care.

288
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,200
We want to protect different things.

289
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,400
- Rang. - You protect her.

290
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,540
I'll free Yu Ri...

291
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,340
and save you.

292
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,180
Why are you smiling?

293
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,920
I feel like being a good boy really isn't my thing.

294
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Later.

295
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,100
Watch the apartment, Geomdoong.

296
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,500
Why am I Geomdoong?

297
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,910
Shi Young.

298
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,770
Oh, my. Hello.

299
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,940
What brings you here at this hour?

300
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,080
Well... I wanted to have a bowl of samgyetang.

301
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,020
But... You're not sick or anything, right?

302
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,890
Of course, not.

303
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,790
I do 200 squats a day.

304
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,030
Do you want to see?

305
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,130
Goodness.

306
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,430
- Have a seat. - Okay.

307
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,430
Serve him.

308
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,570
Seven cops were taken to the hospital this morning.

309
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,470
What about Mr. Choi?

310
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,340
You saw him. He was fine.

311
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,840
I told him to see a doctor anyway, but he won't listen.

312
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,150
If he's okay, we should be okay too, right?

313
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,750
Let's worry about editing. Walk faster.

314
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,960
You must be busy prepping for the day.

315
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,360
I felt a weird taste in my mouth. I feel so much better now.

316
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,000
What's wrong?

317
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
You don't look well.

318
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,340
Do I have a fever?

319
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,210
Not at all. You're so cold.

320
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,780
Give me your hand. Your hand's cold too.

321
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,420
How could your body temperature drop this much?

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,100
It's a snake egg.

323
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,840
He's sleeping again. Wake up.

324
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,910
Excuse me. Wake up.

325
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,810
Sir?

326
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,890
What happened?

327
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,160
He... He's dead.

328
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,560
Hey. Call an ambulance. I'll go get help.

329
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,270
What?

330
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,730
They died?

331
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,200
Everyone on our floor?

332
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,170
Hold on.

333
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,780
Breaking news. People are dying from unknown causes...

334
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,910
in masses.

335
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,020
The first of such deaths occurred only two days ago.

336
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,220
It is presumed to be a highly lethal,

337
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,260
highly contagious disease.

338
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,590
All of the victims had red spots...

339
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,960
all over their bodies.

340
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,230
According to the autopsy report of the first victim,

341
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,530
his organs showed signs of fatal injuries...

342
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,540
as if attacked by a wild animal.

343
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,140
Kim, a man in his 30s,

344
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,070
had no underlying illness...

345
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,290
- How is it? - It's lame.

346
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,990
It's not my style.

347
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,060
So it's normal.

348
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Where are you going now?

349
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,070
I want to get some free tea.

350
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,630
I'll grant you a visit to commemorate.

351
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,270
- A visit? - With your boyfriend.

352
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,370
Go see him.

353
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,290
Yu... Yu Ri. Are you okay?

354
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,760
Let's meet up right now.

355
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,290
Right now?

356
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
Where?

357
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,870
I'll come to you.

358
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,560
Come out.

359
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,130
I know you're hiding inside of me.

360
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,160
Come out!

361
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,830
Show yourself by the count of three, or...

362
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,340
I'll kill myself.

363
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,640
One, two,

364
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,010
three.

365
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,420
Crazy wench.

366
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,660
You dare to summon me when you're merely a shell?

367
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,270
A shell?

368
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,900
That's rich coming from a squatter...

369
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,600
who's staying rent-free.

370
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,470
Well, your body will completely be mine soon.

371
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,210
I'll give it a day or so.

372
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,110
Soon, I'll be in full control of your body.

373
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,880
That's slower than I thought.

374
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,780
Why?

375
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,950
It's been a while since I lost the fox bead.

376
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,250
Call it the aftermath.

377
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,660
I've been bound by it for too long.

378
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,430
Anyway, say your goodbyes when you can.

379
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,800
Once I take control of your body,

380
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,130
you'll be the one who falls asleep in it...

381
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,230
forever.

382
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,270
In other words, you're not in a stable state...

383
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,870
until that happens.

384
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,750
Darn. What can you possibly do about it though?

385
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,850
What if I die before you take control?

386
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,620
You'll never be able to.

387
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,050
You see,

388
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,320
people can do just about anything to save those they love...

389
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,300
like going absolutely crazy.

390
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,530
Help!

391
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,400
- What's wrong with him? - Sir!

392
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,570
Please help. What's happening?

393
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,640
My gosh.

394
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,840
Somebody help. Call an ambulance!

395
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,710
Can anybody help me?

396
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,320
You psycho.

397
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,420
That'll be all.

398
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,920
You can go back to sleep now.

399
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,790
That's all I wanted to confirm.

400
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,230
Listen, you woman. Lee Yeon will perish because of you.

401
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,900
For he won't be able to give up on you.

402
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,540
Rather than worrying about my love life,

403
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,610
I advise you to worry more about your partner.

404
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,610
Being rejected must've hit him hard...

405
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,220
because he's planning to take us both with him to the Underworld.

406
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,180
That's absurd.

407
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,790
My date of death has been altered.

408
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,390
Do you really believe he had no idea...

409
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,230
that Taluipa would go to such lengths...

410
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,060
to stop him from slaughtering innocent lives?

411
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,160
Are you in here?

412
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes, I'll be right out.

413
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,480
Yu Ri!

414
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,250
Are you hurt? Let me see.

415
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,350
I'm fine.

416
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,020
I'm glad.

417
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,290
I was worried sick about you.

418
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,300
How are you here though? Did you manage to escape?

419
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,630
Why didn't you tell me that Imoogi was behind this?

420
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,770
- And Mr. Lee? - He's alive and well.

421
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,470
He never expresses it, but he's worried sick about you too.

422
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,840
I'm glad.

423
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,810
Let's go. He'll be thrilled to know...

424
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,320
- that you're back... - I can't.

425
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,750
What?

426
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,950
I can't go.

427
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,060
I can't and you can't either.

428
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,290
What are you talking about?

429
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,260
I'm keeping you here so that you can't go.

430
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,700
What on earth...

431
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,710
No.

432
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,840
Let me go.

433
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,310
I said we both can't go.

434
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,290
I'll grant you a visit to commemorate.

435
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,820
With your boyfriend. Go see him.

436
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,260
Why must I do as you say?

437
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,830
Because if I lay my eyes on Shin Ju today,

438
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,870
he'll die.

439
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,250
- Hey, Dad. - My daughter.

440
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,020
- Where are you? - Out, of course.

441
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,460
- Why do you ask? - A friend of yours came by.

442
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
A friend? Who?

443
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,430
I told you not to open the door for anyone.

444
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,600
Well, it was a face we recognized.

445
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,100
Who can you possibly know?

446
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,370
- Yeon? - No.

447
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,280
That young man with a fair complexion.

448
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,010
The carnation.

449
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,380
What?

450
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,290
I told you that I won't be as nice to you anymore.

451
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,860
You'll pay if you lay a finger on them...

452
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,290
Don't defy your destiny.

453
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,730
I can shatter everything you cherish.

454
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,170
Who are you? You're not Ji A's friend, are you?

455
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,870
No, Mom. Don't!

456
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,810
"I wish to hang myself."

457
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,680
No!

458
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,720
"I wish to hang myself."

459
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,850
No!

460
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,260
You can't leave.

461
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,360
No, I must go.

462
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,660
My mom and dad are in danger. Please...

463
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh, no.

464
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,750
Sleep.

465
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,430
How did you know I was here?

466
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,430
I'm coming back from Samdo River.

467
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,430
The old lady with the Clairvoyance?

468
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,940
She changed the date of Ji A's death...

469
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,610
thanks to you spreading the plague.

470
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,710
But she's still alive.

471
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,910
I just talked to her on the phone.

472
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,580
Hyeonuiong's protecting her in my absence.

473
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,480
Although, I doubt he'll be able to last.

474
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,720
You said you're coming from Samdo River.

475
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,950
Why didn't you beg the old lady for mercy?

476
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,820
That I already did.

477
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
So it didn't work.

478
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,930
If Ji A dies, the other half of you will perish too.

479
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,600
So?

480
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,510
What is it that you truly want?

481
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,070
Take a guess.

482
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,740
You exist to lack love.

483
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,210
Even as a human and even now.

484
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,380
The Almighty created a being...

485
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,790
that gets the short straw on everything.

486
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,850
That's you, Imoogi.

487
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,430
Is a war what you want?

488
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,000
No, the opposite, actually.

489
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,870
- What? - What if there was something...

490
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,500
other than your obsession with me and Ji A...

491
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,140
that can satisfy you?

492
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,810
What if you were given a chance to obtain a position not allowed...

493
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
to even lower-class mountain spirit?

494
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,210
Enough with the cryptic talk.

495
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,980
The highest of all spirits.

496
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
No way.

497
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,660
The gatekeeper of Samdo River.

498
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,370
Let's join hands and kill the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

499
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,840
How interesting. This is quite unexpected.

500
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,480
I had no idea you'd think of betraying that old woman.

501
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,110
I'll do anything to save Ji A.

502
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,750
So...

503
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,880
you're going to hold hands with me?

504
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Of course. Even if that means I need to get my hands dirty with you.

505
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
And what's the condition?

506
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,030
Let Ji A go.

507
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,000
Get rid of your other half from her body once and for all.

508
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,030
And don't ever look for us again.

509
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,130
That's all I want.

510
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,740
If you were in my shoes, would you not think that it could be a trap?

511
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,970
No, I wouldn't.

512
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,040
What?

513
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,990
Then try and guess...

514
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,720
what my answer is going to be.

515
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,190
You'd probably love to say no.

516
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,660
But you'll eventually accept my offer.

517
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,470
Where does that confidence come from?

518
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,670
Because we're both at a dead end.

519
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,580
If you reject my offer, you'll lose your other half.

520
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,780
And I'll lose Ji A.

521
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,190
In the end, we'll fight like crazy and end up in the Underworld.

522
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,920
That's what I've been waiting for after I had my last date with her.

523
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,460
Let me know if you change your mind.

524
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,600
You have until the sun rises tomorrow morning.

525
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,780
You knew Imoogi went there to kill them,

526
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,820
but you still kept me here? Why?

527
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,220
Did he threaten you?

528
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,430
Or is he manipulating you just like how he made you stab Mr. Lee Rang?

529
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,000
- It's neither. - Then why?

530
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,030
Why did you do that?

531
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,100
Who cares what happens to those useless humans?

532
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,110
"Useless humans"?

533
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,150
I thought you came to see me.

534
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,150
I was worried about you like crazy!

535
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,090
But...

536
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,960
you just used me as bait.

537
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
You used my feelings for you.

538
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,560
- Shin Ju. - Stop.

539
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,800
If you say one more word,

540
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,940
I might actually regret liking you, Yu Ri.

541
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,130
I bet you were really worried. They're both okay.

542
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,100
I erased their memories.

543
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,910
Your parents won't remember meeting Imoogi.

544
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,980
Thank you, Yeon.

545
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,280
It's my fault. I shouldn't have left them alone.

546
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
It wasn't your fault.

547
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,890
I know you're always there to protect them.

548
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,700
Thank you for saving Ji A while I was gone.

549
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,730
What's your plan?

550
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm going to join hands with Imoogi.

551
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,600
- What? - What do you mean?

552
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,440
Is it because of my wife?

553
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,170
Yes.

554
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,780
I guess my wife...

555
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,250
decided to give up on you.

556
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,650
She gave me a chance to fight one more time.

557
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
Be more specific.

558
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,150
I got myself two more days.

559
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,990
And you'll be fine.

560
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,790
Does that mean I'll be...

561
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,130
Yes, of course. I won't let you die.

562
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,200
Not on my watch.

563
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,900
Then what about joining hands with Imoogi?

564
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,640
It's obviously a trap.

565
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,240
I knew it.

566
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,510
What did my wife ask in return?

567
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,680
Nothing. She just asked me to catch him no matter what.

568
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,780
- Yeon. - Next time.

569
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,680
I'll tell you the details next time.

570
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,420
I want to go eat with Ji A.

571
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,120
I'll go get changed.

572
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,520
What if, no matter how hard you try,

573
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,020
the ending will stay the same?

574
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,760
If only one of you can survive, either you or the girl.

575
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,560
The ending...

576
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,160
won't change. I see.

577
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,420
Then there's nothing more to worry about.

578
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,090
What do you plan to do?

579
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,660
I'll eat this.

580
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,130
I'll have the Imoogi inside Ji A enter my body instead.

581
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,270
And along with the other half, I'll jump...

582
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,970
into Samdo River.

583
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,540
So that he won't ever be able to resurrect again.

584
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,350
- If you jump into Samdo River... - Yes, I know.

585
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,450
I'll never get a chance to be reborn again.

586
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,780
I also know...

587
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,820
that I won't ever be able to go back to Ji A.

588
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,530
I'm sorry for troubling you.

589
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,230
You could've taken me to a hospital.

590
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,100
It's useless to go there.

591
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,070
This isn't a normal kind of illness, you see.

592
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,640
It's cold.

593
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,710
Hang in there.

594
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,020
This nasty fight...

595
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,920
will soon end.

596
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,290
Make sure you hang in there until then.

597
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,660
I guess I was right. You're not...

598
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
an ordinary woman, are you?

599
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,570
My goodness, Hyeonuiong.

600
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,550
I was wondering why you weren't at the restaurant.

601
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,250
I'm sorry...

602
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,720
My goodness.

603
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,090
Come see me outside.

604
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,830
Do you even know who he is?

605
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,970
What are you talking about?

606
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,500
He's your husband.

607
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,640
- What? - He's the husband...

608
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,570
from your past life, the man you missed so dearly.

609
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,950
Is anyone there? Hey!

610
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,850
Someone's dying in here!

611
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,320
Darn it!

612
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,300
Are you okay? You have spots all over your body.

613
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,800
Detective, please take me to a hospital.

614
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,440
It'll be useless.

615
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,000
The fatality rate is 100 percent.

616
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,410
The only difference is how long it takes.

617
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,250
How did this happen?

618
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,190
Since when did a police officer wear shoes...

619
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:56,720
that are spotless like that?

620
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,660
Darn it. Their stupid dress code.

621
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,200
Who sent you?

622
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,300
Yeon? Or...

623
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,370
Why does that matter now? You're dying anyway.

624
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,980
I'm sure you didn't come to watch me die.

625
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,440
I love watching death.

626
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,950
See? I even brought popcorn.

627
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,450
I go to funeral homes on purpose too.

628
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,890
What do you want? Tell me.

629
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,890
How dare you try to make a deal? You're terminal anyway.

630
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,600
Are you still reminiscing about being powerful through Imoogi?

631
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,030
If Imoogi dies, this disease will disappear too, right?

632
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,500
Probably.

633
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,740
Get me out of here.

634
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,170
- Why? - I've served Imoogi...

635
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,740
for much longer than you think.

636
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,310
No one knows as much about him as I do.

637
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,650
So? You'll earn your freedom purely by flapping your gums?

638
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,480
And fix your disease for free?

639
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,350
I don't like that.

640
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,390
I stink at fighting.

641
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,160
I hate getting scars.

642
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,900
I get it.

643
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,270
So that's why you're here. To keep your hands clean.

644
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:29,450
(Holding Cell 2)

645
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,590
He got away.

646
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,760
Who did?

647
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,660
The serial killer suspect.

648
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,400
Who let him out?

649
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,430
Well... From what I saw in the surveillance video...

650
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,200
What? Why won't you finish talking?

651
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,370
It was you, Detective Baek.

652
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,310
What?

653
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,410
(Gopbuni's Tripe)

654
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,250
I'll take your order.

655
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,220
We'll take an assortment combo and a bottle of soju.

656
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,250
- Extra cheese, please. - Okay.

657
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,300
(Gopbuni's Tripe)

658
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,830
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

659
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,670
There's so much cheese.

660
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,090
- What? - You're so pretty.

661
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,430
Promise me.

662
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,700
What?

663
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,370
Let's come back here during the first snowfall.

664
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,140
Okay.

665
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,980
Spend Christmas with me.

666
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,380
We'll go back to that beach we went to.

667
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,190
- Okay. - And on New Year's Day,

668
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,160
come over and have tteokguk with my parents.

669
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,460
And on my birthday...

670
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,470
What do you want?

671
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,510
Okay, I'll get it for you.

672
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,980
What must you do in order to keep all of these promises?

673
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,490
I have to live a long life.

674
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,360
Cheers.

675
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,880
What is this? It feels like I asked for it.

676
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,180
You should've told me it was your birthday.

677
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,820
Who celebrates their lunar birthday these days?

678
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,990
Only the moms remember.

679
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,330
It smells nice.

680
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,370
I live alone in my apartment...

681
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,940
with two tropical fish.

682
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,610
Do they have names?

683
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,540
Dukbae and Choonsam.

684
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,440
They're both Kims.

685
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,880
I promised to buy them a large aquarium with this paycheck.

686
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,390
Will you adopt them?

687
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,690
Here. Make a wish.

688
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,440
Please let me get a cake from Jae Hwan next year on my birthday.

689
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,150
That's the last of it.

690
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,030
This may be the last soju we ever drink...

691
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,460
together.

692
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,470
I'm going to savor it.

693
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,400
Why would you say that?

694
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,310
The thing inside of me said earlier...

695
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,140
that I have at most two days.

696
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,320
That afterward, I'll be nothing...

697
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,120
but an empty shell.

698
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,690
That won't happen.

699
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,760
Won't it all be better if I disappear?

700
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,460
If I die, Imoogi will disappear.

701
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,260
Then everyone I love, my family, my friends,

702
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,730
and you...

703
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,430
won't get hurt.

704
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,740
Don't think that ever again.

705
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,740
But then again,

706
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,780
how will you live,

707
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,650
left all alone, if that happens?

708
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,780
Then...

709
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,590
I'd blame myself for a very long time...

710
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,860
for failing to protect you again.

711
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,760
I'd feel the same way.

712
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,230
I don't think I can live a proper life without you anymore.

713
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,170
So, we must protect each other.

714
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,880
Let's not give Imoogi what he wants.

715
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,550
Hi, Jae Hwan.

716
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,990
What?

717
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,970
I told you not to come.

718
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:21,930
Why did you come?

719
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,080
Why are you here like this?

720
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:30,810
Why?

721
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,180
Don't touch me. You'll catch it.

722
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,970
Let's never meet again. We don't like each other anyway.

723
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,180
Who knew my last moment with you would end this way?

724
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,150
I know. You should've died by my hands.

725
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,190
Given what it is, do your best to survive.

726
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,420
It looked like you finally made up with your brother.

727
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,860
Can you handle the consequences?

728
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,230
No. Yeon won't forgive me.

729
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,960
I may never see him again.

730
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,070
But it's better than him dying.

731
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,970
Give it a rest.

732
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,610
Melodramatic ones like you never meet a pretty end.

733
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,840
The ground cherries are gone now.

734
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,580
All I have left is this one human life.

735
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,110
Don't jinx me.

736
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,150
I'm going to spend everything I have before I die.

737
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,450
Bye.

738
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,170
You protect her.

739
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,870
I'll free Yu Ri and save you.

740
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,690
How could I not have recognized him?

741
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,790
You have no idea...

742
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,630
how harsh I've been to him.

743
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,860
And you missing him dearly...

744
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,360
must've led him here.

745
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,530
But where does that get me?

746
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,700
I finally found him but look at what's happening.

747
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:26,940
Unbelievable.

748
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,810
Is this all a coincidence though?

749
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,540
Sorry?

750
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,710
Every fate entwined...

751
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,980
with Yeon and Ji A's...

752
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,620
is gathering in one place.

753
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:47,220
The lover of his past life, her family, their friends,

754
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,260
and their enemy.

755
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,030
I'm scared.

756
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,530
I'm worried that...

757
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,310
an event too devastating to bear is coming our way.

758
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,630
You'll stay here with me for the time being.

759
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,730
Get him to leave.

760
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,770
You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.

761
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,470
I would be sick by now if it were contagious.

762
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,140
Or maybe I'm just in the pre-symptomatic stage.

763
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,970
Will you just listen?

764
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,870
There's no chance I'm leaving. I'll be here instead.

765
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,340
You need someone to care for you.

766
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,480
I'm going outside to talk.

767
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,010
Look after her for me.

768
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,630
What about Mr. Choi?

769
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,770
He threw up an egg but still hasn't gotten any better.

770
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,540
What on earth is that egg?

771
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,140
It holds a baby snake.

772
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,510
Apparently, it eats people from within.

773
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,510
I can't watch her die like this.

774
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,820
Never.

775
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,920
It'll all be over soon.

776
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,330
Once he takes the bait,

777
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,790
I'll...

778
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,700
So until then,

779
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,340
stay patient for me.

780
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,910
Let's join hands and kill the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

781
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,450
Let me know if you change your mind.

782
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,390
You have until the sun rises tomorrow morning.

783
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,500
Take one more bite for me.

784
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,720
I'm doomed.

785
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,890
Sae Rom.

786
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,160
- Sae Rom? - Sae Rom!

787
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Oh, no...

788
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,710
I'm in. Together, we'll attack...

789
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,680
the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

790
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,310
Yeon and Imoogi?

791
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:36,680
You're joking, right?

792
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,320
This can't be.

793
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,980
Sorry?

794
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,380
This is a suicide mission.

795
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:46,720
Yeon's going to kill Imoogi and sacrifice his own life too.

796
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,260
Yeon, you'll end up being caught...

797
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,030
in the trap you set up yourself.

798
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,570
And just like this, we will step on the same stage.

799
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,270
A stage where one can never step down from...

800
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,980
until the other dies.

801
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,560
What are you doing here?

802
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,100
You must die for me to live.

803
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,330
I'll end this all myself.

804
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,640
Don't do this. If you do...

805
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,100
Farewell.

806
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,350
The forecast never mentioned any rain.

807
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,790
When did you get here?

808
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,590
As soon as it started to rain which no one expected.

809
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,760
Are you here to walk me home?

810
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,030
It's best not to walk in the rain.

811
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,670
What about work? Did you finish your daily task?

812
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:41,140
I only needed to edit a few frames which I did at the speed of light.

813
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,140
Who's this jerk that kept you from reuniting with your family?

814
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:46,310
- Mr. Choi! - And me.

815
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,140
- What? - I didn't bring my car today.

816
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,150
So it seems. Did you walk here?

817
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,580
It's only a 20-minute walk to your house.

818
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,950
Now that your parents are here, we'll have less time to go out.

819
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,290
Buy me ramyeon and I'll let you go free.

820
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:04,960
Fine.

821
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:19,780
One doesn't seem like enough.

822
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,140
It isn't. It really isn't!

823
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,950
I said we should buy two.

824
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,410
Two things make ramyeon taste better.

825
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,520
Do you know what they are?

826
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,220
One's kimchi, so what's the other?

827
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,850
The jerk who steals a bite!

828
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,590
I'll make it even tastier then.

829
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,970
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

830
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,000
I should hold off on the broth.

831
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,810
Why?

832
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,510
I don't want to crave soju.

833
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,980
How smart of you.

834
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,610
When untangled, ramyeon noodles are at least 40m long.

835
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,620
That's the height of a 13-story building.

836
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,380
Since when did this turn into Trivia Night?

837
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,620
I don't want even half of a noodle getting in between us.

838
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,720
Who confesses their feelings with ramyeon noodles?

839
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,660
Must you be so cute all the time?

840
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,900
I've been known for that since my days as a mountain spirit.

841
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,110
I haven't seen you this happy in a while.

842
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,980
I am.

843
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,310
My parents are waiting for me at home...

844
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,420
and you're here by my side.

845
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,620
My childhood dream has come true,

846
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,290
so I wonder who can help make that happen for you too.

847
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:48,260
I wonder how it feels to be human.

848
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:59,910
I don't care if you're human or a nine-tailed fox.

849
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,710
What matters is that we're together right now.

850
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,050
(Tale of The Nine Tailed)

851
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,920
If I don't stop this, she'll sacrifice herself...

852
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,350
to protect me just like last time.

853
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,420
Don't do it.

854
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,860
You need to understand me.

855
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:50,530
I'm going to wait for you...

856
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,230
just like how you waited for me.

857
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,600
This is the Underworld.

858
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,730
The place where I'm standing right now.

859
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,470
Do you even know what that means?

860
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,940
If I fail, I want you to kill him instead.

861
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,100
What if something happens to Yeon?

862
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,310
- How could you... - Was this your plan all along?

863
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,080
No. I can't do it.

864
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,210
No!
