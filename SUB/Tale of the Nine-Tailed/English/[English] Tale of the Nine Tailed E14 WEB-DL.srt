Yeon.

13
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,221
Yes, it's me.

14
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,331
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:49,302
As I was entering the room,

16
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,572
I could feel myself
losing control of my body.

17
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:57,101
It's all right. You did good.

18
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:01,881
I can still feel...

19
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:05,282
how it swarmed inside my head.

20
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:12,551
Let's hurry.

21
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,792
At least so I can be myself...

22
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,932
right before it all ends.

23
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,301
I want to be there beside you.

24
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,141
Let's end this.

25
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,641
Let's put an end...

26
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:39,351
to this exhausting fight.

27
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,082
Are you okay?

28
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,791
Drive.

29
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,332
Why?

30
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,131
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

31
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:31,701
Is it fun to bring
chaos to the world?

32
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:33,372
Is that what motivates you?

33
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,872
No.

34
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:38,411
Truth be told, I actually
prefer reading books.

35
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,071
Then why are you doing this?

36
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,011
Because I want Lee Yeon dead.

37
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:45,582
And you think he'll
easily cave in?

38
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:46,712
That's why I'm doing this.

39
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,522
He won't stop his
fight against me.

40
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,251
He keeps trying to defy destiny.

41
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,791
There's no turning back now.

42
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,302
We've both crossed
the line, you see.

43
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,671
Mr. Lee!

44
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:16,312
Did you get hurt?

45
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,381
Not really.

46
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,911
Well, you're about to.

47
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,282
How dare you fool me.

48
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,321
- This was the only way.
- Shut it.

49
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,821
It was pretty obvious...

50
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,321
when he gathered us
all for the meeting.

51
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:30,691
As if you knew.

52
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:32,161
He wouldn't have blabbed
about the Sin Slayer...

53
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,631
had he found the real one.

54
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,832
He would've bulldozed
over and slayed her.

55
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:36,862
What?

56
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,731
I'm saying that he's
a man of action,

57
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,231
not words.

58
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:44,171
So were you able
to get your answer?

59
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,712
I guess.

60
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,212
And what would that be?

61
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,642
- A key.
- A key to what?

62
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,411
The one Imoogi needs to
jump from body to body.

63
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,622
Do we have a way to drag
it out of Ms. Nam then?

64
00:04:58,821 --> 00:04:59,951
I can't be satisfied with that.

65
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:03,821
What?

66
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,291
My plan is to keep
it buried forever...

67
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,902
so that it never resurfaces.

68
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:13,402
Stop right there.

69
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,502
You heard me!

70
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:17,601
The moment you step
past those doors,

71
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,072
you'll lose everything.

72
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,572
I'll make sure of it!

73
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,721
And what is it do
I have to lose?

74
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,291
The Gatekeeper of Samdo River,

75
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,962
powers that nearly
match an Almighty,

76
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,032
and an immortal life.
I gave you all of that!

77
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,371
What I want though aren't those.

78
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:47,971
It's my wife and son.

79
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:53,012
Honey, but living with
you forever now...

80
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,181
is my biggest punishment of all.

81
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,322
Stop right there.

82
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:06,351
I told you to stop!

83
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,972
<font color="#00ff00">"UNVEILING URBAN LEGENDS"</font>

84
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,621
- Mr. Choi.
- What?

85
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,022
Did anything happen
in our absence?

86
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,452
Are you all right?

87
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,421
What did Mr. Choi say?

88
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,291
A police officer passed away.

89
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,192
- Cause of death?
- He says it was a heart attack,

90
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,971
but Mr. Choi noticed odd spots
on his body while performing CPR.

91
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,301
Also, he spit out an egg.

92
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:56,801
An egg?

93
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,241
Are they still with your boss?

94
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:02,712
Where are you right now?

95
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:08,152
So much for peace and
quiet in my latter years.

96
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,522
Never did I think
I'd see a man...

97
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:12,621
- die before my eyes.
- Mr. Choi...

98
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,921
Guys, get away
from him right now.

99
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:18,262
Got it.

100
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,132
Mr. Choi was at
the police station?

101
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:29,902
Yes, he performed
CPR on the victim.

102
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,671
Nothing happened though, right?

103
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:33,411
Not yet, it hasn't.

104
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,512
Check this out.

105
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:43,123
<font color="#00ff00">"VICTIMS COVERED IN SPOTS FOUND
MYSTERIOUSLY DEAD IN CITY"</font>

106
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,991
There's a rapid increase in
the number of victim's dying.

107
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:50,991
I need to get going.

108
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,361
Where are you headed?

109
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,332
Head home first.

110
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,632
Don't go there alone
and let them take you.

111
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,942
You must hurry, Yeon.

112
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,382
My wife will soon alter Ji
A's date of death on the list.

113
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,291
What's wrong?

114
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,871
It's just like he warned me.

115
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,272
What do you mean?

116
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,072
He told me he'll
spread a virus...

117
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:39,212
and kill everyone
that's precious to me.

118
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,382
Wait. My parents.

119
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,051
I'll go check up on them. You
should go and wait for Mr. Lee.

120
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,811
- But...
- Don't worry.

121
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,022
Mr. Lee Rang, please
take her home.

122
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,462
Ask me politely
to take you home.

123
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,402
I'd rather die than do that.

124
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:04,561
Then just die.

125
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:06,731
I won't be there to help you
when Imoogi comes for you.

126
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,272
To me, you're no
different from him.

127
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,611
Doesn't that apply to you?

128
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,971
You're the female Imoogi.

129
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,681
- Let's just go our own ways.
- As you wish.

130
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:28,392
She's so stubborn.

131
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:32,032
I really don't get what
Yeon likes about her.

132
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,652
What? What's wrong with this?

133
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,561
Wait. You dropped...

134
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,801
Mr. Hyeonuiong?

135
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:48,972
Fortunately,

136
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:51,772
I got here on time.

137
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,282
Are you sure you
didn't get hurt?

138
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:02,681
I'm okay.

139
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,852
The gatekeeper of Samdo
River is involved in this?

140
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,992
Thank goodness.

141
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,732
It looks like something big
is about to happen soon.

142
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:41,321
- Granny.
- Choose your words wisely.

143
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:45,561
I'm in a very bad mood
just as much as you are.

144
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,591
You messed with the list?

145
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,801
You turned your back on me...

146
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:53,502
and did something you won't even
be able to forgive yourself for?

147
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:56,671
You really chose to do that?

148
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,112
No matter what you say, I
won't withdraw what I wrote.

149
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,081
That is...

150
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,541
my choice.

151
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,482
Why not just kill the guy who
spread the plague? Why Ji A?

152
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:14,551
You already know you can't
kill him with a sword.

153
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,362
I see the blade won't kill you.

154
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,502
The problem is what lives
inside the girl's body.

155
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,201
We need to destroy that in
order to destroy the other one.

156
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,301
And to do that,

157
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,642
she needs to die.

158
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,352
I'm only going to say this once.

159
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,382
Return things...

160
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:43,551
back to how they were.

161
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,022
This is how it should be.

162
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:53,362
That's the only way it'll end.

163
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,461
No.

164
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,201
I won't let anyone...

165
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,571
take Ji A away.

166
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,382
And that includes you.

167
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:11,911
It's out of your hands now.

168
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,402
Go ahead.

169
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:48,782
Are you saying accidents
like earlier...

170
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:54,551
will keep happening until I die?

171
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,061
I'm glad I got to see my
parents one last time.

172
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,331
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,002
Why are you sorry?

174
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:08,431
You saved my life.

175
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:12,341
I tried my best to stop this.

176
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,841
But this is all I can do.

177
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:21,852
What about Yeon?

178
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:25,522
He went to settle
things with my wife.

179
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,191
- Will he be okay?
- I don't know.

180
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:35,331
Once my wife is convinced
that she is right,

181
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,561
she never changes her mind.

182
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,931
And Yeon knows that.

183
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:41,502
Then could he get hurt...

184
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,742
because of me?

185
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,872
He's probably willing to risk
everything he has right now.

186
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,492
You can use this
to take my life.

187
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,461
Just give me three more days.

188
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,591
If I don't catch him
within three days,

189
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:13,571
then just kill me with this.

190
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:17,102
I can't do that.

191
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,171
He's already out of control.

192
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,852
- I have his scale.
- It's too late.

193
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,081
I can catch him! I
can catch Imoogi!

194
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:32,591
How many more lives do you think
he'll take within those three days?

195
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:36,191
Their lives are just as important
as the life you wish to save.

196
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:57,311
Please don't do this.

197
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,821
Please don't kill Ji A.

198
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:10,421
I'll do anything.

199
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,331
- I'll do anything you ask.
- Just fight me instead.

200
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:17,032
Cut the nonsense and just fight
me like you'd normally do.

201
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,632
Please.

202
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:25,671
Get up.

203
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:30,311
I wouldn't have started this if
I was going to change my mind.

204
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:35,652
How could you do this to me?

205
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,982
I've already lost my child and
husband, so I can do much worse.

206
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,392
Even if that means
I'll end up losing you.

207
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,902
You'll regret this,

208
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,331
Granny.

209
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:05,112
Where did it all go wrong?

210
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,681
If it weren't for me,
Yeon would still be...

211
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:13,921
living as a mountain spirit.

212
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,222
No.

213
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,732
I never should've been born.

214
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:24,262
Listen. It's not your fault.

215
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,972
Don't hate yourself...

216
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:29,872
and deny the connection
you have with him.

217
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,301
I feel like it's all my fault.

218
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,941
We may be immortal, but
we're just like humans.

219
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,541
Our happy and precious memories
are what keeps us going.

220
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,152
For me, it's the
memory of my son.

221
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,852
For the Snail Bride, it's the
memory of her sweet husband.

222
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:47,222
And Yeon managed to keep
living thanks to you.

223
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,762
Imoogi told me...

224
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,262
that I'll eventually
end up killing Yeon...

225
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,301
with my own two hands.

226
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:58,462
That's why...

227
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,071
both you and Yeon
are trying so hard...

228
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,702
to protect each other.

229
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,682
I'm surrounded by dead ends.

230
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,361
Darn it. It won't light.

231
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,932
I thought you were quitting.

232
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:12,401
I've tried all sorts
of things to quit.

233
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:16,641
I chewed on mints, stuck
on patches, tried gums,

234
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:18,242
and even prescription medicine.

235
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:23,551
I tried all of that, but
I still couldn't quit.

236
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:26,351
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:28,752
What if, no matter
how hard you try,

238
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,121
the ending will stay the same?

239
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:36,131
If only one of you can survive,
either you or the girl.

240
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,702
The ending...

241
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,301
won't change. I see.

242
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:12,972
Want me to blow on it?

243
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,772
- Are you kidding me?
- Or do you want my car?

244
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,571
Why do I bother?

245
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,772
And hey, kid. Do something about
your runny nose when you're with me.

246
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,412
I have a weak stomach.

247
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:30,821
How long have you been wearing
that? Did you even wash it?

248
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,202
Buy some clothes at
a department store.

249
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,371
I'm very sensitive
regarding hygiene.

250
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,172
I'm going to the bathroom.

251
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:57,581
What are all these stickers?

252
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:59,482
You're dead when I come out!

253
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,121
What a nice day.

254
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:08,692
It's gorgeous out.

255
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:10,861
Your coffee.

256
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,492
This tree grew a lot.

257
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,962
It did. It grew nicely.

258
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,801
What are you thinking about?

259
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,912
Where were we...

260
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,111
while this much time passed?

261
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:33,182
Right? They say we
were missing for years.

262
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:35,111
It feels strange, doesn't it?

263
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,321
All I know is that we were
asleep the whole time.

264
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:40,252
It's odd that we don't have any
pressure ulcers on our bodies.

265
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,291
And it's odd how
nervous Ji A is too.

266
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,831
It reminds me of "Io Island".

267
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:48,791
"Io Island"?

268
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:52,162
You know, a fisherman accidentally
ends up on a fantasy island,

269
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:56,242
and when he leaves, he
realizes 100 years had passed.

270
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:01,871
Ji A grew really well,
just like that tree,

271
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,081
so I'm grateful.

272
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:28,002
Is this all we're eating?

273
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:29,172
It's good.

274
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:31,841
I want naengmyeon.

275
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:34,242
Yu Ri.

276
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,912
When is she coming?

277
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:37,682
I'm wondering...

278
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:39,311
when would be good.

279
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,982
Why are you only thinking?

280
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:44,081
Because once I finish thinking,

281
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:46,651
Yeon will lose something.

282
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:49,591
It has been over 600 years.

283
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,561
I plan to end this
fight once and for all.

284
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,032
What if you fail?

285
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:56,032
Rang.

286
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:59,831
That's why I need you.

287
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:03,601
If by chance something
happens to me,

288
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:08,472
I'd like you to
finish this yourself.

289
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:14,081
I'd like you to be
my final weapon.

290
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:16,952
I refuse.

291
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:20,051
Whether Imoogi
destroys the world...

292
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,121
or kills your
woman, I don't care.

293
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:24,361
We want to protect
different things.

294
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,561
- Rang.
- You protect her.

295
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:32,702
I'll free Yu Ri...

296
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:35,502
and save you.

297
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:45,341
Why are you smiling?

298
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:49,081
I feel like being a good
boy really isn't my thing.

299
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,321
Later.

300
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,262
Watch the apartment, Geomdoong.

301
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,662
Why am I Geomdoong?

302
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,071
Shi Young.

303
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,932
Oh, my. Hello.

304
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,101
What brings you
here at this hour?

305
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,242
Well... I wanted to have
a bowl of samgyetang.

306
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:21,182
But... You're not sick
or anything, right?

307
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:23,051
Of course, not.

308
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:26,952
I do 200 squats a day.

309
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,192
Do you want to see?

310
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:29,291
Goodness.

311
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:30,591
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

312
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,591
Serve him.

313
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:36,732
Seven cops were taken to
the hospital this morning.

314
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:38,631
What about Mr. Choi?

315
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:40,502
You saw him. He was fine.

316
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:44,002
I told him to see a doctor
anyway, but he won't listen.

317
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:48,311
If he's okay, we should
be okay too, right?

318
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,912
Let's worry about
editing. Walk faster.

319
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:58,121
You must be busy
prepping for the day.

320
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:02,522
I felt a weird taste in my
mouth. I feel so much better now.

321
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,162
What's wrong?

322
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,002
You don't look well.

323
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,502
Do I have a fever?

324
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:19,371
Not at all. You're so cold.

325
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:21,942
Give me your hand.
Your hand's cold too.

326
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,581
How could your body
temperature drop this much?

327
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,262
It's a snake egg.

328
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:51,002
He's sleeping again. Wake up.

329
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:53,071
Excuse me. Wake up.

330
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:55,972
Sir?

331
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,051
What happened?

332
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,321
He... He's dead.

333
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:10,722
Hey. Call an ambulance.
I'll go get help.

334
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,432
What?

335
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:47,891
They died?

336
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:50,361
Everyone on our floor?

337
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,331
Hold on.

338
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,942
Breaking news. People are
dying from unknown causes...

339
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,071
in masses.

340
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:06,182
The first of such deaths
occurred only two days ago.

341
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:09,381
It is presumed to
be a highly lethal,

342
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:11,422
highly contagious disease.

343
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:14,752
All of the victims
had red spots...

344
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:16,121
all over their bodies.

345
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,391
According to the autopsy
report of the first victim,

346
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,692
his organs showed signs
of fatal injuries...

347
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:23,702
as if attacked by a wild animal.

348
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:26,301
Kim, a man in his 30s,

349
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,232
had no underlying illness...

350
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,452
- How is it?
- It's lame.

351
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,151
It's not my style.

352
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,222
So it's normal.

353
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:52,022
Where are you going now?

354
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:53,232
I want to get some free tea.

355
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:55,791
I'll grant you a
visit to commemorate.

356
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:59,432
- A visit?
- With your boyfriend.

357
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:01,532
Go see him.

358
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,452
Yu... Yu Ri. Are you okay?

359
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,922
Let's meet up right now.

360
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:21,452
Right now?

361
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,022
Where?

362
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:28,032
I'll come to you.

363
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:50,722
Come out.

364
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:54,291
I know you're
hiding inside of me.

365
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,321
Come out!

366
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:00,992
Show yourself by the
count of three, or...

367
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:06,502
I'll kill myself.

368
00:29:08,732 --> 00:29:11,801
One, two,

369
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:14,172
three.

370
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:25,581
Crazy wench.

371
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:30,821
You dare to summon me when
you're merely a shell?

372
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,432
A shell?

373
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:37,061
That's rich coming
from a squatter...

374
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:38,762
who's staying rent-free.

375
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,631
Well, your body will
completely be mine soon.

376
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,371
I'll give it a day or so.

377
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:48,272
Soon, I'll be in full
control of your body.

378
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:50,041
That's slower than I thought.

379
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:51,942
Why?

380
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,111
It's been a while since
I lost the fox bead.

381
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:56,412
Call it the aftermath.

382
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:58,821
I've been bound by
it for too long.

383
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,591
Anyway, say your
goodbyes when you can.

384
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,962
Once I take control
of your body,

385
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,291
you'll be the one who
falls asleep in it...

386
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:09,391
forever.

387
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,432
In other words, you're
not in a stable state...

388
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,032
until that happens.

389
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,912
Darn. What can you possibly
do about it though?

390
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,012
What if I die before
you take control?

391
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,782
You'll never be able to.

392
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:27,212
You see,

393
00:30:27,982 --> 00:30:31,482
people can do just about anything
to save those they love...

394
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,462
like going absolutely crazy.

395
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:42,692
Help!

396
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,561
- What's wrong with him?
- Sir!

397
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,732
Please help. What's happening?

398
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:47,801
My gosh.

399
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:52,002
Somebody help.
Call an ambulance!

400
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,871
Can anybody help me?

401
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:00,482
You psycho.

402
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,581
That'll be all.

403
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,081
You can go back to sleep now.

404
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:06,952
That's all I wanted to confirm.

405
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:13,391
Listen, you woman. Lee Yeon
will perish because of you.

406
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:18,061
For he won't be able
to give up on you.

407
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:20,702
Rather than worrying
about my love life,

408
00:31:21,202 --> 00:31:22,772
I advise you to worry
more about your partner.

409
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,772
Being rejected must've
hit him hard...

410
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,381
because he's planning to take us
both with him to the Underworld.

411
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:32,341
That's absurd.

412
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,952
My date of death
has been altered.

413
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:38,551
Do you really believe
he had no idea...

414
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,391
that Taluipa would
go to such lengths...

415
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:42,222
to stop him from
slaughtering innocent lives?

416
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,321
Are you in here?

417
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,361
Yes, I'll be right out.

418
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,641
Yu Ri!

419
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,412
Are you hurt? Let me see.

420
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:08,512
I'm fine.

421
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:13,182
I'm glad.

422
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,452
I was worried sick about you.

423
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:18,462
How are you here though?
Did you manage to escape?

424
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,791
Why didn't you tell me that
Imoogi was behind this?

425
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,932
- And Mr. Lee?
- He's alive and well.

426
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,631
He never expresses it, but he's
worried sick about you too.

427
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,002
I'm glad.

428
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:35,972
Let's go. He'll be
thrilled to know...

429
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:37,482
- that you're back...
- I can't.

430
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:39,912
What?

431
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:43,111
I can't go.

432
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:46,222
I can't and you can't either.

433
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:48,452
What are you talking about?

434
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:51,422
I'm keeping you here
so that you can't go.

435
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,861
What on earth...

436
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:00,871
No.

437
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,002
Let me go.

438
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:09,472
I said we both can't go.

439
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:14,452
I'll grant you a
visit to commemorate.

440
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,982
With your boyfriend. Go see him.

441
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:22,422
Why must I do as you say?

442
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,992
Because if I lay my
eyes on Shin Ju today,

443
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,032
he'll die.

444
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,412
- Hey, Dad.
- My daughter.

445
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:48,182
- Where are you?
- Out, of course.

446
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:51,621
- Why do you ask?
- A friend of yours came by.

447
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,621
A friend? Who?

448
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:57,591
I told you not to open
the door for anyone.

449
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:00,762
Well, it was a
face we recognized.

450
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,262
Who can you possibly know?

451
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:07,532
- Yeon?
- No.

452
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:10,442
That young man with
a fair complexion.

453
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:12,172
The carnation.

454
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:15,541
What?

455
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:24,452
I told you that I won't
be as nice to you anymore.

456
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:28,022
You'll pay if you lay
a finger on them...

457
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,452
Don't defy your destiny.

458
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,891
I can shatter
everything you cherish.

459
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:39,331
Who are you? You're not
Ji A's friend, are you?

460
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:42,032
No, Mom. Don't!

461
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,972
"I wish to hang myself."

462
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:46,841
No!

463
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:51,886
"I wish to hang myself."

464
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,017
No!

465
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,326
You can't leave.

466
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,426
No, I must go.

467
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:05,727
My mom and dad are
in danger. Please...

468
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:07,866
Oh, no.

469
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:56,817
Sleep.

470
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,496
How did you know I was here?

471
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:14,496
I'm coming back
from Samdo River.

472
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:16,496
The old lady with
the Clairvoyance?

473
00:36:16,496 --> 00:36:19,007
She changed the date
of Ji A's death...

474
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,676
thanks to you
spreading the plague.

475
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:22,777
But she's still alive.

476
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:24,977
I just talked to
her on the phone.

477
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:27,647
Hyeonuiong's protecting
her in my absence.

478
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:30,547
Although, I doubt
he'll be able to last.

479
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:31,786
You said you're coming
from Samdo River.

480
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:34,016
Why didn't you beg the
old lady for mercy?

481
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:36,886
That I already did.

482
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:40,127
So it didn't work.

483
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:46,996
If Ji A dies, the other
half of you will perish too.

484
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:49,667
So?

485
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,576
What is it that you truly want?

486
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:55,136
Take a guess.

487
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:59,806
You exist to lack love.

488
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:03,277
Even as a human and even now.

489
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:06,446
The Almighty created a being...

490
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:08,857
that gets the short
straw on everything.

491
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:09,917
That's you, Imoogi.

492
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,496
Is a war what you want?

493
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:18,074
No, the opposite, actually.

494
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,937
- What?
- What if there was something...

495
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:22,567
other than your obsession
with me and Ji A...

496
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,207
that can satisfy you?

497
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:29,877
What if you were given a chance to
obtain a position not allowed...

498
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:31,746
to even lower-class
mountain spirit?

499
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,277
Enough with the cryptic talk.

500
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,773
The highest of all spirits.

501
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:39,276
No way.

502
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:45,648
The gatekeeper of Samdo River.

503
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:27,337
Let's join hands and kill the
gatekeeper of Samdo River.

504
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:34,806
How interesting. This
is quite unexpected.

505
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,447
I had no idea you'd think
of betraying that old woman.

506
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:41,076
I'll do anything to save Ji A.

507
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:43,717
So...

508
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:45,846
you're going to
hold hands with me?

509
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:50,487
Of course. Even if that means I
need to get my hands dirty with you.

510
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:52,887
And what's the condition?

511
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:54,996
Let Ji A go.

512
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:58,967
Get rid of your other half
from her body once and for all.

513
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:00,996
And don't ever
look for us again.

514
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:03,096
That's all I want.

515
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:05,706
If you were in my shoes, would you
not think that it could be a trap?

516
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:08,936
No, I wouldn't.

517
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:11,007
What?

518
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:20,956
Then try and guess...

519
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:23,686
what my answer is going to be.

520
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:28,157
You'd probably love to say no.

521
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,627
But you'll eventually
accept my offer.

522
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,436
Where does that
confidence come from?

523
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:42,637
Because we're both
at a dead end.

524
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:47,547
If you reject my offer,
you'll lose your other half.

525
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,746
And I'll lose Ji A.

526
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:54,157
In the end, we'll fight like crazy
and end up in the Underworld.

527
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:59,887
That's what I've been waiting for
after I had my last date with her.

528
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,427
Let me know if you
change your mind.

529
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:09,567
You have until the sun
rises tomorrow morning.

530
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,746
You knew Imoogi went
there to kill them,

531
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:28,715
but you still kept me here? Why?

532
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,214
Did he threaten you?

533
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,439
Or is he manipulating you just like
how he made you stab Mr. Lee Rang?

534
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:37,995
- It's neither.
- Then why?

535
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:40,001
Why did you do that?

536
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,167
Who cares what happens
to those useless humans?

537
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,176
"Useless humans"?

538
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,216
I thought you came to see me.

539
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:01,216
I was worried about
you like crazy!

540
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,156
But...

541
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,027
you just used me as bait.

542
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:11,067
You used my feelings for you.

543
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,627
- Shin Ju.
- Stop.

544
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:15,866
If you say one more word,

545
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:22,007
I might actually regret
liking you, Yu Ri.

546
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:49,196
I bet you were really
worried. They're both okay.

547
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,167
I erased their memories.

548
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:55,977
Your parents won't
remember meeting Imoogi.

549
00:41:56,636 --> 00:41:58,047
Thank you, Yeon.

550
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,346
It's my fault. I shouldn't
have left them alone.

551
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:06,987
It wasn't your fault.

552
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:09,957
I know you're always
there to protect them.

553
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:17,766
Thank you for saving
Ji A while I was gone.

554
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,797
What's your plan?

555
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,297
I'm going to join
hands with Imoogi.

556
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:26,667
- What?
- What do you mean?

557
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:28,507
Is it because of my wife?

558
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,237
Yes.

559
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:31,846
I guess my wife...

560
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,317
decided to give up on you.

561
00:42:35,676 --> 00:42:38,716
She gave me a chance
to fight one more time.

562
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:40,687
Be more specific.

563
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:43,216
I got myself two more days.

564
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,056
And you'll be fine.

565
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,857
Does that mean I'll be...

566
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:51,196
Yes, of course. I
won't let you die.

567
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:53,266
Not on my watch.

568
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,966
Then what about joining
hands with Imoogi?

569
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,707
It's obviously a trap.

570
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,306
I knew it.

571
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:02,576
What did my wife ask in return?

572
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:05,746
Nothing. She just asked me
to catch him no matter what.

573
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,846
- Yeon.
- Next time.

574
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:09,746
I'll tell you the
details next time.

575
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,487
I want to go eat with Ji A.

576
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:15,187
I'll go get changed.

577
00:43:44,886 --> 00:43:46,587
What if, no matter
how hard you try,

578
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:49,087
the ending will stay the same?

579
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:53,826
If only one of you can survive,
either you or the girl.

580
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,627
The ending...

581
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:59,227
won't change. I see.

582
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:19,487
Then there's nothing
more to worry about.

583
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,156
What do you plan to do?

584
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,727
I'll eat this.

585
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:36,196
I'll have the Imoogi inside
Ji A enter my body instead.

586
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:38,337
And along with the
other half, I'll jump...

587
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,036
into Samdo River.

588
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:44,607
So that he won't ever be
able to resurrect again.

589
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,417
- If you jump into Samdo River...
- Yes, I know.

590
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,516
I'll never get a chance
to be reborn again.

591
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:53,846
I also know...

592
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,886
that I won't ever be
able to go back to Ji A.

593
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:39,596
I'm sorry for troubling you.

594
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:43,297
You could've taken
me to a hospital.

595
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:45,167
It's useless to go there.

596
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:48,136
This isn't a normal kind
of illness, you see.

597
00:45:51,406 --> 00:45:52,707
It's cold.

598
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:56,777
Hang in there.

599
00:45:57,147 --> 00:45:59,087
This nasty fight...

600
00:45:59,587 --> 00:46:00,987
will soon end.

601
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:04,357
Make sure you hang
in there until then.

602
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:10,727
I guess I was
right. You're not...

603
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:12,866
an ordinary woman, are you?

604
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,636
My goodness, Hyeonuiong.

605
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:27,616
I was wondering why you
weren't at the restaurant.

606
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:30,317
I'm sorry...

607
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:35,786
My goodness.

608
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,156
Come see me outside.

609
00:46:45,897 --> 00:46:47,897
Do you even know who he is?

610
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:50,036
What are you talking about?

611
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:51,567
He's your husband.

612
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:54,707
- What?
- He's the husband...

613
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,636
from your past life, the
man you missed so dearly.

614
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:04,016
Is anyone there? Hey!

615
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:05,917
Someone's dying in here!

616
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:10,386
Darn it!

617
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:21,366
Are you okay? You have
spots all over your body.

618
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,866
Detective, please
take me to a hospital.

619
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:25,507
It'll be useless.

620
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,067
The fatality rate
is 100 percent.

621
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:28,477
The only difference
is how long it takes.

622
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:34,317
How did this happen?

623
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:42,257
Since when did a police
officer wear shoes...

624
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:45,786
that are spotless like that?

625
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,727
Darn it. Their
stupid dress code.

626
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,266
Who sent you?

627
00:47:58,007 --> 00:47:59,366
Yeon? Or...

628
00:47:59,366 --> 00:48:02,437
Why does that matter
now? You're dying anyway.

629
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:06,047
I'm sure you didn't
come to watch me die.

630
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,507
I love watching death.

631
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:10,016
See? I even brought popcorn.

632
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:13,516
I go to funeral
homes on purpose too.

633
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:16,957
What do you want? Tell me.

634
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:20,957
How dare you try to make a
deal? You're terminal anyway.

635
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:25,667
Are you still reminiscing about
being powerful through Imoogi?

636
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:30,096
If Imoogi dies, this disease
will disappear too, right?

637
00:48:30,437 --> 00:48:31,567
Probably.

638
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:32,806
Get me out of here.

639
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,237
- Why?
- I've served Imoogi...

640
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:36,806
for much longer than you think.

641
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:39,377
No one knows as much
about him as I do.

642
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:43,716
So? You'll earn your freedom
purely by flapping your gums?

643
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:45,547
And fix your disease for free?

644
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,417
I don't like that.

645
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:51,457
I stink at fighting.

646
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,227
I hate getting scars.

647
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:57,966
I get it.

648
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:02,337
So that's why you're here.
To keep your hands clean.

649
00:49:06,197 --> 00:49:11,836
<font color="#00ff00">HOLDING CELL 2</font>

650
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:18,506
<font color="#00ff00">HOLDING CELL 2</font>

651
00:49:24,556 --> 00:49:25,656
He got away.

652
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:27,826
Who did?

653
00:49:30,857 --> 00:49:32,727
The serial killer suspect.

654
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:34,466
Who let him out?

655
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:37,496
Well... From what I saw in
the surveillance video...

656
00:49:38,337 --> 00:49:40,266
What? Why won't
you finish talking?

657
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:41,437
It was you, Detective Baek.

658
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:43,377
What?

659
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:47,468
<font color="#00ff00">GOPBUNI'S TRIPE</font>

660
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:49,317
I'll take your order.

661
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:52,286
We'll take an assortment
combo and a bottle of soju.

662
00:49:52,386 --> 00:49:54,317
- Extra cheese, please.
- Okay.

663
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,436
<font color="#00ff00">GOPBUNI'S TRIPE</font>

664
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:10,897
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

665
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:15,737
There's so much cheese.

666
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:28,156
- What?
- You're so pretty.

667
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,496
Promise me.

668
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,766
What?

669
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:48,437
Let's come back here
during the first snowfall.

670
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:53,207
Okay.

671
00:50:54,076 --> 00:50:56,047
Spend Christmas with me.

672
00:50:56,216 --> 00:50:58,446
We'll go back to that
beach we went to.

673
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,257
- Okay.
- And on New Year's Day,

674
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:07,227
come over and have
tteokguk with my parents.

675
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,527
And on my birthday...

676
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:16,536
What do you want?

677
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,576
Okay, I'll get it for you.

678
00:51:28,176 --> 00:51:31,047
What must you do in order to
keep all of these promises?

679
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:40,556
I have to live a long life.

680
00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:47,426
Cheers.

681
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:04,946
What is this? It feels
like I asked for it.

682
00:52:05,317 --> 00:52:07,246
You should've told me
it was your birthday.

683
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:10,886
Who celebrates their
lunar birthday these days?

684
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,056
Only the moms remember.

685
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:17,397
It smells nice.

686
00:52:22,796 --> 00:52:24,537
I live alone in my apartment...

687
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,107
with two tropical fish.

688
00:52:27,537 --> 00:52:28,776
Do they have names?

689
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:30,707
Dukbae and Choonsam.

690
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:33,607
They're both Kims.

691
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:39,046
I promised to buy them a large
aquarium with this paycheck.

692
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:42,557
Will you adopt them?

693
00:52:46,727 --> 00:52:48,857
Here. Make a wish.

694
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:58,607
Please let me get a cake from Jae
Hwan next year on my birthday.

695
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,316
That's the last of it.

696
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:24,196
This may be the last
soju we ever drink...

697
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:25,627
together.

698
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:29,636
I'm going to savor it.

699
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:34,566
Why would you say that?

700
00:53:35,176 --> 00:53:38,477
The thing inside of
me said earlier...

701
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:41,307
that I have at most two days.

702
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:45,486
That afterward,
I'll be nothing...

703
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:47,287
but an empty shell.

704
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:48,857
That won't happen.

705
00:53:49,386 --> 00:53:51,926
Won't it all be
better if I disappear?

706
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:55,627
If I die, Imoogi will disappear.

707
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:58,426
Then everyone I love,
my family, my friends,

708
00:53:58,827 --> 00:53:59,897
and you...

709
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:03,596
won't get hurt.

710
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,906
Don't think that ever again.

711
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:11,906
But then again,

712
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:13,946
how will you live,

713
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:16,816
left all alone, if that happens?

714
00:54:19,816 --> 00:54:20,946
Then...

715
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:24,756
I'd blame myself for
a very long time...

716
00:54:26,526 --> 00:54:29,026
for failing to
protect you again.

717
00:54:30,526 --> 00:54:31,926
I'd feel the same way.

718
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:37,397
I don't think I can live a
proper life without you anymore.

719
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:42,337
So, we must protect each other.

720
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:46,046
Let's not give
Imoogi what he wants.

721
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:55,716
Hi, Jae Hwan.

722
00:54:57,986 --> 00:54:59,156
What?

723
00:55:07,366 --> 00:55:09,136
I told you not to come.

724
00:55:09,997 --> 00:55:11,096
Why did you come?

725
00:55:15,037 --> 00:55:18,247
Why are you here like this?

726
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:19,977
Why?

727
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:22,346
Don't touch me. You'll catch it.

728
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:45,136
Let's never meet again. We
don't like each other anyway.

729
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:55,346
Who knew my last moment
with you would end this way?

730
00:55:57,616 --> 00:56:00,316
I know. You should've
died by my hands.

731
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:04,357
Given what it is, do
your best to survive.

732
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,587
It looked like you finally
made up with your brother.

733
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:08,026
Can you handle the consequences?

734
00:56:08,426 --> 00:56:11,397
No. Yeon won't forgive me.

735
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:14,127
I may never see him again.

736
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:17,236
But it's better than him dying.

737
00:56:19,006 --> 00:56:20,136
Give it a rest.

738
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:23,776
Melodramatic ones like you
never meet a pretty end.

739
00:56:25,406 --> 00:56:27,006
The ground cherries
are gone now.

740
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,747
All I have left is
this one human life.

741
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:31,276
Don't jinx me.

742
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,316
I'm going to spend everything
I have before I die.

743
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:36,616
Bye.

744
00:56:50,937 --> 00:56:52,337
You protect her.

745
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:56,037
I'll free Yu Ri and save you.

746
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:00,854
How could I not
have recognized him?

747
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:02,955
You have no idea...

748
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,794
how harsh I've been to him.

749
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,024
And you missing him dearly...

750
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,524
must've led him here.

751
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:10,694
But where does that get me?

752
00:57:11,124 --> 00:57:14,865
I finally found him but
look at what's happening.

753
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,104
Unbelievable.

754
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:22,975
Is this all a
coincidence though?

755
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:24,705
Sorry?

756
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,874
Every fate entwined...

757
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,144
with Yeon and Ji A's...

758
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:31,785
is gathering in one place.

759
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:36,385
The lover of his past life,
her family, their friends,

760
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:39,425
and their enemy.

761
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,194
I'm scared.

762
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:47,694
I'm worried that...

763
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:52,475
an event too devastating
to bear is coming our way.

764
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:13,794
You'll stay here with
me for the time being.

765
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:17,894
Get him to leave.

766
00:58:17,964 --> 00:58:19,935
You shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.

767
00:58:19,935 --> 00:58:21,635
I would be sick by now
if it were contagious.

768
00:58:22,135 --> 00:58:23,305
Or maybe I'm just in the
pre-symptomatic stage.

769
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,135
Will you just listen?

770
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,035
There's no chance I'm
leaving. I'll be here instead.

771
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:29,504
You need someone
to care for you.

772
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:31,644
I'm going outside to talk.

773
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,175
Look after her for me.

774
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:48,794
What about Mr. Choi?

775
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:53,935
He threw up an egg but still
hasn't gotten any better.

776
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,705
What on earth is that egg?

777
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:00,305
It holds a baby snake.

778
00:59:00,935 --> 00:59:02,675
Apparently, it eats
people from within.

779
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:06,675
I can't watch her die like this.

780
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:08,984
Never.

781
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:15,084
It'll all be over soon.

782
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:19,495
Once he takes the bait,

783
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:20,955
I'll...

784
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:27,865
So until then,

785
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,504
stay patient for me.

786
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,075
Let's join hands and kill the
gatekeeper of Samdo River.

787
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,615
Let me know if you
change your mind.

788
00:59:43,115 --> 00:59:45,555
You have until the sun
rises tomorrow morning.

789
01:00:35,334 --> 01:00:36,664
Take one more bite for me.

790
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:48,885
I'm doomed.

791
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:53,055
Sae Rom.

792
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:55,325
- Sae Rom?
- Sae Rom!

793
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:56,325
Oh, no...

794
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:47,874
I'm in. Together,
we'll attack...

795
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:49,845
the gatekeeper of Samdo River.

796
01:02:21,274 --> 01:02:22,475
Yeon and Imoogi?

797
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:25,845
You're joking, right?

798
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:28,484
This can't be.

799
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:30,144
Sorry?

800
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:31,544
This is a suicide mission.

801
01:02:32,055 --> 01:02:35,885
Yeon's going to kill Imoogi
and sacrifice his own life too.

802
01:02:38,385 --> 01:02:41,425
Yeon, you'll end
up being caught...

803
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,194
in the trap you set up yourself.

804
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:47,734
And just like this, we will
step on the same stage.

805
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:53,435
A stage where one can
never step down from...

806
01:02:54,575 --> 01:02:56,144
until the other dies.

807
01:03:13,294 --> 01:03:14,725
What are you doing here?

808
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:17,265
You must die for me to live.

809
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:19,495
I'll end this all myself.

810
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:22,805
Don't do this. If you do...

811
01:03:23,205 --> 01:03:24,265
Farewell.

812
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:41,515
The forecast never
mentioned any rain.

813
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:12,955
When did you get here?

814
01:04:14,314 --> 01:04:16,754
As soon as it started to
rain which no one expected.

815
01:04:17,725 --> 01:04:18,925
Are you here to walk me home?

816
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:21,194
It's best not to
walk in the rain.

817
01:04:25,164 --> 01:04:26,834
What about work? Did you
finish your daily task?

818
01:04:27,194 --> 01:04:30,305
I only needed to edit a few frames
which I did at the speed of light.

819
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:33,305
Who's this jerk that kept you
from reuniting with your family?

820
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:35,475
- Mr. Choi!
- And me.

821
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:38,305
- What?
- I didn't bring my car today.

822
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,314
So it seems. Did you walk here?

823
01:04:40,675 --> 01:04:42,745
It's only a 20-minute
walk to your house.

824
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:46,115
Now that your parents are here,
we'll have less time to go out.

825
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:52,455
Buy me ramyeon and
I'll let you go free.

826
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,124
Fine.

827
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:08,944
One doesn't seem like enough.

828
01:05:08,944 --> 01:05:10,305
It isn't. It really isn't!

829
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:12,115
I said we should buy two.

830
01:05:12,774 --> 01:05:14,575
Two things make
ramyeon taste better.

831
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:15,685
Do you know what they are?

832
01:05:15,685 --> 01:05:17,385
One's kimchi, so
what's the other?

833
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:19,015
The jerk who steals a bite!

834
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,754
I'll make it even tastier then.

835
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:34,135
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

836
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:37,164
I should hold off on the broth.

837
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:38,975
Why?

838
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:40,675
I don't want to crave soju.

839
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,144
How smart of you.

840
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:47,774
When untangled, ramyeon
noodles are at least 40m long.

841
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:49,785
That's the height of
a 13-story building.

842
01:05:49,984 --> 01:05:51,544
Since when did this
turn into Trivia Night?

843
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,785
I don't want even half of a
noodle getting in between us.

844
01:05:56,254 --> 01:05:57,885
Who confesses their feelings
with ramyeon noodles?

845
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:00,825
Must you be so
cute all the time?

846
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:04,064
I've been known for that since
my days as a mountain spirit.

847
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:15,274
I haven't seen you
this happy in a while.

848
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:17,144
I am.

849
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:20,475
My parents are waiting
for me at home...

850
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,584
and you're here by my side.

851
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:26,785
My childhood dream
has come true,

852
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:30,455
so I wonder who can help
make that happen for you too.

853
01:06:33,754 --> 01:06:37,425
I wonder how it
feels to be human.

854
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:49,075
I don't care if you're
human or a nine-tailed fox.

855
01:06:50,104 --> 01:06:51,874
What matters is that
we're together right now.

856
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:29,437
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

857
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:33,224
<i>If I don't stop this,
she'll sacrifice herself...</i>

858
01:07:33,224 --> 01:07:34,655
<i>to protect me just
like last time.</i>

859
01:07:34,655 --> 01:07:35,724
<i>Don't do it.</i>

860
01:07:36,025 --> 01:07:38,165
<i>You need to understand me.</i>

861
01:07:38,495 --> 01:07:39,835
<i>I'm going to wait for you...</i>

862
01:07:39,835 --> 01:07:41,535
<i>just like how you waited for me.</i>

863
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:42,905
<i>This is the Underworld.</i>

864
01:07:43,065 --> 01:07:45,035
<i>The place where I'm
standing right now.</i>

865
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,775
<i>Do you even know
what that means?</i>

866
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:49,245
<i>If I fail, I want you
to kill him instead.</i>

867
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,405
<i>What if something
happens to Yeon?</i>

868
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:54,615
<i>- How could you...
- Was this your plan all along?</i>

869
01:07:55,044 --> 01:07:57,384
<i>No. I can't do it.</i>

870
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:58,514
<i>No!</i>
