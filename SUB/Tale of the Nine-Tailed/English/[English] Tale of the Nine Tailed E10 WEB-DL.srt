7
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,066
Where are we headed though?

8
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,757
Where A Eum and my
story began and ended.

9
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,006
This is the mountain
I used to rule.

10
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:46,497
It was my hometown, my home,

11
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:47,816
and my workplace.

12
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,135
Did you know that
there was a day...

13
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,305
similar to Valentine's
in Joseon Dynasty?

14
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,546
On March 5, when all
living things awaken,

15
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,415
couples exchanged ginkgo nuts
as a token of their love.

16
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,355
Why ginkgo nuts though?

17
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,325
Male and female trees
mate to reproduce...

18
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:32,456
and they live way
past 1,000 years.

19
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:35,126
So you're still holding on to
the Valentine's Day gift...

20
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,896
from your ex-girlfriend.

21
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,835
Actually, these
were a parting gift.

22
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,066
We parted ways after
exchanging them.

23
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,135
Here.

24
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,605
I'll protect you.

25
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:57,646
What?

26
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,116
A mountain spirits protect
all creations of the woods.

27
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:02,255
One must also be
protected in return.

28
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,125
Why you though?

29
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,685
Because I like you.

30
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,236
What gives you the right?

31
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,106
You're too powerless.

32
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,345
Why are you being this way?

33
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:29,476
Being able to converse with me
doesn't make you someone special.

34
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,446
In your dreams.

35
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:36,386
You'll never be as
powerful as I am.

36
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:39,285
In what way will you protect me?

37
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,296
You're a mere mortal.

38
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:44,896
Do you mean that?

39
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:47,465
Yes, I do.

40
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,676
So don't ever come
up here again.

41
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:09,886
You didn't mean it
though, did you?

42
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:12,585
I was scared.

43
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:17,396
I didn't know what would
happen if I fell for a human...

44
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,196
who would someday die.

45
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,565
How did you two meet again then?

46
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,835
Did you seek her out?

47
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,505
I'm the ruler of
the mountains...

48
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,905
and therefore bound to it.

49
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,476
A mountain spirit can't leave
where it has been assigned to.

50
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,046
What would happen if you do?

51
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,946
I'll grow weaker...

52
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,315
since I'll no longer have the
powers of a mountain spirit.

53
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,315
This one time,

54
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,726
I crossed the boundary
while chasing spirits...

55
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,226
that were disrupting the peace.

56
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,995
A nine-tailed fox has
attacked our village!

57
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,226
A nine-tailed fox? Is
that what you just said?

58
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,236
- We must catch it.
- My gosh!

59
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:57,106
- A nine-tailed fox!
- It's a nine-tailed fox!

60
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,206
Where did it go?

61
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,805
It left a blood trail.

62
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,905
- Over there.
- It went that way!

63
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:04,275
- Goodness!
- Go after it.

64
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,776
My gosh.

65
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:13,515
What a disgrace!

66
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,726
- Let's go that way.
- My goodness.

67
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,086
Can you believe it?

68
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:42,676
Now, go.

69
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,515
If you follow this path,
your forest will appear.

70
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,656
A Eum.

71
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,986
I did not see you today.

72
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,606
Thank you.

73
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,536
I will repay you for
this no matter what.

74
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:23,886
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 10: DEJA-VU</font>

75
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,635
I found you.

76
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,966
I'll soon be coming for you,

77
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,906
so sit tight.

78
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,745
What's so funny?

79
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,305
The stage is almost complete.

80
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:49,375
- "The stage"?
- Thanks to the Spirit of Darkness,

81
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,346
I was able to find
out that Lee Yeon...

82
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:54,286
will never be able to
kill her in this life.

83
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,786
But is there a reason why
it has to be those two?

84
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,195
I was supposed to have it all.

85
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,166
I was meant to be the
mountain spirit...

86
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,866
and have that woman by my side.

87
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,096
- Are you saying...
- I'm going to take over...

88
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,135
the mountain spirit's body...

89
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,106
and have her become my wife.

90
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,986
Gosh, this place is mesmerizing.

91
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:38,926
Why aren't you
asking me anything?

92
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,866
Why aren't you asking
me why I betrayed you?

93
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:49,036
Don't you want to
know why I killed you?

94
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:50,875
On my way here,

95
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:54,945
I noticed that there
are many legends...

96
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,245
regarding this
beautiful waterfall.

97
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,745
It's about a married couple
who were madly in love.

98
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:03,786
But some stories say the wife dies
and some say the husband dies.

99
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,526
So I'm sure there's also
something I don't know...

100
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,565
about the Tale of
the Nine Tailed...

101
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:15,236
where the nine-tailed fox tragically
had to kill his first love.

102
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,026
A Eum.

103
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:41,426
Why did you shoot me?

104
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,666
This woman's body
is very useful.

105
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,565
Mountain spirits never
let their guard down,

106
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,265
but I was even able to
shoot you with an arrow.

107
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,776
Imoogi.

108
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:00,916
Long time no see, Yeon. I
waited for you for a long time.

109
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:03,685
- Where is A Eum?
- In here.

110
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,356
She willingly gave me her body
so she could save her father.

111
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,385
Come out from that body.

112
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,325
I forgot to tell you something.

113
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,395
That was an evening primrose
from the burial ground.

114
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,765
I told you to come out.

115
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,505
- She's mine.
- Show yourself!

116
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,586
Should I kill her
and leave her body?

117
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:50,366
She means nothing to me.

118
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:54,596
- I do not believe you.
- You think you used her as bait.

119
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:59,035
But don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

120
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,316
Don't kill me!

121
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:52,456
I don't want to die.

122
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,995
You promised me.

123
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,336
You promised to love
me until the day I die.

124
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,665
Yeon.

125
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,356
No...

126
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,556
A Eum.

127
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:30,625
Is that you?

128
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,005
Don't come near me!

129
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:48,976
It's you.

130
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,846
I...

131
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:54,486
I killed the villagers.

132
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:03,525
I killed everyone.

133
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,495
It's not your fault.

134
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:11,665
Help me, Yeon.

135
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,236
Stop me from
hurting anyone else.

136
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,346
Stop me from hurting you.

137
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:24,816
Just kill me.

138
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,856
It's okay. You have me.

139
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,625
Everything will be all right.

140
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,706
This girl is pretty feisty.

141
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,415
You can't kill me, but you
can't keep me alive either.

142
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,395
What you want is me, right?

143
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,696
Take my body,

144
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,436
and let her go.

145
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,606
How touching.

146
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,745
Don't make me repeat myself.

147
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,946
Will you choose the body of a
mountain spirit or her body?

148
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:36,285
Fine. I'll let her go.

149
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:38,356
Instead,

150
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:41,056
give me your heart.

151
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,566
I heard the energy of
mountain spirits...

152
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,525
lies in their hearts.

153
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,436
Give me your heart.

154
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,306
A Eum.

155
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,675
You're listening, right?

156
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:03,915
Promise me one thing.

157
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,356
Promise me that you'll
forget about me.

158
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,255
Forget about me...

159
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,096
and live a long life.

160
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:28,135
You don't need to be sorry...

161
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,346
or grateful.

162
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,145
My life belongs to you anyway.

163
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,025
Who says you can die?

164
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,495
A Eum.

165
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,836
Let me go. I'm okay.

166
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,545
Yeon.

167
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,785
You asked me to forget you.

168
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:13,486
But I won't ask the same.

169
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,116
Don't forget me.

170
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,956
- What are you saying?
- I'll crawl out of my grave...

171
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,525
if you ever fall in
love with another woman.

172
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:28,596
Let go.

173
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,066
Repay what you owe me, Yeon.

174
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:35,535
No.

175
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,326
Please kill me.

176
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,826
See? I promised...

177
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,066
that I would...

178
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,135
protect you.

179
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:07,256
Thank you, Yeon,

180
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,625
for keeping your promise
not to forget me.

181
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,496
And...

182
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:16,836
I'm sorry...

183
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,205
for making you wait so long.

184
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,625
That's precious to you.

185
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,766
Because you are not
a shadow of my past.

186
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,965
I'll take...

187
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:48,665
a good look at you.

188
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,836
Not A Eum reborn, but you.

189
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:19,125
You're here?

190
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,195
I thought you had died in
the Forest of the Starved.

191
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,336
Whatever. I'm disappointed.

192
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:27,735
Now?

193
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,276
Well, come or not. Whatever.

194
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:45,385
Are you all right? Should
I call Shin Ju back?

195
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,096
Stop freaking out. It's nothing.

196
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,096
It isn't the poison, is it?

197
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,036
Your life is expiring.

198
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,606
I'm right, aren't I?

199
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,405
I've lived pretty
long for a half fox.

200
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,506
Please eat the ground cherry.

201
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,776
You can steal years from people
and live for as long as you want.

202
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:10,475
Yeon is on his way here.

203
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,516
I'm going to tell
him who Imoogi is.

204
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,556
I'm the only one who
knows what he looks like.

205
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,856
What about you?

206
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:22,826
It's not like I've ever
dreamed of the future.

207
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:24,725
Don't do it! Please stop!

208
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,796
Why must you go that
far just for Yeon?

209
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,705
You can't tell Yeon.

210
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,106
Don't meet with Yeon.

211
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:38,046
Go see Imoogi and
ask him to save you.

212
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:42,215
Or tell me where they are.
I'll get you a ground cherry.

213
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,016
Yu Ri.

214
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,086
Why are you crying for me?

215
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,516
It's infuriating!

216
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:49,756
I told you...

217
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,485
never to cry for another person.

218
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,026
Don't make your life a B-movie.

219
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:57,766
You said that I should be the
one that takes, not loses.

220
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,225
That's what you said to me...

221
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,735
when we first met, as you were
drenched in the zookeeper's blood.

222
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,536
You told me to live like that.

223
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,235
I tend to be fickle.

224
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:15,246
Stop sniffling, and go
buy me some naengmyeon.

225
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:17,016
I'm craving
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

226
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,895
I wish we could go
back to those days.

227
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,435
I can't remember how
the azaleas tasted...

228
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:42,905
back then.

229
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,356
Hey.

230
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,526
What are you so focused
on all day long?

231
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,655
I'm sure I've seen him before.

232
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,625
- Who?
- Ms. Nam's boyfriend.

233
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:08,965
Well, you are the best
at recognizing people.

234
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:10,735
What shows have
we done recently?

235
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,905
"The Gig Job Staircase",
"The Cursed Wedding Ring",

236
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,205
- "The Haunted..."
- Wait.

237
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:18,475
It was sometime around then.

238
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,705
This is driving
me mad. Who is he?

239
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:21,816
The red umbrella?

240
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:23,616
What do you mean?

241
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,316
You're right. The man
that you met that day...

242
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,326
is the red umbrella that
we had investigated.

243
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:49,635
What's wrong?

244
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:53,175
Am I not the person
you were waiting for?

245
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:02,215
Where did he go?

246
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,356
Yeon?

247
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:09,695
Do you know me?

248
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,566
Where's Rang?

249
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,395
I don't know. I stepped out, and
he wasn't here when I got back.

250
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,836
He won't answer
his phone either.

251
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,705
Seeing what a rude punk
you are, you must be her.

252
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,465
The necklace thief.
The dog owner.

253
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:22,375
The one with 99 points.

254
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,945
- What gibberish is that?
- Just something.

255
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:27,675
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

256
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,316
Don't eat that!
It's for Mr. Lee!

257
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,086
Naengmyeon tastes bad if
the noodles get soggy.

258
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:41,026
My gosh. You look so pale.

259
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,826
Will you keep a distance?

260
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,496
You smell like rotting corpses.

261
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:47,735
It's the scent of death.

262
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,735
Since I've lived much longer
than I should've, as have you.

263
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,235
Want one?

264
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,475
No thanks.

265
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:03,816
Do you plan to sacrifice
your life for your pride?

266
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,185
Is it worth it?

267
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,685
Do you think I'm desperate
to stay alive as you are?

268
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,155
Definitely not.

269
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:14,556
Then why do you look like
you don't want to go?

270
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,625
This is unlike you.

271
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,996
Get to your point.

272
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,996
Do you plan to defy our master?

273
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,606
He's "your" master,
not "our" master.

274
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,235
I know you're upset because of
what the Spirit of Darkness did.

275
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,935
But that was a misunderstanding.

276
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,806
You threw me into the Forest
of the Starved, but what?

277
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,516
A misunderstanding?

278
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,576
It was a risky move that
we took to catch Yeon.

279
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,286
We wouldn't have left you there.

280
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,185
Sorry,

281
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:44,756
but I can't bear to listen
to your lies anymore.

282
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:50,556
I'm sure you know that,
even in this state,

283
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:53,695
I can kill you no problem.

284
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:55,836
Wait. Wait a minute.

285
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:01,935
That's odd.

286
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,445
Your master should
show up by now.

287
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,746
Shall I take a guess?

288
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,056
Imoogi...

289
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:19,955
is not in this house right now.

290
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,465
That was good.

291
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,935
- What are you looking at?
- Get out. Scram.

292
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,056
All you have are ice cubes.

293
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,326
Is ice cream not
something you enjoy?

294
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:04,336
I can't believe he adopted
some rude pet from overseas.

295
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:05,566
I hate you, you know.

296
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,266
I never asked for your opinion.

297
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,405
Stay away from Mr. Lee.

298
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,006
- What if I don't?
- I'll kill you.

299
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:16,116
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Ki Yu Ri. Why?

300
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,316
I never asked for your name.

301
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:18,985
But you just asked.

302
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,455
You don't seem all
that smart to me.

303
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:24,256
Can you and Rang
even communicate?

304
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:26,685
- I'm smart, you know.
- As if.

305
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,895
Mr. Lee only adds mustard
to his naengmyeon,

306
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,266
gets blisters on his
lips after eating crabs,

307
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,395
and hates cucumbers in gimbap.

308
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,465
All you can name are
his eating habits.

309
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:40,366
But because of you... Because
of a jerk like you he...

310
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,076
You can't tell Yeon.

311
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:45,046
Go on.

312
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:47,875
Darn it. Just forget it.

313
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,395
You're laughing?

314
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:04,026
You can't kill me. You
shouldn't even think about it.

315
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:07,596
- What?
- I'm the one who saved you...

316
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:08,935
from the fatal wound
inflicted by Yeon.

317
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:12,866
What you owe me hasn't
been cleared yet.

318
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:56,576
Who on earth are you?

319
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,016
A passer-by who saw that
you were in grave danger.

320
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,316
As if.

321
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:05,286
I smell the stench of a
rotting corpse from you.

322
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:08,256
I'm a human who happened
to have prolonged his life.

323
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:10,056
Why did you save my life?

324
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,425
Does the reason truly matter?

325
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,566
All I want is for you to
return the favor one day.

326
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,665
I'm sure there will come a time.

327
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,526
You have a deal to abide by.

328
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:40,885
A fox can't go back
on the deal it made.

329
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,195
Thanks to me, you were
able to bring Imoogi back.

330
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:45,366
No, that was my doing.

331
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:48,266
All you added was
a bit of flair.

332
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:51,635
You approached me so that
you could use me someday...

333
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:54,975
knowing that Yeon
was my brother.

334
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:58,776
In what other way would
a half-fox be of any use?

335
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:05,445
Please consume
the ground cherry.

336
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:07,516
Live and return the
favor you owe me.

337
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:10,516
What do you want from me?

338
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:13,756
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

339
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:17,056
It's his body I need.

340
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,612
I should get going.

341
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:39,852
Yes, go ahead. So
long and farewell.

342
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,618
Rang talks about how
miserable his life has been,

343
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,289
but I guess it
wasn't all that bad.

344
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,999
Since you live to protect him,
please do so until the very end.

345
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:57,628
Give Rang this.

346
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,638
It's for the naengmyeon.

347
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,178
What on earth?

348
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,089
So let me summarize.

349
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:24,259
The man you're dating
is the suspect...

350
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,229
of that case we've
been investigating?

351
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,658
Not the suspect,
but the culprit.

352
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,698
Does he have a prior?

353
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,539
He's never been prosecuted,

354
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,239
but he's committed
similar crimes before.

355
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,239
And you're still dating him?

356
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:36,638
- Yes.
- Why?

357
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,309
Because he waited for
me to be reincarnated.

358
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,009
He's the first love
of my past life.

359
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,348
That's something we tell
stories about on our show.

360
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:45,378
Maybe it's a metaphor.

361
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,489
She loves him so much to
the point to feel that way.

362
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:55,529
Do you think it's a coincidence
that the three of us met?

363
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,428
I believe fate
brought us together.

364
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:59,829
Fate, my foot. Cut the nonsense.

365
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,628
Just tell me why.
What's going on?

366
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:05,339
The two of you
could be in danger.

367
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,908
You're the people
closest to me...

368
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,948
in my past life and
in this one as well.

369
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,608
Are you still going on about
this past life nonsense?

370
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,848
You're both too well-educated to
be convinced with words alone.

371
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:25,519
So see for yourselves.

372
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,729
What's with the spectacles?

373
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,799
- It's a tiger's eyebrow.
- From the Korean folk tale?

374
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,198
That's right. Do
you have a mirror?

375
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:35,269
Unbelievable.

376
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,799
Here.

377
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:50,608
What... What?

378
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,188
Where are we going?

379
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,928
Someplace far from the palace.

380
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,158
Is it just you two?

381
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,029
Our apologies, Your Highness.

382
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:10,128
We promise to keep
you safe though.

383
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,348
Goodness.

384
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:30,888
- Only set one table from now on.
- Sorry?

385
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:34,989
We're no longer in the palace
which means no one's watching us.

386
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:36,358
Join me for meals.

387
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:38,398
- That's absurd...
- Comply with the order,

388
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,658
or I'll starve myself.

389
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:43,999
Your Highness!

390
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:46,668
Are you going somewhere?

391
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,608
Yes, out to get some fresh air.

392
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:52,009
- Don't think about following me.
- Just please stay away...

393
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,279
from the forest up north.

394
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,708
- Why?
- Rumor has it that...

395
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,509
a 1,000-year-old
fox lives there.

396
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,009
A fox?

397
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,019
Your Highness,

398
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,019
here you go. It's fish.

399
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:09,559
You have rice on your chin.

400
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:18,598
Your Highness!

401
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,598
- Ta-da.
- Goodness.

402
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,809
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

403
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,779
You should sit too.

404
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,479
That won't be necessary.

405
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,348
Come on and join us. Sit.

406
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:37,019
Go ahead. It's quite
pretty, you know.

407
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,559
It'll suit you well.

408
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:43,658
What...

409
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,138
This is our past life?

410
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,208
Is this for real or not?

411
00:33:58,409 --> 00:33:59,909
Please tell me I've
been hypnotized.

412
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,018
Could this be VR goggles?

413
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:06,549
I just can't believe it.

414
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,989
If past lives do exist,

415
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,589
I reckoned I'd be a
princess, not you.

416
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:14,259
It's still better
than being a eunuch.

417
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:17,489
That little boy called
me a eunuch, remember?

418
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,858
- These are the same glasses.
- No way.

419
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,728
Being at this show for too long
must've messed with our heads.

420
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,069
So tell me.

421
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:27,168
I doubt you wanted to only
spread the shock around,

422
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,869
so why did you show us this?

423
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,509
The monster that's after me...

424
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,409
is a lot closer to
us than we think.

425
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,319
It might even be
someone we know.

426
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:42,918
I want to protect you guys...

427
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,909
just like how you protected
me in our past lives.

428
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,389
What about your boyfriend?

429
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:52,758
Who is he really?

430
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,599
Come inside.

431
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,369
Hello. This must be your first
time meeting a nine-tailed fox.

432
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,478
What's wrong? You
can't believe me?

433
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,519
They seemed a lot more
shocked than I expected.

434
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:16,019
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

435
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:18,188
I understand why they
can't seem to accept it.

436
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:20,559
Let me know if you need my help.
I'll just erase their memory.

437
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,188
Did you meet your brother?

438
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:28,099
No, I think Imoogi got
to him faster than me.

439
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,429
I see.

440
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,798
He used the Spirit of
Darkness to keep an eye on us,

441
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,969
so he probably knew...

442
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:37,568
that Rang will become a ticking
bomb once he starts getting swayed.

443
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,309
I was hoping we'd
get to find a clue.

444
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,639
Don't be too disappointed.

445
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,179
I kind of expected
this to happen.

446
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:46,878
So I had a back-up plan ready.

447
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:17,679
Where were you?

448
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,278
I want to be alone.

449
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,878
Rang, you look...

450
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,559
Did you eat the ground cherry?

451
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,119
Please...

452
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:30,929
let me be alone.

453
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,429
Look over there.

454
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,068
Yeon came and left it for you.

455
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,048
I can't believe this.

456
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,099
Yes, sir.

457
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,668
What brings you to
call me at this hour?

458
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,469
I have a personal
favor to ask you.

459
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,769
You have a personal
favor to ask me?

460
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,008
I'll do anything for you, sir.

461
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,978
Yes, he'll go see you tomorrow.

462
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:29,949
Thank you.

463
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,588
Sleep tight.

464
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:58,539
What about Ms. Nam? Doesn't
she want fried chicken?

465
00:38:58,608 --> 00:39:00,508
No, she must've been
tired. She's asleep.

466
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:02,108
Are you going to let her
stay here for a while?

467
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:05,349
Yes, this place is
safer as a basecamp.

468
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,688
Did you see him?

469
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,119
I didn't get to see Imoogi,

470
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:12,188
but I saw a middle-aged guy
taking Rang into the house.

471
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:15,119
He's probably the guy with a
criminal branding on his forehead.

472
00:39:15,258 --> 00:39:16,758
We know where he lives,
so that's good enough.

473
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,559
- Make sure you be careful.
- Okay.

474
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,599
Here you go.

475
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,648
Why do you always give
me the drumsticks?

476
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:37,809
Because they're drumsticks.

477
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,548
Thank you for the meal.

478
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,088
Thanks a lot.

479
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,258
For both this and the incident
with the Spirit of Darkness.

480
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,898
The people at the Samdo
River helped me out.

481
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:58,499
That granny...

482
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,199
never gives anyone
anything for free.

483
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:04,068
What did you have to give
her? What was the deal?

484
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:06,139
I signed a slave contract.

485
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:08,409
What?

486
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,148
I promised to sail ships
at the Samdo River.

487
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:12,679
I'll be in charge of taking
the dead to the Underworld.

488
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,719
Apparently, they're short of hands
because it's an aging society.

489
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,088
But you get seasick.

490
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,188
I'll be working
there after I die.

491
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,519
I'm sure I won't get
seasick once I'm dead.

492
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:21,989
You do.

493
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:30,499
You know what? I'll have you
transferred to a desk job.

494
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:32,199
I'll bribe the upper management.

495
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:34,469
I'm going to count on you.

496
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,008
But just so you know, I still
have a long life to live.

497
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,008
You should hit things off with
that necklace thief before you die.

498
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,878
Will you please call her by
her beautiful name, Yu Ri?

499
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,048
Did you meet her?

500
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,258
Yes, she's a pretty
decent person.

501
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,809
You overslept.

502
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,208
Why do you look so startled?

503
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,749
You know who I am, right?

504
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,559
- Gosh, my stomach hurts.
- My stomach is killing me.

505
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,188
- Do you guys want some coffee?
- Yes, hurry.

506
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:42,008
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

507
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:49,749
I feel like I'm in a nice cafe.

508
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,679
- It's sweet, isn't it?
- It tastes like a barista made it.

509
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,789
I'd ask for nothing more if
my life was just as sweet...

510
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:58,958
as this coffee.

511
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,619
Hey, about yesterday...

512
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:05,088
I looked everywhere
for you guys.

513
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,199
Wrap it up and
come to the office.

514
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:09,298
Hurry.

515
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,398
Come on. Hurry.

516
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:12,798
Come inside.

517
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:13,969
What's the fuss?

518
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:15,969
Say hello.

519
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,969
He's our new intern.

520
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:20,239
I look forward to
working with you guys.

521
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,249
How did you find this place?

522
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,019
That's a business secret.
You don't need to know that.

523
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,758
I looked everywhere, but I
couldn't find it. Where is it?

524
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:37,628
I don't know.

525
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:40,199
I didn't even tell you
what I was looking for.

526
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,228
Everyone says that at first.

527
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,269
I really don't know.

528
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,838
Didn't you hear the rumors?

529
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,878
People tend to tell me
things when they meet me.

530
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:54,438
What are you talking about?

531
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,778
Look.

532
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,249
It's a great day
to torture someone.

533
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:07,418
My name is Terry.

534
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,159
It sounds similar to Terrius.

535
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,458
It's easy to remember, right?
Did you say you were 22?

536
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:14,258
He goes to a university in
the US. He's an Ivy Leaguer.

537
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,769
Who helped you get
an intern job here?

538
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:18,769
- What?
- All the interns here...

539
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:19,898
get their jobs
using connections.

540
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:22,708
And judging by how kind
the team manager is to you,

541
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,039
I'm guessing it's
someone very high up.

542
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,039
What's the matter with you?

543
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:29,478
She can be very feisty.

544
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:31,978
You need to be careful. It
gets worse when she's hungry.

545
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:34,548
He's not my dad, but my guardian
is an important figure...

546
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,588
in this industry.

547
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:36,749
He works in this industry?

548
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:38,389
Yes.

549
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:40,588
I like that you're honest.

550
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:43,688
My name is Nam Ji A.

551
00:43:53,668 --> 00:43:55,739
It's nice to see
you guys get along.

552
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,139
My gosh, this is nice.

553
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,838
Be nice to him, okay?

554
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,878
Send me the documents
I asked for earlier.

555
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,318
By the way, have we met before?

556
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:12,519
I'm not sure.

557
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:26,369
Why can't I hear anything?

558
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,608
He may be an intern, but
he's pretty much our boss.

559
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:34,778
Unbelievable.

560
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,079
I can't believe a guy
can be that handsome.

561
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,719
If I earn brownie points
from the president this time,

562
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,849
I will be the youngest
station director ever.

563
00:44:56,398 --> 00:44:59,269
He has finally begun
to make his move.

564
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:03,769
The only way to
stop the calamity...

565
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:11,108
Is that child's
sacrifice the only way?

566
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:15,449
<font color="#00ff00">DEAD SOULS MANAGEMENT CENTER</font>

567
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,289
Shake, shake, shake.

568
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:26,728
Honey.

569
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:31,469
You know it's our wedding
anniversary. Did you forget again?

570
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,898
Do you even love me?

571
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,539
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

572
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:40,409
Look at the time.

573
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:43,749
Why didn't you answer the phone?

574
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,579
Why were you charging up a
storm with my credit card?

575
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:52,289
It's true. People do not change.

576
00:45:53,188 --> 00:45:56,858
Honey bear! Guess
what I brought!

577
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,228
But first, guess what I'm
holding behind my back.

578
00:46:02,228 --> 00:46:03,429
I'm not sure.

579
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:07,469
That hurts.

580
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:11,668
I said not to stray
from your duties.

581
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:13,539
No. I paid a lot for that.

582
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,309
Look at this hairdo.

583
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,148
Is the Afterlife a club?

584
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,918
Seriously.

585
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:23,289
Gosh.

586
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:36,068
I have a favor to ask you.

587
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,508
I'm willing to do anything now.

588
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:46,739
I'll do anything to save
both myself and that woman.

589
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,478
What can I do for you?

590
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:58,588
First, open Granny's
heart a little.

591
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,429
Open her heart?

592
00:47:05,758 --> 00:47:07,329
I'm sure she knows...

593
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,329
how to get rid of Imoogi.

594
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:14,199
She has been worried to death
ever since Imoogi awoke.

595
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,938
She would've done something
if she knew the way.

596
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,838
It may require breaking
a forbidden law.

597
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,239
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A, TERRY</font>

598
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,088
Is there something on
the back of my head?

599
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,188
- No.
- No.

600
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:14,499
- Just say it.
- Well...

601
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,499
Are you even human?

602
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:20,199
How could you be so
calm after what you saw?

603
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,898
What did she see?

604
00:48:22,938 --> 00:48:25,309
- It's nothing.
- Are you being sassy with me?

605
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:28,139
It really is nothing.

606
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,208
If it's nothing,
tell me. What is it?

607
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,978
- Did you see the breaking news?
- Breaking news?

608
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:37,349
They found a mummy in
a construction site.

609
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,989
A mummy? Not in Egypt,
but in our country?

610
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,659
Terry. Let me see that.

611
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:43,789
Thanks.

612
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:48,798
What...

613
00:48:48,898 --> 00:48:51,668
My gosh. This looks
fun. This is great.

614
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:53,999
Hey. Jae Hwan. Get going.

615
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:56,438
- I have an interview in an hour.
- Get me a camera.

616
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:58,208
- I'll go.
- Okay.

617
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:01,978
May I go as well?

618
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:07,548
Listen up, intern.

619
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:09,989
This isn't training.
This is the real deal.

620
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,219
It may be a blurb in your resume,
but this is our occupation.

621
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:16,228
If you get in the way
of the investigation...

622
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:17,329
Fire me.

623
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:20,228
I'm going to check the camera.

624
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:25,568
Where did you learn
how to use the camera?

625
00:49:26,499 --> 00:49:29,338
I taught myself. I'm not sure if
I'm good enough for you though.

626
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:33,139
- Can you film it?
- Yes.

627
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,679
Even dead bodies?

628
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,108
- I have to film dead bodies?
- Yes.

629
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,148
To be honest, I'm
not sure I can.

630
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:41,918
Why not?

631
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:45,148
I don't think the
deceased will welcome it.

632
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:50,728
- What do you mean?
- Whatever the reason may be,

633
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:54,599
I think I'd be sad if my death was
being displayed to strangers...

634
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,929
through a camera.

635
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,139
- You're qualified.
- Excuse me?

636
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,679
People whose curiosity comes
first when they see dead people...

637
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,679
aren't qualified to be a
cameraman in my opinion.

638
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,949
Does that mean I pass?

639
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,418
You pass.

640
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,719
- Why are you smiling?
- Because I'm happy.

641
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,318
About what?

642
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:20,918
Because I like you.

643
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:38,102
You're looking for your cat,
right? A female Russian Blue.

644
00:50:38,471 --> 00:50:40,642
Go to the bathroom
behind Soobyung Park.

645
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,212
I heard from stray cats in
the area, so it's reliable.

646
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:46,042
You can send the 200 dollars
of finder's fee to my account.

647
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,181
Hello?

648
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,151
Darn it.

649
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,451
Hey.

650
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:55,951
What brings you here?

651
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,570
I wanted to drink,
but no bars were open.

652
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:03,109
- Drink?
- Forget it if you don't want to.

653
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,839
What's your problem?

654
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:10,450
Anastasia was waiting for you.

655
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,850
Don't act like we're close.

656
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:17,649
Why are you laughing?

657
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,220
She wants to join us since
you have beef jerky in there.

658
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,700
How did you know that?

659
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,629
I'll give you a
doggy jerky treat.

660
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:36,839
Hey. Hi Yeon.

661
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:48,749
That punk is so dejected.

662
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,470
<font color="#00ff00">LEE RANG</font>

663
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,080
Look who's here.

664
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,080
I came to ask you something.

665
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:17,450
Let me ask you something first.

666
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,950
Tell me. What do you think I am?

667
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,189
- What else?
- Answer me.

668
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:33,100
Master of Samdo River between the
Living Realm and the Afterlife.

669
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,930
With your insight, you can...

670
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:38,129
Wrong.

671
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,499
When was it?

672
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:47,080
When asked the same question at
that very spot, Yeon said this.

673
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,379
"I hope you get
rheumatoid arthritis."

674
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:54,350
Show yourself.

675
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:57,220
Darn it.

676
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:04,990
Did you think that little
trick would work on me?

677
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:06,330
I thought maybe it would.

678
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:10,030
You've picked up bad habits
from your big brother.

679
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,370
Yeon doesn't do disguises.

680
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,470
He thinks it's ignoble.

681
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:18,470
Both the before and
after are annoying faces.

682
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:20,879
But I am curious.

683
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,109
Why did this fugitive fox...

684
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:28,249
come voluntarily to
this dangerous place?

685
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,390
Should I send you
to the Underworld?

686
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:34,589
Let me go today.

687
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:37,129
I'm way on top of
the list anyway.

688
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:38,260
Hey!

689
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:40,459
You punks.

690
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:42,229
The Underground isn't
some restaurant...

691
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:43,629
you can swing by whenever
you feel like it.

692
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:45,530
It doesn't scare me.

693
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:48,399
Why would it...

694
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,640
when your brother will
be accompanying you?

695
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:55,640
What's wrong? Isn't it what
you've desired for so long?

696
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,019
You desperately wanted to
end your brother's life.

697
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:06,720
Of course, you would
know everything.

698
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:10,830
Since you know, I'll
be straight with you.

699
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,430
I wish to break a deal.

700
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,229
Why did you save my life?

701
00:54:16,229 --> 00:54:18,169
All I want is for you to
return the favor one day.

702
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,640
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

703
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,740
It's his body I need.

704
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,390
There's a reason...

705
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:48,729
why the Almighty shackled
you to one rule...

706
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:51,399
while giving you the power
humans can never dream to have.

707
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,370
It's because he despised
those arrogant as you...

708
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,809
who would end up trying
to dominate humans.

709
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,309
You can swear at me all you want
as long as there's a way around it.

710
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:06,749
Well, there is.

711
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,589
What is it?

712
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,620
Die.

713
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,589
Only the fox's death...

714
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:21,600
can break a deal made by a fox.

715
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,180
Rather than thinking
about breaking the deal,

716
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,950
think of a way to
untangle the mess.

717
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,519
- What?
- Keep in mind...

718
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,519
that all deals follow
the rule of quid pro quo.

719
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,499
The fact that Mr. Lee
could die scares me.

720
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,339
I have no friends and no family.

721
00:56:03,539 --> 00:56:04,769
I have no one.

722
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,510
What are you talking about?
You have Anastasia...

723
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,240
and also me.

724
00:56:15,879 --> 00:56:18,950
If it weren't for Mr. Lee, I
would've been put to death...

725
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:20,559
at that unlicensed zoo.

726
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:24,330
Kids banging on the glass
kept me up during the day...

727
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,600
and ticks irritated me at night to
the point that I couldn't sleep.

728
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:30,769
I kept shedding fur,
the food was awful,

729
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,970
and the zookeeper
physically abused me.

730
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:35,470
What? Where on
earth is that place?

731
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,470
I'll skin him and eat
him alive if I could.

732
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:40,640
How dare he beat you!

733
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:44,309
Are you drunk?

734
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,649
What?

735
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,450
- Sorry about that.
- Why are you apologizing?

736
00:56:51,189 --> 00:56:53,050
I prefer the rougher
you, you know.

737
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:55,459
- Really?
- Yes.

738
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,830
Just so you know, my
nickname used to be CF.

739
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,729
- "Crazy Fox."
- Really? You?

740
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,629
I lost all three of my sisters
to a trap set by humans...

741
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,140
and that made me lose it.

742
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,240
Tell me more in detail.

743
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,740
Hunters, woodcutters, salt
merchants, and many others.

744
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,109
I'd bewitch everyone I saw.

745
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,450
You have no idea how many
died after losing their minds.

746
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,249
You're more of a
scumbag than I am.

747
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:23,220
I escaped the mountain
spirit I served...

748
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,559
to save my life and ended
up in Mr. Lee's forest.

749
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,089
- And?
- The former spirit yelled...

750
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:31,629
and demanded to
send me back to him,

751
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,899
but Mr. Lee Yeon said this.

752
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:35,729
What's with the yelling?

753
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,970
No way. What enters my
forest belongs to me.

754
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,070
That's when I decided...

755
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:46,640
to serve Mr. Lee.

756
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,010
That's how I ended up training
in the medical field and...

757
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,249
How about we sleep together?

758
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,850
- What?
- Sleep with me.

759
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,550
I especially love that
messy past of yours.

760
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,220
There are a few steps
in a relationship.

761
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,830
You either ask someone
out on a date first...

762
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,760
or ask them to be your
boyfriend or girlfriend.

763
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:12,470
I'd rather skip all that.

764
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,140
Never in my life have I seen
a body like this before.

765
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:20,939
I couldn't sleep at all...

766
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:22,740
due to the images that kept
flashing before my eyes.

767
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:25,280
- Is it a real mummy?
- See it for yourself.

768
00:58:26,749 --> 00:58:29,320
Hey, you. No filming.

769
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,419
The corpse is too dry to get
a viable fingerprint anyway.

770
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,260
We need to know the details...

771
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,919
if we want people to
call us with tips.

772
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,760
When have I ever published
anything without your permission?

773
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,530
The disappearance of all
those island people...

774
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
Okay, fine.

775
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:56,080
Has the body been
drained of blood?

776
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,749
Think of a tree that's been
drained of all its sap.

777
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,220
No visible trauma.

778
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:04,990
She was found at a
construction site?

779
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,559
The workers found her...

780
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:08,789
and it seems like no one
bothered to bury her.

781
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,559
So it wasn't put
there to be hidden...

782
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:13,899
but to be put on display?

783
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,399
What if she died
by a natural cause?

784
00:59:17,499 --> 00:59:19,399
There's a chance that
she could've died...

785
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:22,399
of dehydration at an
abandoned construction site.

786
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:24,339
A body that died of
natural causes...

787
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:26,209
was once found in
Gyeonggi Province in 2002.

788
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:28,740
I remember that. The lady
from the Papyong Yoon clan?

789
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,879
The lady from the
Papyong Yoon clan...

790
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,879
was buried under stone that
was as think as concrete.

791
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:35,620
The stone sealed the
grave from air getting in.

792
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,490
The body didn't decay because
the air had been removed.

793
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,660
This couldn't have happened if
the body was exposed to air...

794
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,530
like at the construction site.

795
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,490
Are you saying someone
did this to her?

796
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,539
What are you staring at?

797
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,649
This looks familiar.

798
01:00:05,749 --> 01:00:06,919
These nails...

799
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:29,269
Detective Baek, I
should get going.

800
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,140
- Just like that?
- Hand him everything else...

801
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,339
you have on the body.

802
01:00:32,669 --> 01:00:34,140
Hold on. Ji A!

803
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,339
Do you perhaps know the woman
who wore this fake nail?

804
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:14,519
Did you see it too?

805
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,320
The body that is all skin.

806
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:21,959
Astonishing, isn't it?

807
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,300
What on earth are you?

808
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,169
What do I look like to you?

809
01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:46,950
Seogyeong Traitor.

810
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,350
Signs of human
branding was present.

811
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,289
"Seo" as in west and
"Gyeong" as in Seoul.

812
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:58,129
You're the one who
took my parents!

813
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,379
This is the carnation
I folded for them.

814
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,939
See what's on the back.

815
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,846
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

816
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:01,089
Ji A, why won't you save us?

817
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:05,390
Are they alive?

818
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,260
Where?

819
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,300
Bring me the mountain spirit and
I'll return your parents to you.

820
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,720
I told you to sit
tight, didn't I?

821
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,340
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

822
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,010
You haven't changed at all.
You're still very arrogant.

823
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,149
You must think you have
the world at your feet.

824
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:35,580
I don't know about anything else,
but I do think that way about you.

825
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,419
You make me want
to trample on you.

826
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:39,649
Your brother, your woman,

827
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:41,789
and the life of her parents.

828
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:43,930
I have control over them all.

829
01:04:44,959 --> 01:04:46,129
What do you have?

830
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:48,899
Let me make a reasonable offer.

831
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,499
Yeon, if you give up your body,
I will let everyone else live.

832
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,809
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

833
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,510
<i>Your woman and the
life of her parents.</i>

834
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,209
<i>I have control over them all.</i>

835
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:38,649
<i>Is there a way to take out
what's inside Ji A's body?</i>

836
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,010
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

837
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,950
<i>I want to kill him.</i>

838
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:44,620
<i>What am I to you?</i>

839
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,720
<i>You got abandoned again.</i>

840
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:48,019
<i>I want to live.</i>

841
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,990
<i>So how about you help
me out and just die?</i>

842
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,229
<i>I'm going to put an end
to this exhausting fight.</i>
