1
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,866
Where are we headed though?

2
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:48,635
Where A Eum and my
story began and ended.

3
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,806
This is the mountain
I used to rule.

4
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,297
It was my hometown, my home,

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,616
and my workplace.

6
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:26,935
Did you know that
there was a day...

7
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,105
similar to Valentine's
in Joseon Dynasty?

8
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:32,346
On March 5, when all
living things awaken,

9
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,215
couples exchanged ginkgo nuts
as a token of their love.

10
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:38,155
Why ginkgo nuts though?

11
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:41,125
Male and female trees
mate to reproduce...

12
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,256
and they live way
past 1,000 years.

13
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,926
So you're still holding on to
the Valentine's Day gift...

14
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,696
from your ex-girlfriend.

15
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,635
Actually, these
were a parting gift.

16
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,866
We parted ways after
exchanging them.

17
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:55,935
Here.

18
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,405
I'll protect you.

19
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,446
What?

20
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,916
A mountain spirits protect
all creations of the woods.

21
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,055
One must also be
protected in return.

22
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:14,925
Why you though?

23
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,485
Because I like you.

24
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,036
What gives you the right?

25
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:34,906
You're too powerless.

26
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,145
Why are you being this way?

27
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,276
Being able to converse with me
doesn't make you someone special.

28
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,246
In your dreams.

29
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,186
You'll never be as
powerful as I am.

30
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,085
In what way will you protect me?

31
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,096
You're a mere mortal.

32
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:55,696
Do you mean that?

33
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,265
Yes, I do.

34
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:04,476
So don't ever come
up here again.

35
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,686
You didn't mean it
though, did you?

36
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,385
I was scared.

37
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:28,196
I didn't know what would
happen if I fell for a human...

38
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,996
who would someday die.

39
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,365
How did you two meet again then?

40
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,635
Did you seek her out?

41
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:38,305
I'm the ruler of
the mountains...

42
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,705
and therefore bound to it.

43
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:43,276
A mountain spirit can't leave
where it has been assigned to.

44
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,846
What would happen if you do?

45
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,746
I'll grow weaker...

46
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,115
since I'll no longer have the
powers of a mountain spirit.

47
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,115
This one time,

48
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,526
I crossed the boundary
while chasing spirits...

49
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,026
that were disrupting the peace.

50
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,795
A nine-tailed fox has
attacked our village!

51
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:02,026
A nine-tailed fox? Is
that what you just said?

52
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:05,036
- We must catch it.
- My gosh!

53
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,906
- A nine-tailed fox!
- It's a nine-tailed fox!

54
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,006
Where did it go?

55
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,605
It left a blood trail.

56
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,705
- Over there.
- It went that way!

57
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:15,075
- Goodness!
- Go after it.

58
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,576
My gosh.

59
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:24,315
What a disgrace!

60
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:27,526
- Let's go that way.
- My goodness.

61
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:28,886
Can you believe it?

62
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,476
Now, go.

63
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:56,315
If you follow this path,
your forest will appear.

64
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,456
A Eum.

65
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,786
I did not see you today.

66
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,406
Thank you.

67
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,336
I will repay you for
this no matter what.

68
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:34,686
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 10: DEJA-VU</font>

69
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,435
I found you.

70
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,766
I'll soon be coming for you,

71
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,706
so sit tight.

72
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,545
What's so funny?

73
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,105
The stage is almost complete.

74
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,175
- "The stage"?
- Thanks to the Spirit of Darkness,

75
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,146
I was able to find
out that Lee Yeon...

76
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,086
will never be able to
kill her in this life.

77
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,586
But is there a reason why
it has to be those two?

78
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:11,995
I was supposed to have it all.

79
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,966
I was meant to be the
mountain spirit...

80
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,666
and have that woman by my side.

81
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,896
- Are you saying...
- I'm going to take over...

82
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:20,935
the mountain spirit's body...

83
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,906
and have her become my wife.

84
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,786
Gosh, this place is mesmerizing.

85
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:49,726
Why aren't you
asking me anything?

86
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,666
Why aren't you asking
me why I betrayed you?

87
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,836
Don't you want to
know why I killed you?

88
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:01,675
On my way here,

89
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,745
I noticed that there
are many legends...

90
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,045
regarding this
beautiful waterfall.

91
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,545
It's about a married couple
who were madly in love.

92
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,586
But some stories say the wife dies
and some say the husband dies.

93
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,326
So I'm sure there's also
something I don't know...

94
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,365
about the Tale of
the Nine Tailed...

95
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:26,036
where the nine-tailed fox tragically
had to kill his first love.

96
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:49,826
A Eum.

97
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,226
Why did you shoot me?

98
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,466
This woman's body
is very useful.

99
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,365
Mountain spirits never
let their guard down,

100
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,065
but I was even able to
shoot you with an arrow.

101
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,576
Imoogi.

102
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:11,716
Long time no see, Yeon. I
waited for you for a long time.

103
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,485
- Where is A Eum?
- In here.

104
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:18,156
She willingly gave me her body
so she could save her father.

105
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:21,185
Come out from that body.

106
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:26,125
I forgot to tell you something.

107
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,195
That was an evening primrose
from the burial ground.

108
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,565
I told you to come out.

109
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,305
- She's mine.
- Show yourself!

110
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,386
Should I kill her
and leave her body?

111
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:01,166
She means nothing to me.

112
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,396
- I do not believe you.
- You think you used her as bait.

113
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,835
But don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

114
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,116
Don't kill me!

115
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,256
I don't want to die.

116
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:07,795
You promised me.

117
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,136
You promised to love
me until the day I die.

118
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,465
Yeon.

119
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:34,156
No...

120
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:39,356
A Eum.

121
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,425
Is that you?

122
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,805
Don't come near me!

123
00:10:58,646 --> 00:10:59,776
It's you.

124
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,646
I...

125
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,286
I killed the villagers.

126
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:14,325
I killed everyone.

127
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,295
It's not your fault.

128
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,465
Help me, Yeon.

129
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,036
Stop me from
hurting anyone else.

130
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,146
Stop me from hurting you.

131
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,616
Just kill me.

132
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:43,656
It's okay. You have me.

133
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,425
Everything will be all right.

134
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,506
This girl is pretty feisty.

135
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:09,215
You can't kill me, but you
can't keep me alive either.

136
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,195
What you want is me, right?

137
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,496
Take my body,

138
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:26,236
and let her go.

139
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:29,406
How touching.

140
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,545
Don't make me repeat myself.

141
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,746
Will you choose the body of a
mountain spirit or her body?

142
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:47,085
Fine. I'll let her go.

143
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,156
Instead,

144
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:51,856
give me your heart.

145
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,366
I heard the energy of
mountain spirits...

146
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:57,325
lies in their hearts.

147
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,236
Give me your heart.

148
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:04,106
A Eum.

149
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,475
You're listening, right?

150
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:14,715
Promise me one thing.

151
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,156
Promise me that you'll
forget about me.

152
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,055
Forget about me...

153
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:25,896
and live a long life.

154
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:38,935
You don't need to be sorry...

155
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:42,146
or grateful.

156
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,945
My life belongs to you anyway.

157
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,825
Who says you can die?

158
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,295
A Eum.

159
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,636
Let me go. I'm okay.

160
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,345
Yeon.

161
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,585
You asked me to forget you.

162
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:24,286
But I won't ask the same.

163
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:26,916
Don't forget me.

164
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,756
- What are you saying?
- I'll crawl out of my grave...

165
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:36,325
if you ever fall in
love with another woman.

166
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,396
Let go.

167
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,866
Repay what you owe me, Yeon.

168
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,335
No.

169
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,126
Please kill me.

170
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,626
See? I promised...

171
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:20,866
that I would...

172
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,935
protect you.

173
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,056
Thank you, Yeon,

174
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,425
for keeping your promise
not to forget me.

175
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,296
And...

176
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:27,636
I'm sorry...

177
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,005
for making you wait so long.

178
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,425
That's precious to you.

179
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,566
Because you are not
a shadow of my past.

180
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,765
I'll take...

181
00:17:58,195 --> 00:17:59,465
a good look at you.

182
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:02,636
Not A Eum reborn, but you.

183
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:29,925
You're here?

184
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,995
I thought you had died in
the Forest of the Starved.

185
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:36,136
Whatever. I'm disappointed.

186
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,535
Now?

187
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,076
Well, come or not. Whatever.

188
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,185
Are you all right? Should
I call Shin Ju back?

189
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,896
Stop freaking out. It's nothing.

190
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:03,896
It isn't the poison, is it?

191
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,836
Your life is expiring.

192
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,406
I'm right, aren't I?

193
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,205
I've lived pretty
long for a half fox.

194
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,306
Please eat the ground cherry.

195
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,576
You can steal years from people
and live for as long as you want.

196
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,275
Yeon is on his way here.

197
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,316
I'm going to tell
him who Imoogi is.

198
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,356
I'm the only one who
knows what he looks like.

199
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,656
What about you?

200
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,626
It's not like I've ever
dreamed of the future.

201
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,525
Don't do it! Please stop!

202
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,596
Why must you go that
far just for Yeon?

203
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,505
You can't tell Yeon.

204
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,906
Don't meet with Yeon.

205
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,846
Go see Imoogi and
ask him to save you.

206
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:53,015
Or tell me where they are.
I'll get you a ground cherry.

207
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:54,816
Yu Ri.

208
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,886
Why are you crying for me?

209
00:19:57,886 --> 00:19:59,316
It's infuriating!

210
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:00,556
I told you...

211
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,285
never to cry for another person.

212
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:05,826
Don't make your life a B-movie.

213
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:08,566
You said that I should be the
one that takes, not loses.

214
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,025
That's what you said to me...

215
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,535
when we first met, as you were
drenched in the zookeeper's blood.

216
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,336
You told me to live like that.

217
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:19,035
I tend to be fickle.

218
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,046
Stop sniffling, and go
buy me some naengmyeon.

219
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:27,816
I'm craving
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

220
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,695
I wish we could go
back to those days.

221
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,235
I can't remember how
the azaleas tasted...

222
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,705
back then.

223
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,156
Hey.

224
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:10,326
What are you so focused
on all day long?

225
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:12,455
I'm sure I've seen him before.

226
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,425
- Who?
- Ms. Nam's boyfriend.

227
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:19,765
Well, you are the best
at recognizing people.

228
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,535
What shows have
we done recently?

229
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,705
"The Gig Job Staircase",
"The Cursed Wedding Ring",

230
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,005
- "The Haunted..."
- Wait.

231
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:29,275
It was sometime around then.

232
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,505
This is driving
me mad. Who is he?

233
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,616
The red umbrella?

234
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:34,416
What do you mean?

235
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:38,116
You're right. The man
that you met that day...

236
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,126
is the red umbrella that
we had investigated.

237
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,435
What's wrong?

238
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,975
Am I not the person
you were waiting for?

239
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:13,015
Where did he go?

240
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,156
Yeon?

241
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:20,495
Do you know me?

242
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,366
Where's Rang?

243
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,195
I don't know. I stepped out, and
he wasn't here when I got back.

244
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:25,636
He won't answer
his phone either.

245
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,505
Seeing what a rude punk
you are, you must be her.

246
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,265
The necklace thief.
The dog owner.

247
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,175
The one with 99 points.

248
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:35,745
- What gibberish is that?
- Just something.

249
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:38,475
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

250
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,116
Don't eat that!
It's for Mr. Lee!

251
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,886
Naengmyeon tastes bad if
the noodles get soggy.

252
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:51,826
My gosh. You look so pale.

253
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,626
Will you keep a distance?

254
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:56,296
You smell like rotting corpses.

255
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,535
It's the scent of death.

256
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:01,535
Since I've lived much longer
than I should've, as have you.

257
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,035
Want one?

258
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:12,275
No thanks.

259
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,616
Do you plan to sacrifice
your life for your pride?

260
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:15,985
Is it worth it?

261
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,485
Do you think I'm desperate
to stay alive as you are?

262
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:19,955
Definitely not.

263
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:25,356
Then why do you look like
you don't want to go?

264
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,425
This is unlike you.

265
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,796
Get to your point.

266
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,796
Do you plan to defy our master?

267
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,406
He's "your" master,
not "our" master.

268
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,035
I know you're upset because of
what the Spirit of Darkness did.

269
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,735
But that was a misunderstanding.

270
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,606
You threw me into the Forest
of the Starved, but what?

271
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,316
A misunderstanding?

272
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:48,376
It was a risky move that
we took to catch Yeon.

273
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:51,086
We wouldn't have left you there.

274
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:52,985
Sorry,

275
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,556
but I can't bear to listen
to your lies anymore.

276
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,356
I'm sure you know that,
even in this state,

277
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:04,495
I can kill you no problem.

278
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,636
Wait. Wait a minute.

279
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:12,735
That's odd.

280
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:17,245
Your master should
show up by now.

281
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,546
Shall I take a guess?

282
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:27,856
Imoogi...

283
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:30,755
is not in this house right now.

284
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,265
That was good.

285
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,735
- What are you looking at?
- Get out. Scram.

286
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:05,856
All you have are ice cubes.

287
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:08,126
Is ice cream not
something you enjoy?

288
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:15,136
I can't believe he adopted
some rude pet from overseas.

289
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,366
I hate you, you know.

290
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,066
I never asked for your opinion.

291
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,205
Stay away from Mr. Lee.

292
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:23,806
- What if I don't?
- I'll kill you.

293
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,916
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Ki Yu Ri. Why?

294
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,116
I never asked for your name.

295
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,785
But you just asked.

296
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:33,255
You don't seem all
that smart to me.

297
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:35,056
Can you and Rang
even communicate?

298
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,485
- I'm smart, you know.
- As if.

299
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,695
Mr. Lee only adds mustard
to his naengmyeon,

300
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:43,066
gets blisters on his
lips after eating crabs,

301
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,195
and hates cucumbers in gimbap.

302
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,265
All you can name are
his eating habits.

303
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:51,166
But because of you... Because
of a jerk like you he...

304
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,876
You can't tell Yeon.

305
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:55,846
Go on.

306
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,675
Darn it. Just forget it.

307
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:12,195
You're laughing?

308
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,826
You can't kill me. You
shouldn't even think about it.

309
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:18,396
- What?
- I'm the one who saved you...

310
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,735
from the fatal wound
inflicted by Yeon.

311
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,666
What you owe me hasn't
been cleared yet.

312
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:07,376
Who on earth are you?

313
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:10,816
A passer-by who saw that
you were in grave danger.

314
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,116
As if.

315
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:16,086
I smell the stench of a
rotting corpse from you.

316
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:19,056
I'm a human who happened
to have prolonged his life.

317
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:20,856
Why did you save my life?

318
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,225
Does the reason truly matter?

319
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,366
All I want is for you to
return the favor one day.

320
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,465
I'm sure there will come a time.

321
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,326
You have a deal to abide by.

322
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:51,685
A fox can't go back
on the deal it made.

323
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,995
Thanks to me, you were
able to bring Imoogi back.

324
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,166
No, that was my doing.

325
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,066
All you added was
a bit of flair.

326
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:02,435
You approached me so that
you could use me someday...

327
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:05,775
knowing that Yeon
was my brother.

328
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:09,576
In what other way would
a half-fox be of any use?

329
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,245
Please consume
the ground cherry.

330
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:18,316
Live and return the
favor you owe me.

331
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,316
What do you want from me?

332
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:24,556
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

333
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,856
It's his body I need.

334
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,412
I should get going.

335
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,652
Yes, go ahead. So
long and farewell.

336
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:56,418
Rang talks about how
miserable his life has been,

337
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,089
but I guess it
wasn't all that bad.

338
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:04,799
Since you live to protect him,
please do so until the very end.

339
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:08,428
Give Rang this.

340
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,438
It's for the naengmyeon.

341
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,978
What on earth?

342
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,889
So let me summarize.

343
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:35,059
The man you're dating
is the suspect...

344
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,029
of that case we've
been investigating?

345
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:38,458
Not the suspect,
but the culprit.

346
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,498
Does he have a prior?

347
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,339
He's never been prosecuted,

348
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,039
but he's committed
similar crimes before.

349
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,039
And you're still dating him?

350
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:47,438
- Yes.
- Why?

351
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:51,109
Because he waited for
me to be reincarnated.

352
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:52,809
He's the first love
of my past life.

353
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,148
That's something we tell
stories about on our show.

354
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,178
Maybe it's a metaphor.

355
00:29:56,448 --> 00:29:59,289
She loves him so much to
the point to feel that way.

356
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:06,329
Do you think it's a coincidence
that the three of us met?

357
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,228
I believe fate
brought us together.

358
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,629
Fate, my foot. Cut the nonsense.

359
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,428
Just tell me why.
What's going on?

360
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,139
The two of you
could be in danger.

361
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:22,708
You're the people
closest to me...

362
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,748
in my past life and
in this one as well.

363
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:28,408
Are you still going on about
this past life nonsense?

364
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:30,648
You're both too well-educated to
be convinced with words alone.

365
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:36,319
So see for yourselves.

366
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:39,529
What's with the spectacles?

367
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:42,599
- It's a tiger's eyebrow.
- From the Korean folk tale?

368
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,998
That's right. Do
you have a mirror?

369
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:46,069
Unbelievable.

370
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:49,599
Here.

371
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:01,408
What... What?

372
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,988
Where are we going?

373
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:13,728
Someplace far from the palace.

374
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,958
Is it just you two?

375
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:17,829
Our apologies, Your Highness.

376
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,928
We promise to keep
you safe though.

377
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,148
Goodness.

378
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,688
- Only set one table from now on.
- Sorry?

379
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:45,789
We're no longer in the palace
which means no one's watching us.

380
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,158
Join me for meals.

381
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:49,198
- That's absurd...
- Comply with the order,

382
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,458
or I'll starve myself.

383
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:54,799
Your Highness!

384
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:57,468
Are you going somewhere?

385
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,408
Yes, out to get some fresh air.

386
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,809
- Don't think about following me.
- Just please stay away...

387
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,079
from the forest up north.

388
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,508
- Why?
- Rumor has it that...

389
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,309
a 1,000-year-old
fox lives there.

390
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:08,809
A fox?

391
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:12,819
Your Highness,

392
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,819
here you go. It's fish.

393
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,359
You have rice on your chin.

394
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:29,398
Your Highness!

395
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:32,398
- Ta-da.
- Goodness.

396
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,609
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

397
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:40,579
You should sit too.

398
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:43,279
That won't be necessary.

399
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,148
Come on and join us. Sit.

400
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:47,819
Go ahead. It's quite
pretty, you know.

401
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,359
It'll suit you well.

402
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,458
What...

403
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:04,938
This is our past life?

404
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,008
Is this for real or not?

405
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,709
Please tell me I've
been hypnotized.

406
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,818
Could this be VR goggles?

407
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,349
I just can't believe it.

408
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,789
If past lives do exist,

409
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,389
I reckoned I'd be a
princess, not you.

410
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,059
It's still better
than being a eunuch.

411
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:28,289
That little boy called
me a eunuch, remember?

412
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,658
- These are the same glasses.
- No way.

413
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,528
Being at this show for too long
must've messed with our heads.

414
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:35,869
So tell me.

415
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:37,968
I doubt you wanted to only
spread the shock around,

416
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,669
so why did you show us this?

417
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,309
The monster that's after me...

418
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,209
is a lot closer to
us than we think.

419
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:50,119
It might even be
someone we know.

420
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:53,718
I want to protect you guys...

421
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,709
just like how you protected
me in our past lives.

422
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:02,189
What about your boyfriend?

423
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:03,558
Who is he really?

424
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,399
Come inside.

425
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,169
Hello. This must be your first
time meeting a nine-tailed fox.

426
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,278
What's wrong? You
can't believe me?

427
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:23,319
They seemed a lot more
shocked than I expected.

428
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,819
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

429
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,988
I understand why they
can't seem to accept it.

430
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:31,359
Let me know if you need my help.
I'll just erase their memory.

431
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:34,988
Did you meet your brother?

432
00:34:35,558 --> 00:34:38,899
No, I think Imoogi got
to him faster than me.

433
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,229
I see.

434
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:43,598
He used the Spirit of
Darkness to keep an eye on us,

435
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:44,769
so he probably knew...

436
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:48,368
that Rang will become a ticking
bomb once he starts getting swayed.

437
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,109
I was hoping we'd
get to find a clue.

438
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:52,439
Don't be too disappointed.

439
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,979
I kind of expected
this to happen.

440
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:57,678
So I had a back-up plan ready.

441
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,479
Where were you?

442
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:30,078
I want to be alone.

443
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,678
Rang, you look...

444
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,359
Did you eat the ground cherry?

445
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:38,919
Please...

446
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,729
let me be alone.

447
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:44,229
Look over there.

448
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:46,868
Yeon came and left it for you.

449
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:07,848
I can't believe this.

450
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:24,899
Yes, sir.

451
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:27,468
What brings you to
call me at this hour?

452
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:30,269
I have a personal
favor to ask you.

453
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:32,569
You have a personal
favor to ask me?

454
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:35,808
I'll do anything for you, sir.

455
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,778
Yes, he'll go see you tomorrow.

456
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:40,749
Thank you.

457
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,388
Sleep tight.

458
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:09,339
What about Ms. Nam? Doesn't
she want fried chicken?

459
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,308
No, she must've been
tired. She's asleep.

460
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:12,908
Are you going to let her
stay here for a while?

461
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:16,149
Yes, this place is
safer as a basecamp.

462
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:19,488
Did you see him?

463
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:20,919
I didn't get to see Imoogi,

464
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:22,988
but I saw a middle-aged guy
taking Rang into the house.

465
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:25,919
He's probably the guy with a
criminal branding on his forehead.

466
00:38:26,058 --> 00:38:27,558
We know where he lives,
so that's good enough.

467
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:30,359
- Make sure you be careful.
- Okay.

468
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:35,399
Here you go.

469
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,448
Why do you always give
me the drumsticks?

470
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:48,609
Because they're drumsticks.

471
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:55,348
Thank you for the meal.

472
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:01,888
Thanks a lot.

473
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:04,058
For both this and the incident
with the Spirit of Darkness.

474
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,698
The people at the Samdo
River helped me out.

475
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:09,299
That granny...

476
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:11,999
never gives anyone
anything for free.

477
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,868
What did you have to give
her? What was the deal?

478
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:16,939
I signed a slave contract.

479
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,209
What?

480
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,948
I promised to sail ships
at the Samdo River.

481
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,479
I'll be in charge of taking
the dead to the Underworld.

482
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,519
Apparently, they're short of hands
because it's an aging society.

483
00:39:25,718 --> 00:39:26,888
But you get seasick.

484
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:28,988
I'll be working
there after I die.

485
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,319
I'm sure I won't get
seasick once I'm dead.

486
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:32,789
You do.

487
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,299
You know what? I'll have you
transferred to a desk job.

488
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,999
I'll bribe the upper management.

489
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:45,269
I'm going to count on you.

490
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,808
But just so you know, I still
have a long life to live.

491
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:54,808
You should hit things off with
that necklace thief before you die.

492
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:57,678
Will you please call her by
her beautiful name, Yu Ri?

493
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:00,848
Did you meet her?

494
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:03,058
Yes, she's a pretty
decent person.

495
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:21,609
You overslept.

496
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,008
Why do you look so startled?

497
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,549
You know who I am, right?

498
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:37,359
- Gosh, my stomach hurts.
- My stomach is killing me.

499
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:39,988
- Do you guys want some coffee?
- Yes, hurry.

500
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:52,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

501
00:40:59,308 --> 00:41:00,549
I feel like I'm in a nice cafe.

502
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:04,479
- It's sweet, isn't it?
- It tastes like a barista made it.

503
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,589
I'd ask for nothing more if
my life was just as sweet...

504
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,758
as this coffee.

505
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,419
Hey, about yesterday...

506
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:15,888
I looked everywhere
for you guys.

507
00:41:16,229 --> 00:41:17,999
Wrap it up and
come to the office.

508
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:20,098
Hurry.

509
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,198
Come on. Hurry.

510
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:23,598
Come inside.

511
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:24,769
What's the fuss?

512
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:26,769
Say hello.

513
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,769
He's our new intern.

514
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:31,039
I look forward to
working with you guys.

515
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:42,049
How did you find this place?

516
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:43,819
That's a business secret.
You don't need to know that.

517
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,558
I looked everywhere, but I
couldn't find it. Where is it?

518
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:48,428
I don't know.

519
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:50,999
I didn't even tell you
what I was looking for.

520
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,028
Everyone says that at first.

521
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:55,069
I really don't know.

522
00:41:58,468 --> 00:41:59,638
Didn't you hear the rumors?

523
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:03,678
People tend to tell me
things when they meet me.

524
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:05,238
What are you talking about?

525
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:06,578
Look.

526
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,049
It's a great day
to torture someone.

527
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:18,218
My name is Terry.

528
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:19,959
It sounds similar to Terrius.

529
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:22,258
It's easy to remember, right?
Did you say you were 22?

530
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:25,058
He goes to a university in
the US. He's an Ivy Leaguer.

531
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:26,569
Who helped you get
an intern job here?

532
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:29,569
- What?
- All the interns here...

533
00:42:29,638 --> 00:42:30,698
get their jobs
using connections.

534
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,508
And judging by how kind
the team manager is to you,

535
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:34,839
I'm guessing it's
someone very high up.

536
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:37,839
What's the matter with you?

537
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:40,278
She can be very feisty.

538
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:42,778
You need to be careful. It
gets worse when she's hungry.

539
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:45,348
He's not my dad, but my guardian
is an important figure...

540
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:46,388
in this industry.

541
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:47,549
He works in this industry?

542
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:49,189
Yes.

543
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:51,388
I like that you're honest.

544
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:54,488
My name is Nam Ji A.

545
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:06,539
It's nice to see
you guys get along.

546
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:07,939
My gosh, this is nice.

547
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:10,638
Be nice to him, okay?

548
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:12,678
Send me the documents
I asked for earlier.

549
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:21,118
By the way, have we met before?

550
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,319
I'm not sure.

551
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:37,169
Why can't I hear anything?

552
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:44,408
He may be an intern, but
he's pretty much our boss.

553
00:43:44,508 --> 00:43:45,578
Unbelievable.

554
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:48,879
I can't believe a guy
can be that handsome.

555
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:51,519
If I earn brownie points
from the president this time,

556
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,649
I will be the youngest
station director ever.

557
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:10,069
He has finally begun
to make his move.

558
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,569
The only way to
stop the calamity...

559
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,908
Is that child's
sacrifice the only way?

560
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,249
<font color="#00ff00">DEAD SOULS MANAGEMENT CENTER</font>

561
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:35,089
Shake, shake, shake.

562
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:37,528
Honey.

563
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:42,269
You know it's our wedding
anniversary. Did you forget again?

564
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:43,698
Do you even love me?

565
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:46,339
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

566
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:51,209
Look at the time.

567
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:54,549
Why didn't you answer the phone?

568
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,379
Why were you charging up a
storm with my credit card?

569
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:03,089
It's true. People do not change.

570
00:45:03,988 --> 00:45:07,658
Honey bear! Guess
what I brought!

571
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:13,028
But first, guess what I'm
holding behind my back.

572
00:45:13,028 --> 00:45:14,229
I'm not sure.

573
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,269
That hurts.

574
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,468
I said not to stray
from your duties.

575
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,339
No. I paid a lot for that.

576
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:27,109
Look at this hairdo.

577
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:28,948
Is the Afterlife a club?

578
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:31,718
Seriously.

579
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:34,089
Gosh.

580
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:46,868
I have a favor to ask you.

581
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:53,308
I'm willing to do anything now.

582
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:57,539
I'll do anything to save
both myself and that woman.

583
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:04,278
What can I do for you?

584
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:09,388
First, open Granny's
heart a little.

585
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:14,229
Open her heart?

586
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:18,129
I'm sure she knows...

587
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,129
how to get rid of Imoogi.

588
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:24,999
She has been worried to death
ever since Imoogi awoke.

589
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:26,738
She would've done something
if she knew the way.

590
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:31,638
It may require breaking
a forbidden law.

591
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:58,039
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A, TERRY</font>

592
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:21,888
Is there something on
the back of my head?

593
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:22,988
- No.
- No.

594
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:25,299
- Just say it.
- Well...

595
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:28,299
Are you even human?

596
00:47:28,669 --> 00:47:30,999
How could you be so
calm after what you saw?

597
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:32,698
What did she see?

598
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:36,109
- It's nothing.
- Are you being sassy with me?

599
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:38,939
It really is nothing.

600
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:42,008
If it's nothing,
tell me. What is it?

601
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:44,778
- Did you see the breaking news?
- Breaking news?

602
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,149
They found a mummy in
a construction site.

603
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,789
A mummy? Not in Egypt,
but in our country?

604
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,459
Terry. Let me see that.

605
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:54,589
Thanks.

606
00:47:58,528 --> 00:47:59,598
What...

607
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:02,468
My gosh. This looks
fun. This is great.

608
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:04,799
Hey. Jae Hwan. Get going.

609
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,238
- I have an interview in an hour.
- Get me a camera.

610
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,008
- I'll go.
- Okay.

611
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:12,778
May I go as well?

612
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:18,348
Listen up, intern.

613
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:20,789
This isn't training.
This is the real deal.

614
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:24,019
It may be a blurb in your resume,
but this is our occupation.

615
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:27,028
If you get in the way
of the investigation...

616
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:28,129
Fire me.

617
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:31,028
I'm going to check the camera.

618
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:36,368
Where did you learn
how to use the camera?

619
00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,138
I taught myself. I'm not sure if
I'm good enough for you though.

620
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,939
- Can you film it?
- Yes.

621
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:45,479
Even dead bodies?

622
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,908
- I have to film dead bodies?
- Yes.

623
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:50,948
To be honest, I'm
not sure I can.

624
00:48:51,718 --> 00:48:52,718
Why not?

625
00:48:53,689 --> 00:48:55,948
I don't think the
deceased will welcome it.

626
00:48:59,058 --> 00:49:01,528
- What do you mean?
- Whatever the reason may be,

627
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:05,399
I think I'd be sad if my death was
being displayed to strangers...

628
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:07,729
through a camera.

629
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:13,939
- You're qualified.
- Excuse me?

630
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:17,479
People whose curiosity comes
first when they see dead people...

631
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:19,479
aren't qualified to be a
cameraman in my opinion.

632
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,749
Does that mean I pass?

633
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:24,218
You pass.

634
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,519
- Why are you smiling?
- Because I'm happy.

635
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,118
About what?

636
00:49:30,658 --> 00:49:31,718
Because I like you.

637
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:48,802
You're looking for your cat,
right? A female Russian Blue.

638
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:51,342
Go to the bathroom
behind Soobyung Park.

639
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,912
I heard from stray cats in
the area, so it's reliable.

640
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:56,742
You can send the 200 dollars
of finder's fee to my account.

641
00:49:56,742 --> 00:49:57,881
Hello?

642
00:49:58,751 --> 00:49:59,851
Darn it.

643
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,151
Hey.

644
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:06,651
What brings you here?

645
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,270
I wanted to drink,
but no bars were open.

646
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,809
- Drink?
- Forget it if you don't want to.

647
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,539
What's your problem?

648
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:21,150
Anastasia was waiting for you.

649
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,550
Don't act like we're close.

650
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:28,349
Why are you laughing?

651
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,920
She wants to join us since
you have beef jerky in there.

652
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,400
How did you know that?

653
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,329
I'll give you a
doggy jerky treat.

654
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:47,539
Hey. Hi Yeon.

655
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:59,449
That punk is so dejected.

656
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,170
<font color="#00ff00">LEE RANG</font>

657
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:23,780
Look who's here.

658
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,780
I came to ask you something.

659
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:28,150
Let me ask you something first.

660
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,650
Tell me. What do you think I am?

661
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,889
- What else?
- Answer me.

662
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,800
Master of Samdo River between the
Living Realm and the Afterlife.

663
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,630
With your insight, you can...

664
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:48,829
Wrong.

665
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,199
When was it?

666
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:57,780
When asked the same question at
that very spot, Yeon said this.

667
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,079
"I hope you get
rheumatoid arthritis."

668
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,050
Show yourself.

669
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:07,920
Darn it.

670
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:15,690
Did you think that little
trick would work on me?

671
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:17,030
I thought maybe it would.

672
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:20,730
You've picked up bad habits
from your big brother.

673
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,070
Yeon doesn't do disguises.

674
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,170
He thinks it's ignoble.

675
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:29,170
Both the before and
after are annoying faces.

676
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:31,579
But I am curious.

677
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,809
Why did this fugitive fox...

678
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:38,949
come voluntarily to
this dangerous place?

679
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,090
Should I send you
to the Underworld?

680
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:45,289
Let me go today.

681
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:47,829
I'm way on top of
the list anyway.

682
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:48,960
Hey!

683
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:51,159
You punks.

684
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:52,929
The Underground isn't
some restaurant...

685
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:54,329
you can swing by whenever
you feel like it.

686
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,230
It doesn't scare me.

687
00:52:57,969 --> 00:52:59,099
Why would it...

688
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,340
when your brother will
be accompanying you?

689
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:06,340
What's wrong? Isn't it what
you've desired for so long?

690
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,719
You desperately wanted to
end your brother's life.

691
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:17,420
Of course, you would
know everything.

692
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:21,530
Since you know, I'll
be straight with you.

693
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,130
I wish to break a deal.

694
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,929
Why did you save my life?

695
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:28,869
All I want is for you to
return the favor one day.

696
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:32,340
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

697
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,440
It's his body I need.

698
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:56,090
There's a reason...

699
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,429
why the Almighty shackled
you to one rule...

700
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:02,099
while giving you the power
humans can never dream to have.

701
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,070
It's because he despised
those arrogant as you...

702
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,509
who would end up trying
to dominate humans.

703
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,009
You can swear at me all you want
as long as there's a way around it.

704
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,449
Well, there is.

705
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:22,289
What is it?

706
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
Die.

707
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:29,289
Only the fox's death...

708
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:32,300
can break a deal made by a fox.

709
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:45,880
Rather than thinking
about breaking the deal,

710
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,650
think of a way to
untangle the mess.

711
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:51,219
- What?
- Keep in mind...

712
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,219
that all deals follow
the rule of quid pro quo.

713
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,199
The fact that Mr. Lee
could die scares me.

714
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,039
I have no friends and no family.

715
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:15,469
I have no one.

716
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,210
What are you talking about?
You have Anastasia...

717
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,940
and also me.

718
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:29,650
If it weren't for Mr. Lee, I
would've been put to death...

719
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,259
at that unlicensed zoo.

720
00:55:31,889 --> 00:55:35,030
Kids banging on the glass
kept me up during the day...

721
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,300
and ticks irritated me at night to
the point that I couldn't sleep.

722
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:41,469
I kept shedding fur,
the food was awful,

723
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,670
and the zookeeper
physically abused me.

724
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:46,170
What? Where on
earth is that place?

725
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,170
I'll skin him and eat
him alive if I could.

726
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:51,340
How dare he beat you!

727
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,009
Are you drunk?

728
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,349
What?

729
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,150
- Sorry about that.
- Why are you apologizing?

730
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:03,750
I prefer the rougher
you, you know.

731
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:06,159
- Really?
- Yes.

732
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,530
Just so you know, my
nickname used to be CF.

733
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,429
- "Crazy Fox."
- Really? You?

734
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,329
I lost all three of my sisters
to a trap set by humans...

735
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,840
and that made me lose it.

736
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,940
Tell me more in detail.

737
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,440
Hunters, woodcutters, salt
merchants, and many others.

738
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,809
I'd bewitch everyone I saw.

739
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,150
You have no idea how many
died after losing their minds.

740
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,949
You're more of a
scumbag than I am.

741
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:33,920
I escaped the mountain
spirit I served...

742
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,259
to save my life and ended
up in Mr. Lee's forest.

743
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,789
- And?
- The former spirit yelled...

744
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:42,329
and demanded to
send me back to him,

745
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,599
but Mr. Lee Yeon said this.

746
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,429
What's with the yelling?

747
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,670
No way. What enters my
forest belongs to me.

748
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,770
That's when I decided...

749
00:56:55,469 --> 00:56:57,340
to serve Mr. Lee.

750
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,710
That's how I ended up training
in the medical field and...

751
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,949
How about we sleep together?

752
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:03,550
- What?
- Sleep with me.

753
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,250
I especially love that
messy past of yours.

754
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:11,920
There are a few steps
in a relationship.

755
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,530
You either ask someone
out on a date first...

756
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,460
or ask them to be your
boyfriend or girlfriend.

757
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:23,170
I'd rather skip all that.

758
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,840
Never in my life have I seen
a body like this before.

759
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:31,639
I couldn't sleep at all...

760
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:33,440
due to the images that kept
flashing before my eyes.

761
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:35,980
- Is it a real mummy?
- See it for yourself.

762
00:57:37,449 --> 00:57:40,020
Hey, you. No filming.

763
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,119
The corpse is too dry to get
a viable fingerprint anyway.

764
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,960
We need to know the details...

765
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,619
if we want people to
call us with tips.

766
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,460
When have I ever published
anything without your permission?

767
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,230
The disappearance of all
those island people...

768
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Okay, fine.

769
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:06,780
Has the body been
drained of blood?

770
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:09,449
Think of a tree that's been
drained of all its sap.

771
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,920
No visible trauma.

772
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:15,690
She was found at a
construction site?

773
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,259
The workers found her...

774
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:19,489
and it seems like no one
bothered to bury her.

775
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,259
So it wasn't put
there to be hidden...

776
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:24,599
but to be put on display?

777
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,099
What if she died
by a natural cause?

778
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,099
There's a chance that
she could've died...

779
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,099
of dehydration at an
abandoned construction site.

780
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:35,039
A body that died of
natural causes...

781
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:36,909
was once found in
Gyeonggi Province in 2002.

782
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:39,440
I remember that. The lady
from the Papyong Yoon clan?

783
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,579
The lady from the
Papyong Yoon clan...

784
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,579
was buried under stone that
was as think as concrete.

785
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:46,320
The stone sealed the
grave from air getting in.

786
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,190
The body didn't decay because
the air had been removed.

787
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,360
This couldn't have happened if
the body was exposed to air...

788
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,230
like at the construction site.

789
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,190
Are you saying someone
did this to her?

790
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,239
What are you staring at?

791
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,349
This looks familiar.

792
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:17,619
These nails...

793
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,969
Detective Baek, I
should get going.

794
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:41,840
- Just like that?
- Hand him everything else...

795
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,039
you have on the body.

796
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:44,840
Hold on. Ji A!

797
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:20,039
Do you perhaps know the woman
who wore this fake nail?

798
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,219
Did you see it too?

799
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:30,020
The body that is all skin.

800
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:32,659
Astonishing, isn't it?

801
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,000
What on earth are you?

802
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,869
What do I look like to you?

803
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:57,650
Seogyeong Traitor.

804
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,050
Signs of human
branding was present.

805
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,989
"Seo" as in west and
"Gyeong" as in Seoul.

806
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:08,829
You're the one who
took my parents!

807
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,079
This is the carnation
I folded for them.

808
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,639
See what's on the back.

809
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,546
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

810
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,789
Ji A, why won't you save us?

811
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,090
Are they alive?

812
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,960
Where?

813
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,000
Bring me the mountain spirit and
I'll return your parents to you.

814
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,420
I told you to sit
tight, didn't I?

815
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:31,040
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

816
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,710
You haven't changed at all.
You're still very arrogant.

817
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,849
You must think you have
the world at your feet.

818
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:46,280
I don't know about anything else,
but I do think that way about you.

819
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:48,119
You make me want
to trample on you.

820
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,349
Your brother, your woman,

821
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:52,489
and the life of her parents.

822
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:54,630
I have control over them all.

823
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:56,829
What do you have?

824
01:03:58,159 --> 01:03:59,599
Let me make a reasonable offer.

825
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,199
Yeon, if you give up your body,
I will let everyone else live.

826
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,509
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

827
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,210
<i>Your woman and the
life of her parents.</i>

828
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,909
<i>I have control over them all.</i>

829
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:49,349
<i>Is there a way to take out
what's inside Ji A's body?</i>

830
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,710
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

831
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,650
<i>I want to kill him.</i>

832
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:55,320
<i>What am I to you?</i>

833
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,420
<i>You got abandoned again.</i>

834
01:04:57,719 --> 01:04:58,719
<i>I want to live.</i>

835
01:04:58,989 --> 01:05:01,690
<i>So how about you help
me out and just die?</i>

836
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,929
<i>I'm going to put an end
to this exhausting fight.</i>
