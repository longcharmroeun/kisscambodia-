1
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:12,027
Does it not hurt anymore?

2
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:15,828
Look at me.

3
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,937
Long time no see, Yeon.

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,937
Long time no see, Yeon.

5
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:33,478
She's mine.

6
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:34,708
She's mine.

7
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:45,257
How does it feel?

8
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,698
After a whole 600 years,

9
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:52,227
you face your enemy through
the body of the woman you love.

10
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:53,668
Ji A...

11
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:57,238
Where is she?

12
00:00:57,897 --> 00:01:00,308
Right here. She lies inside me.

13
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,308
She screams in agony...

14
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,948
while resenting her
inevitable fate.

15
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,278
Let me ask you this, then.

16
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:10,448
Who was the other guy...

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,588
and what exactly are you?

18
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:15,918
This is all your doing.

19
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,888
If you had let her be
sacrificed in the island's well,

20
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:24,258
we would've stayed as one,
not be split into two.

21
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,198
Though when the times
comes, we'll unite.

22
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:33,067
And when exactly
will that happen?

23
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,207
When we jump into
your body instead.

24
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,918
What's with your
obsession over my body?

25
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,588
Why can't you unite in another's
and live happily ever after?

26
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,088
Are you not aware of
the speed it grows?

27
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:52,858
Could it be...

28
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:55,728
that you not only grow,

29
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,398
but also age as fast?

30
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,498
That's the curse laid on you.

31
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:07,508
I came across one opportunity
to change my fate.

32
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,608
By becoming a dragon?

33
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,948
If I had,

34
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,378
I'd have been the spirit
of Baekdudaegan, not you.

35
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,218
So what you want is revenge.

36
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:21,818
That's why out of all
the immortal bodies,

37
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:23,788
you're after mine.

38
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:28,128
Just so you know, now
that I'm finally dominant,

39
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,128
she'll soon fade away.

40
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:32,198
- I'll kill you.
- If you do,

41
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:33,698
she'll die too.

42
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,168
And saving her will
lead to your death.

43
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,478
Will you save her
or save yourself?

44
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:50,647
I hate to tell you this,

45
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,547
but none of the above
is what we want.

46
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,128
Yap all you want.

47
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,797
I won't let you touch this body.

48
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:19,448
You're weak.

49
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,277
What?

50
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,047
Does it weaken you to
be dominant in her body?

51
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,888
Most of the Imoogi's strength
and abilities lie with him.

52
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,788
You're only the
heart, so to speak.

53
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,688
That's why you need
Ji A as your shield...

54
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,557
to prevent me from
knowing how weak you are.

55
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:44,168
You two can't change
the inevitable.

56
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:50,577
With you gone, it'll
be over. Just you.

57
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,017
And you're the only
one I need, Ji A.

58
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:01,017
Please.

59
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,117
Just give up that
body of yours and die.

60
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:17,838
Ji A,

61
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,637
I know you can hear me.

62
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,208
I know you're there.

63
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,908
Shut it.

64
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:28,247
Come back to me.

65
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:33,018
I'll always be waiting for you,

66
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,817
so come back to me.

67
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:41,627
I'll always be waiting for you.

68
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,398
I've been waiting for you too.

69
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,567
When it comes to waiting,
no one can do it better.

70
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,937
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

71
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,377
I had a feeling that
I could meet you here.

72
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,307
I'll always be by your side.

73
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:07,148
I'm yours till death do us part.

74
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,297
Yeon...

75
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:47,588
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

76
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:56,468
Help me, Yeon.

77
00:05:58,398 --> 00:05:59,908
Just kill me instead.

78
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,677
So that I never hurt you.

79
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,387
Ji A, it's all right.

80
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:21,757
It'll all be all right.

81
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:30,997
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 13: THE OTHER IMOOGI</font>

82
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:39,677
Dr. Koo, thank you for
today. You saved us.

83
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,348
Thank Mr. Lee Yeon, not me.

84
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:43,978
Take care then, guys.

85
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,387
Mr. Lee!

86
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:52,127
I'll be right there.

87
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:59,427
Yeon or the Imoogi, none
of them matter to me.

88
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,067
All I need are the
ground cherries.

89
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,468
Just the ground cherries!

90
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:05,367
Hey, there.

91
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,778
One shouldn't be so rough
in the driver's seat.

92
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:15,547
- Who are you?
- The name's Hyeonuiong.

93
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,848
I'm here to retrieve
the ground cherries.

94
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,817
Who sent you? Imoogi? Lee Yeon?

95
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,358
How's that of importance?

96
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,358
What matters is that this
doesn't belong to you.

97
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:25,458
Stop talking nonsense.

98
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,297
The ground cherries
are mine. They're mine!

99
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,598
Gosh, that hurt so much.

100
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,127
I hate the smell of gunpowder.

101
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:40,307
Listen to me. You shouldn't
fight against fate.

102
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,807
What? Are you also a monster?

103
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,078
My goodness.

104
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,377
It looks like we'll
meet again pretty soon.

105
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:00,927
Mr. Lee.

106
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,367
<font color="#00ff00">SHIN JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

107
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:41,428
So right now, she's
Director Nam, right?

108
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,108
But who knows when she might turn
into Imoogi and attack you again?

109
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,367
I let him hurt me.

110
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:52,137
What?

111
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,877
I wanted to check.

112
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,987
The fact that Imoogi split
into two could be his strength,

113
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:07,027
but it could also
be a fatal weakness.

114
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,688
What do you mean?

115
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,257
The Imoogi inside Ji A's body...

116
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,968
is a little different from
the one I've seen until now.

117
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,997
They're both the same Imoogi
but a little different?

118
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:18,867
This one is a lot more similar
to the Imoogi from my past life.

119
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,007
What can I do to help?

120
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:26,407
Go meet the Snail Bride and ask
her about the fortune teller.

121
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,548
The guy who took the fox bead?

122
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:38,257
Should I turn them
back into humans?

123
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:43,897
Check the list and turn only those
who still have lives left to live.

124
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:45,598
It'll be tiring to turn them
all into humans at once.

125
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,328
Okay, got it. But
let's eat first.

126
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:50,037
Honey, should I
buy you tteokbokki?

127
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,497
How about I add some
fritters and sundae as well?

128
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:53,938
I also want extra cheese.

129
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,637
Okay, I'll add extra
mozzarella cheese.

130
00:09:57,637 --> 00:09:59,877
And as for spiciness, I'll
order level three for you,

131
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,078
and I'll get myself a level one.

00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,407
I stabbed you with
my own hands...

145
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:07,678
and hurt you.

146
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:16,757
I know better than anyone
that it wasn't you.

147
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:22,058
Look at me.

148
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,968
How do you feel? Are you okay?

149
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,208
How could you possibly
be worried about me...

150
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,907
when you were the
one who got hurt?

151
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:39,277
Want some coffee?

152
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,017

No.

154
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,617
Do you want me to take you home?

155
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,458
I don't think I can go home.

156
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:56,897
What if I change
like I did earlier...

157
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,897
and hurt my parents?

158
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,137
Then I might really go crazy.

159
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:16,147
Then should we go
somewhere instead?

160
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,127
Yes, let's go somewhere.

161
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:32,468
Let's go to a place where
it'll just be the two of us.

162
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,507
Don't worry too much
about your parents.

163
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,667
I told Shin Ju to
keep an eye on them.

164
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:44,708
Thank you.

165
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:51,747
Where are we going?

166
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:53,887
Wherever.

167
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,737
Do you remember
when we first met?

168
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,877
When you were a little kid?

169
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:18,808
No.

170
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,678
Of course, I remember.

171
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:25,117
All my life, my job was
to chase after people.

172
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,757
You were the first person
to chase after me instead.

173
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,958
I should've just
asked you out then.

174
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,897
Then we would've been able
to enjoy our time together...

175
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,767
for a lot longer.

176
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,517
Darn it!

177
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,428
Were you going somewhere?

178
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:21,637
Forgive me. I
must've been crazy.

179
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,678
I was blinded by the ground
cherries. I was out of my mind!

180
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:26,247
Look at me.

181
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,688
You were born as a servant
in a filthy thatched house.

182
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:36,757
And you've come a
long way since then.

183
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,328
It's... It's all thanks to you.

184
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:43,997
I saved you right before you were
about to get executed for treason.

185
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:46,928
Yes, how will I ever forget?

186
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,098
Then...

187
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:51,667
why did you help Lee Yeon?

188
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,877
I heard you told
him a lot of stuff.

189
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,117
Please... Please show me mercy
and give me another chance.

190
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,247
No, there's no need.

191
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,787
I no longer need...

192
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,157
anything or anyone.

193
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:16,558
There's been a change of plans.

194
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:17,958
Pardon?

195
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,737
I want you to become miserable.

196
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,438
And I mean, every single
person who's alive right now.

197
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,478
Go and turn yourself in.

198
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,757
You're better off
living as a criminal.

199
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:54,728
Should we play a game?

200
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:57,338
What game?

201
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:01,637
Like you said earlier, let's
pretend like we don't know anything.

202
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,708
How exactly?

203
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:09,277
You're just an average person
who's bored of your dull...

204
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,448
and ordinary life.

205
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,917
And as for me,

206
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,517
let's say I'm not
a nine-tailed fox.

207
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,157
Do we know each other?

208
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:21,627
We're...

209
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,157
married. We're a married couple.

210
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,428
We're just an average couple.

211
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,037
Let's say you went
to work as usual,

212
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,867
and I'm waiting for you to
come home as I cook dinner.

213
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,667
- What do you think?
- So I'm the breadwinner?

214
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,608
I own tons of buildings
and have a lot of cash.

215
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,777
I just want to be a house husband
who gets paid rent every month.

216
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:44,178
Don't laugh. Try being serious.

217
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:45,818
What do you want me to do?

218
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,917
Just a second.

219
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,017
Wait here for a moment.

220
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,468
Okay, now come home from work.

221
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,068
Go on. Come home from work.

222
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,937
Gosh, this feels stupid.

223
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,417
I'm home.

224
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,447
Honey.

225
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,788
"Honey, I'm home"?

226
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,157
Is my little puppy mad?

227
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,788
Why are you mad?

228
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,828
Look at the time.

229
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:34,568
You always say it's normal for
a woman to come home late...

230
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,098
because you're
out there working.

231
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,268
Did you or did you not promise
to be home by midnight?

232
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,568
Did you promise me or not?

233
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,367
- Do I have a curfew?
- Yes.

234
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,108
You broke curfew
twice last month too.

235
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:45,808
Are promises to me unimportant?

236
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:48,907
I did, didn't I? Can you
forgive me just this once?

237
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,417
This just won't do. Take a seat.

238
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,687
Sit. Let's talk.

239
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,457
Honey. You finally got
sober not long ago.

240
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:03,427
Me?

241
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,268
You're creating the
background story too.

242
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,838
Darling, you've changed.

243
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:12,637
Do you even love me?

244
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:16,377
I love you.

245
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:23,147
Me too.

246
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,447
Are we making up now?

247
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:29,818
Of course. Our
fights never last...

248
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,588
more than five minutes.

249
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:40,867
It's not fair.

250
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:45,738
Why can't we even have an
ordinary life like this?

251
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,137
It's so unfair.

252
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:03,417
It would've been so nice...

253
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:06,088
if you were human...

254
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,727
and we were really married...

255
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,927
If Imoogi never existed...

256
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:18,738
If we lived in a
world like that...

257
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,008
If I had met you like that...

258
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,018
I'll protect you.

259
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,018
No matter what happens...

260
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:46,328
when this fight ends,
you must stay alive.

261
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:51,528
That's good enough for me.

262
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,278
Regardless of how many
times I am reborn,

263
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,907
the world is filled
with darkness.

264
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,288
Yeon, I'll show you...

265
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:17,217
what the world I live in
looks like at the end.

266
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:45,278
<font color="#00ff00">TERRY</font>

267
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:56,328
Hello?

268
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,758
A party will begin.

269
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,467
I don't plan to be
nice to you anymore.

270
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,167
Just wait.

271
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:08,808
I pity you.

272
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:13,207
You've never learned how
to give or receive love.

273
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:16,207
All you know how to do is
threaten people like this.

274
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:17,848
As you say, I am
threatening you.

275
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,588
Because your body will
be a ticking time bomb.

276
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:23,358
Look at yourself.

277
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,397
Soon, that will take full
control over your body.

278
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:43,538
When that time comes, you will
kill Yeon with your own hands.

279
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:19,808
Have you lost your mind?

280
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:25,647
Why are you going
through my computer?

281
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:29,818
What are you thinking? Why are
you messing with when she dies?

282
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,457
She's the real thing.

283
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:36,457
The real Imoogi.

284
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:38,427
What do you mean?

285
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,667
The real Imoogi is
within her body.

286
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,937
We must get rid of that in order to
get rid of the one running rampant.

287
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:49,108
You plan to sacrifice an
innocent child to catch Imoogi?

288
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,338
Knowing what she means to Yeon?

289
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,608
I do. I know better than anyone.

290
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:56,617
- So how could you?
- That's why I'm doing it.

291
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,417
Yeon can never let her die.

292
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,348
Imoogi knows that as well.

293
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:03,788
What do you think will happen...

294
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:05,288
if it takes over Yeon's body?

295
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:07,858
You'll kill a person because of
something that didn't happen yet?

296
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,528
What are you trying to
protect by doing that?

297
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:13,798
This is my job!

298
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:15,768
Because of that same reason,

299
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:19,738
our son lost his wife,
and we lost our son.

300
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:23,778
You added her name to the
list of the dead then too.

301
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,308
Thanks to that,

302
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,477
our son took his own life,

303
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,818
and we couldn't
save his soul yet.

304
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,518
Thanks to that, we
prevented a pandemic.

305
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:35,447
Bok Gil can't even
be reincarnated!

306
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:44,157
That was...

307
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:46,897
his fate.

308
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,838
You know, I thought you
had changed a little...

309
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:52,897
after losing your
child like that.

310
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:57,008
But I was wrong. You
haven't changed at all.

311
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,548
A much greater
calamity will come.

312
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:03,278
- If we don't stop it now...
- Fine.

313
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:05,177
You stop the calamity.

314
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:08,217
I'll stop you.

315
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:12,217
What are you trying to do?

316
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,028
The moment you change
the date that she dies,

317
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,758
it's over between us.

318
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:59,937
I write this as I
watch you sleep.

319
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:04,207
I've decided to return to Seoul.

320
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:10,078
The conclusion I made after
spending a night here is this.

321
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,088
No matter how far we run,

322
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,657
we can't escape.

323
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,568
I'm on the beach.

324
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,437
Let's walk together.

325
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:35,568
Let's walk to the end of the
beach and go back together.

326
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,407
I'm small and powerless.

327
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:45,877
The weight of my destiny
is too much to bear.

328
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:50,117
I feel like I'll sink to
the bottom of that ocean.

329
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:56,427
But Yeon, you push
me up like a buoy.

330
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:59,197
You make me float.

331
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,167
You make sure I don't sink.

332
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:17,117
I vowed to give her...

333
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:21,248
the gift of a boring...

334
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:25,457
and warm life...

335
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,788
that normal people live,

336
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:30,957
but down by the beach,

337
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:33,897
this is how she replied.

338
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:36,937
"Not alone."

339
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,838
She wishes to die together...

340
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:42,508
and live together.

341
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:45,907
However,

342
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:49,377
that seems to be a promise...

343
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,248
I can't make.

344
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:01,487
Save Mr. Lee.

345
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:04,086
I tried everything,
but to no avail.

346
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:05,856
Why should I?

347
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,227
Why must I help you?

348
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:12,927
Because I stabbed
him on your command.

349
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,197
This is your responsibility too.

350
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,737
What do you think I even am?

351
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,536
The owner of the
ground cherry tree.

352
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:21,836
You don't scare me.

353
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,276
And you mean that.

354
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:28,576
Still, shouldn't a deal
be beneficial to me too?

355
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,977
You don't seem to have
anything to offer,

356
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:35,687
and this half-breed
is useless to me now.

357
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:44,657
Take my life in
exchange for his.

358
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,157
Are you sure?

359
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:48,967
Just a second.

360
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:56,667
Mr. Lee, I'll no
longer be with you now,

361
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,536
but I wish you a long life.

362
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:02,546
Don't skip your meals
and put on some weight.

363
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:05,477
Stop chasing after
your brother too.

364
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:10,116
Just a little.

365
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:13,187
I hope you find a
little more happiness.

366
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:22,767
Kill me.

367
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,806
Don't stall. That's
even more annoying!

368
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,846
Open your eyes.

369
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,187
Consider your request granted.

370
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:43,217
However,

371
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:45,786
you're coming with me.

372
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:54,667
When the Imoogi in
her calls for you,

373
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,497
you will become my soldier.

374
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:09,707
Stay in places like
that for too long...

375
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:12,046
and the darkness will
swallow you whole.

376
00:30:35,357 --> 00:30:37,798
How may I help you?

377
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:39,197
I'm here to turn myself in.

378
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:40,738
Sorry?

379
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,538
I'm here to turn myself in.

380
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:45,738
I killed her.

381
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:47,377
Killed whom?

382
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:50,177
The mummified victim you found.

383
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:53,008
Are you for real?

384
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:54,818
There are four more.

385
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,217
Search my car's GPS history,

386
00:30:57,387 --> 00:31:00,687
and you'll find the burial
sites for all victims.

387
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:03,217
- Check it out.
- Sure.

388
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:05,857
What's your motive?

389
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:08,228
Why would the head of a
broadcasting station...

390
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:11,667
All I wanted was longevity.

391
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:16,238
If you had been in my shoes,

392
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:19,008
you would've made
the same choice.

393
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,478
Want me to go in with you?

394
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:30,318
No.

395
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:34,917
I want to properly draw a picture
of my parents' faces inside my head.

396
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:40,528
- If anything happens to me...
- That'll never happen.

397
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:47,167
Still, go ahead, if
that's how you feel.

398
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:50,808
Don't worry though.

399
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,578
It only surfaces when
it senses danger.

400
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,048
Or when it detects blood.

401
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:13,588
Come to think of it...

402
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,598
Long time no see, Yeon.

403
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,667
The scales are slowly
replacing my skin.

404
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:29,838
It might not be long before...

405
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:32,348
I lose myself completely.

406
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,197
Well, I'm off to
see the Snail Bride.

407
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:58,107
Bring my part-timers
over to my place later.

408
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:00,478
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan?

409
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,087
Yu Ri... Where's Yu Ri?

410
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:14,587
She left with that scary man.

411
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,257
She won't ever be back.

412
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,898
What did the fortune teller
say? Did you look into it?

413
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,907
I've been asking my contacts.

414
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:34,308
He didn't seem like
some lowly spirit.

415
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,237
Who is this geezer?

416
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:37,648
Well,

417
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,617
this seems to be a
groundless rumor,

418
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:44,617
but one of the
Afterlife judges...

419
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:48,558
is said to leave his
post once in a while.

420
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,098
That's interesting.

421
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,797
Anyway, let me know if you
find out anything about him.

422
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:04,007
- Here.
- What is this?

423
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,067
What is all this?

424
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,907
I was never able to buy you
anything with the money I earned.

425
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,447
It's been eating away at me.

426
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:14,547
When did you find the time...

427
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:16,817
out of your busy
schedule to buy this?

428
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,447
Gosh, it's pretty.

429
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:20,887
How nice.

430
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,018
Try it on.

431
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:26,487
I don't want to wear it out.

432
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:29,527
Our daughter bought this...

433
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,027
with the money she
worked hard to earn.

434
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,668
Wearing it out is
how we thank her.

435
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,637
Go ahead and try it on.

436
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,538
Should I?

437
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,898
This isn't the way home.

438
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:03,458
Give me five minutes.

439
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:07,967
Is it that good? Is it?

440
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,067
Yu Ri!

441
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,308
What brings you by at this hour?

442
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:26,248
That was unexpected.

443
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:27,418
It's my goodbye.

444
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:30,558
We're breaking up.

445
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:36,358
- What do you mean?
- Shin Ju, you were just dumped.

446
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:40,197
So don't wait for
me any longer...

447
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:41,598
and don't come looking for me.

448
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:43,668
Did I do something wrong?

449
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:44,808
No, I'm just tired of you.

450
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,108
- I get bored easily, you see.
- No.

451
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,777
That's not who you are.

452
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,348
Though it takes a while,

453
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,248
you offer up your heart
once the road to it opens.

454
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:57,617
Though you act cold, you
are the kindest of them all.

455
00:35:57,617 --> 00:35:59,788
- As if you know me well.
- I do.

456
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,317
- How you treat Rang and the dog...
- Enough with Mr. Nice Guy.

457
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:06,228
I hate how you patronize me...

458
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:07,858
about needing
friends and family.

459
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:11,367
Your dowdy looks and
that constant smile?

460
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:12,898
I hate them all.

461
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,808
I won't patronize you.

462
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:23,078
I'll buy and wear whatever
you tell me to wear.

463
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:24,478
I won't smile if you
don't want me to.

464
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:25,878
Will you please stop?

465
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:29,078
I hate you, okay?
I don't like you!

466
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,547
You're lying.

467
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,688
I don't want you
clinging onto me either.

468
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:46,767
I'll be off now.

469
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:51,407
I can't break up with you.

470
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:54,708
- Let me go.
- No, I'll never let go.

471
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,048
I won't let go until you
take back what you just said.

472
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:02,617
Shin Ju.

473
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:07,258
You're making me get sick
of you by acting like this.

474
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:12,088
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:17,298
I'm sorry for whatever it is
that made you feel this way...

476
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:30,807
Don't follow me.

477
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,918
Will you please just
disappear from my life?

478
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:04,508
She told me I act too nice.

479
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:08,978
She doesn't like how I
look or the way I dress.

480
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:12,148
I think I kind of
understand what she means.

481
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,998
The ground cherry
thief is a real brat.

482
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:24,827
Why would she play with
your heart like this?

483
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,498
Don't speak ill of Yu Ri!

484
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:28,767
Please.

485
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,338
Stop crying.

486
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:34,838
She's my first and last love.

487
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,307
I was even going
to propose to her.

488
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:41,217
Yesterday, I went to Jongno
and bought her a gold ring.

489
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,778
But I can't believe...

490
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:47,918
There must be a reason why she
suddenly broke up with you.

491
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:49,987
I don't know why.

492
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:53,128
It's Imoogi. Imoogi took her.

493
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:55,057
Mr. Lee.

494
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:56,398
Rang.

495
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:01,137
What are you doing?

496
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:03,267
You're awake. You're back.

497
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,807
Stop acting so unusual. You're
making me want to die again.

498
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,478
- How did you wake up?
- What do you mean by that?

499
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,778
What do you mean
Imoogi took her?

500
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:15,217
He saved my life, and she
went with him in return.

501
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,577
Soo Ho saw them leave together.

502
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,188
No, we need to find her.

503
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:23,188
- Not like this.
- What if he kills her?

504
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:24,557
Let me go.

505
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,998
Are you dumb or what? Are
you trying to die with her?

506
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,927
I figured you wouldn't be able to
punch him, so I did it instead.

507
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,267
I promise you this.

508
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,037
I'll save your girlfriend
and bring her back.

509
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,847
I'll kill Imoogi.

510
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,978
Leave that to me.

511
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:49,318
He tried to kill me twice.

512
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:53,418
What about Soo Ho?

513
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:55,358
Is he home all by himself?

514
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:56,958
Yes, of course.

515
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,128
You can't leave
a kid home alone!

516
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:03,458
He won't leave the house even
if you try to drag him out.

517
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:26,818
You're all here.

518
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:29,717
Although, I can't say
I'm glad to see everyone.

519
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,228
Who are they?

520
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:33,657
They're my part-timers.

521
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:46,307
- What are you looking at?
- You also look like a sculpture,

522
00:40:46,307 --> 00:40:47,608
so I can already tell.

523
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:48,907
You're not human, are you?

524
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,447
Don't talk to me
or I'll bite you.

525
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:53,608
No wonder.

526
00:40:53,748 --> 00:40:55,878
So there are 3
humans and 2 foxes.

527
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:57,347
What are you, Dr. Koo?

528
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:01,358
There are 3 humans and 3 foxes.

529
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:05,387
Now that we're done introducing
ourselves, let's begin.

530
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:08,197
We're here to discuss our
plan, so why are you here?

531
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,498
Because I've dealt with
Imoogi a lot more than you.

532
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:11,998
And you also have
one inside your body.

533
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:17,467
Leave her out. What if he hears
everything from inside her body?

534
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:20,168
No, we need her for this.

535
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:22,677
Whoever disagrees
with that can leave.

536
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,117
We've all encountered
Imoogi at least once.

537
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,987
And we almost got killed
by him one way or another.

538
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:33,347
He's even holding
someone hostage.

539
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:38,688
On top of that, he lives
in two bodies, not one.

540
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,427
We need to catch them both in
order for this fight to end.

541
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:43,728
And what's even worse...

542
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:48,338
What's even worse is...

543
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:52,708
that the main spirit
lives inside my body.

544
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,017
Hey, Imoogi's friend.

545
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:05,517
Why don't you just kill yourself
and make this easy for all of us?

546
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:08,458
You should've just
stayed in bed.

547
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:10,958
Living as Sleeping Beauty
suits you a lot better.

548
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:16,798
We can't kill Imoogi by
hurting him physically.

549
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,168
He can even manipulate
people's thoughts,

550
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:22,298
and Ji A and I are the only ones
who are free from his powers.

551
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:25,467
It won't be easy,
but try your best...

552
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,168
not to face him one on one.

553
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,338
But how can we fight him
without encountering him?

554
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:32,748
You won't be able to do much
even if you do encounter him.

555
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:35,077
You'd probably
just call for help.

556
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:36,918
- I'm warning you.
- "I'm warning you."

557
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:40,217
What does Terry eventually
want by doing all this?

558
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,958
He told me he's going
to kill everyone.

559
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,557
And then...

560
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:48,728
Soon after, a virus will spread.

561
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:52,668
No one will ever be happy again.

562
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:54,438
"A virus"?

563
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:02,338
Will you stop playing games?

564
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:06,008
I'm listening. Just
get to the point.

565
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:11,918
Up until now, I was worried
Ji A might get hurt.

566
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,258
So I kept trying to fight
the Imoogi we all know.

567
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,157
But now,

568
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,228
we're going to
change our target.

569
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:21,458
How are you going to kill
what's inside her body?

570
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:24,467
You've found a way, right?

571
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:27,197
Yes, I have.

572
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:35,577
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

573
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:41,920
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

574
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:46,318
Do you remember the fortune teller
we met at the Korean Folk Village?

575
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:48,117
Yes, of course.

576
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:50,657
Thanks to someone,
I lost my fox bead.

577
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,557
I heard he's actually pretty
powerful. Is that true?

578
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:55,358
He's one of the
afterlife judges.

579
00:43:57,157 --> 00:43:59,168
- What?
- He even has...

580
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:00,467
the Sin Slayer.

581
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:03,597
No way.

582
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,338
What's a Sin Slayer?

583
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:07,237
It's a dagger that slays sins.

584
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,208
It slays sins?

585
00:44:09,537 --> 00:44:12,677
I heard King Hades made it himself
a long time ago with the branch...

586
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,208
of the tree that
weighs our sins.

587
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,017
But didn't it disappear
thousands of years ago?

588
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:20,088
Snail Bride just picked it up.

589
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:24,557
But wouldn't that dagger
hurt Director Nam?

590
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,657
No, she won't get hurt.

591
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:27,898
The Sin Slayer is
a wooden dagger.

592
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:30,697
It slays things that
cannot be slain.

593
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:34,168
In other words, it'll
only slay Imoogi's spirit.

594
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:36,137
Thank goodness, Ji A.

595
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,237
When are we going to do this?

596
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,048
Tomorrow.

597
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,037
How does it feel
to be born again?

598
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:16,778
I don't know if it's because
I came back from the dead,

599
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:18,478
but this coffee tastes amazing.

600
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:20,708
You should live a long life.

601
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:23,947
If you die early, you won't be
able to drink coffee anymore.

602
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:25,048
It'd be no fun.

603
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:26,787
Were you scared I might die?

604
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:29,418
Yes, I was scared.

605
00:45:32,657 --> 00:45:34,128
What's yours? Let me have a sip.

606
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:36,958
It's good.

607
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:41,068
Why are you so nice to me?

608
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:44,137
We've never really been to
a cafe like this together.

609
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,938
All I needed to do
was just reach out.

610
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:50,307
I don't get why I never
thought of doing that.

611
00:45:51,278 --> 00:45:53,577
What's with you? You're acting
like you're about to die soon.

612
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:02,588
It's really delicious.

613
00:46:02,588 --> 00:46:05,387
It is, isn't it? Let me
try a sip of yours too.

614
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:08,458
- No, you can't have mine.
- You ungrateful punk.

615
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,298
Hey, don't drink mine.

616
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:23,537
What happened?

617
00:46:24,077 --> 00:46:25,248
Nothing.

618
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:26,548
Was it her?

619
00:46:27,278 --> 00:46:28,447
It wasn't like that.

620
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:29,818
You're defending her,
so I guess I'm right.

621
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:39,458
Will that sin-slaying dagger
really work on Imoogi?

622
00:46:39,688 --> 00:46:41,458
It has been over 600 years.

623
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:45,327
I plan to end this
fight once and for all.

624
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:47,398
What if you fail?

625
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:53,037
What happens to me then?

626
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:56,807
Rang.

627
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:00,907
That's why I need you.

628
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:10,657
I worked so hard all my life.

629
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:14,628
I was so close to becoming the
most powerful man in the nation.

630
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:15,697
Darn it.

631
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:18,228
But I'm stuck in this tiny cell.

632
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:23,037
At least I'm alive.

633
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,367
I'm alive.

634
00:47:59,537 --> 00:48:01,608
<font color="#00ff00">TWO MEALS</font>

635
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:02,677
This too.

636
00:48:03,307 --> 00:48:05,108
How could you want
tteokbokki right now?

637
00:48:05,248 --> 00:48:08,378
Even if the world ends
tomorrow, I'd want tteokbokki.

638
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:10,117
Give me that. Fill that up.

639
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:11,946
- You want a cheese ball, right?
- Yes.

640
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:14,617
- One cheeseball, please.
- Okay.

641
00:48:21,057 --> 00:48:22,498
This is so good.

642
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:25,728
- This is really good.
- This?

643
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,938
How does this taste good even
in the midst of everything?

644
00:48:30,097 --> 00:48:31,237
Right?

645
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:39,407
Don't come to me
for the time being.

646
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,947
Your lives may be in
danger if you're with me.

647
00:48:42,648 --> 00:48:43,717
That's up to me.

648
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:45,987
You guys almost died.

649
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:51,327
Do you remember...

650
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:54,258
when my mom came to Seoul
to get back surgery?

651
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:58,168
She cried because she couldn't go
to the hospital because of her show.

652
00:48:58,267 --> 00:49:00,028
You went to the
hospital in my place.

653
00:49:00,528 --> 00:49:02,068
You were there for my mom.

654
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:04,568
If she were all alone that day,

655
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:07,508
I would've blamed myself
forever after she died.

656
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,938
- Let us help too.
- She's right.

657
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,878
We're ordinary humans,
so we're powerless,

658
00:49:13,878 --> 00:49:17,577
but I want to do anything I
can if it will save your life.

659
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:25,487
Right now, going back to work...

660
00:49:25,487 --> 00:49:27,088
is how you can help me.

661
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:31,128
Mr. Choi will throw a hissy
fit if all three of us are out.

662
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:32,398
He isn't in.

663
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,697
What?

664
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:36,767
He turned himself in?

665
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:41,108
Imoogi wouldn't just
let him live like that.

666
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:46,947
Find out what's happening
at the police station.

667
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:48,217
Okay.

668
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,287
The person you have reached...

669
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:55,157
Mr. Choi isn't
answering his phone.

670
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:07,267
- Call an ambulance!
- Okay.

671
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,398
This is Geumran Police Station.

672
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:13,537
- We need...
- Let... Let me. I'll help.

673
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,838
- Please hold his head up.
- Okay.

674
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:37,197
Snail Bride, we have
to pull up our plan.

675
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:51,779
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

676
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,869
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

677
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:31,264
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

678
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:37,088
He's making his move.

679
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:38,927
We don't have much time.

680
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:43,927
We'll catch the Imoogi
in Ji A's body today.

681
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:50,097
Everything must go
exactly as planned.

682
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:51,967
We get it, so say it.

683
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:54,467
It's simple.

684
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,438
Ji A will draw her blood...

685
00:51:56,537 --> 00:51:57,907
and lure Imoogi out.

686
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,918
Once he comes out, I'll stab
him with the Sin Slayer.

687
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:05,588
Shin Ju. Once Ji A and I go in,

688
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:06,887
lock the door from the outside.

689
00:52:07,517 --> 00:52:10,818
No one can come near us
until I give the signal.

690
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:14,487
Why not?

691
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:16,728
By chance if he
escapes from Ji A,

692
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:19,927
you guys will be in danger.

693
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:22,767
He may enter one of your bodies.

694
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:25,407
That's why I made a
border with horse blood.

695
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:28,208
He's different from the
Imoogi we've known until now.

696
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:31,878
We don't know what he looks
like or how and where he'd move.

697
00:52:32,378 --> 00:52:34,077
We don't know
anything right now.

698
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:36,517
We cannot make a single mistake.

699
00:52:36,517 --> 00:52:39,418
What if he goes into you?

700
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:42,787
That won't happen as
long as I'm conscious.

701
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,128
Shin Ju.

702
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:51,568
It's a snake. I got one that
is a perfect fit for him.

703
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:57,697
So, the best is if you
can slay it in one go.

704
00:52:57,697 --> 00:52:59,307
Even if he gets away,

705
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:02,677
that snake is the only
body he can go into.

706
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:08,418
Let's go. I want to get rid
of it as soon as possible.

707
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:57,798
Here's the dagger.

708
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:04,697
Thank you. You should go.

709
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,338
Please be careful.

710
00:54:52,217 --> 00:54:53,347
Okay, then.

711
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:56,188
Shall we begin?

712
00:54:56,688 --> 00:54:57,818
But first,

713
00:54:59,157 --> 00:55:01,958
tie me to the chair with this.

714
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:05,568
What if I hurt you again?

715
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:07,097
That's unncessary.

716
00:55:07,427 --> 00:55:10,037
Do as I say. Okay?

717
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:18,108
Why do you keep
trying to protect me?

718
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:35,827
I have a bad feeling about this.

719
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:38,157
Don't say that. You'll jinx it.

720
00:55:58,287 --> 00:56:00,787
Okay, then. I'll tie you up.

721
00:56:02,117 --> 00:56:04,717
Okay. Yeon.

722
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:08,258
Will you give me a hug?

723
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:20,634
Don't hesitate
because of me, okay?

724
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:22,905
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

725
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:25,344
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

726
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:28,414
I'm prepared for any
unwanted injuries.

727
00:56:28,914 --> 00:56:30,375
As if I'd let you get hurt.

728
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:33,445
Besides, this dagger can
only slay the unslayable,

729
00:56:33,445 --> 00:56:35,414
like Imoogi's soul.

730
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:40,384
Does that mean, it
can also slay...

731
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:42,054
your soul too?

732
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:54,366
Don't hesitate
because of me, okay?

733
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:56,866
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

734
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:59,036
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

735
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:02,076
I'm prepared for any
unwanted injuries.

736
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,045
As if I'd let you get hurt.

737
00:57:04,476 --> 00:57:07,116
Besides, this dagger can
only slay the unslayable,

738
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:09,146
like Imoogi's soul.

739
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,956
Does that mean, it
can also slay...

740
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:15,786
your soul too?

741
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:19,726
Of course, it can.

742
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:32,005
- But...
- Yes?

743
00:57:34,005 --> 00:57:35,405
I've been meaning to ask.

744
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:38,976
Who are you?

745
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:42,885
What's dying...

746
00:57:43,686 --> 00:57:44,815
is your soul.

747
00:57:55,465 --> 00:57:56,666
- You can't.
- Move.

748
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:59,396
I'll kill her if
anything happens to Yeon.

749
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:02,235
Do so, but only
over my dead body.

750
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:04,405
You think that can stop me?

751
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:13,315
How pathetic.

752
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:18,085
Who knew you'd actually come in
possession of the Sin Slayer?

753
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:24,956
Hey. Are you pretending
to be asleep?

754
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:38,266
Wait.

755
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:41,206
Did that really kill his soul?

756
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:41,135
This was inevitable anyway.

757
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:52,315
So how about it? An
old home for a new one.

758
01:00:05,056 --> 01:00:06,795
Don't you know how pricey
houses are these days?

759
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:08,525
You little thief.

760
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:10,425
- What on earth?
- Isn't it obvious?

761
01:00:11,726 --> 01:00:13,135
This is what I
needed to confirm.

762
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,766
So this is how you
jump from body to body.

763
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,806
The fortune teller has been
untraceable since the folk village.

764
01:00:25,175 --> 01:00:28,416
Even the Gatekeeper of Samdo River
hasn't been able to spot him.

765
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:30,315
Darn it.

766
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,016
What now?

767
01:00:32,956 --> 01:00:36,525
Go out and find me a
random wooden dagger.

768
01:00:36,726 --> 01:00:37,786
A wooden dagger?

769
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,326
What use do you have
for a blunt dagger?

770
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,025
To slay the unslayable.

771
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:53,206
How about we change
the game a bit?

772
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,846
Stop the car.

773
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:11,385
So this dagger was never...

774
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:14,126
It cost 10 dollars
at a flea market.

775
01:01:14,956 --> 01:01:17,366
The fortune teller
only pops up...

776
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:19,465
wherever it wants to
whenever it wants to.

777
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:21,835
Darn rat.

778
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:23,565
Right back at you.

779
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:25,376
What was with the
silly Ji A act?

780
01:01:25,536 --> 01:01:26,675
Did you know it was me?

781
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:30,076
I could smell the
metallic scent of blood.

782
01:01:30,576 --> 01:01:32,275
As you know, I have a
heightened sense of smell.

783
01:01:33,076 --> 01:01:35,286
Anyway, I thank you
for the donation.

784
01:01:37,315 --> 01:01:39,186
Knowing my secret...

785
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:41,056
doesn't automatically
give you the upper hand.

786
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:45,295
Even if you bury it elsewhere,
I'll still find a way back to her.

787
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,826
I will keep doing so until
you hand over your body.

788
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:53,195
So what you're saying is that I
can plant your soul elsewhere...

789
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:54,795
by burying this.

790
01:01:57,266 --> 01:02:00,635
For instance... How
about that rat snake?

791
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:04,146
I dare you to try.

792
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:09,646
Don't tell me...

793
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:12,916
you're expecting me...

794
01:02:13,056 --> 01:02:15,786
to be gently dragged
out of this body.

795
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,346
Right. If I'm being honest,

796
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:40,076
I like this piece of Imoogi
better than the other one.

797
01:02:40,476 --> 01:02:43,116
A villain should at
least be this crazy.

798
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:45,416
Romance, my foot.

799
01:02:46,715 --> 01:02:50,385
This woman is and will
always be my hostage.

800
01:02:50,385 --> 01:02:52,726
The other piece of Imoogi is
more interested in Ji A...

801
01:02:52,726 --> 01:02:54,355
than being united with you.

802
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:57,295
He is nothing but a
bunch of fragments.

803
01:02:57,295 --> 01:02:59,065
Not according to him though.

804
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:02,436
You think you can pit
us against each other?

805
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:04,405
Dream on.

806
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:10,646
Do you even know what
he's up to right now?

807
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:16,485
You see, he's...

808
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:36,405
Irritating imbeciles.

809
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:05,446
<font color="#00ff00">NAME: NAM JI A, DATE

812
01:04:27,715 --> 01:04:29,626
Innocent lives are
being sacrificed.

813
01:04:30,326 --> 01:04:33,195
It won't be long before
chaos sweeps the world.

814
01:04:33,255 --> 01:04:35,255
No, you're wrong.

815
01:04:36,465 --> 01:04:40,135
All along, you're the one
who's been chaos itself.

816
01:04:40,565 --> 01:04:42,635
- Honey.
- Don't call me that.

817
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:44,635
For I...

818
01:04:45,775 --> 01:04:47,605
just decided to
give up that title.

819
01:04:47,876 --> 01:04:50,376
Don't be ridiculous.
On whose authority?

820
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:55,686
Stop right there.

821
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:57,616
You heard me!

822
01:04:57,815 --> 01:04:59,255
The moment you step
past those doors,

823
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:00,686
you'll lose everything.

824
01:05:00,686 --> 01:05:02,226
I'll make sure of it!

825
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:36,786
Are you okay?

826
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:53,335
Yeon.

827
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:56,746
Yes, it's me.

828
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:00,976
Let's hurry.

829
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,485
At least so I can be myself...

830
01:06:04,616 --> 01:06:06,516
right before it all ends.

831
01:06:10,585 --> 01:06:13,855
I want to be there beside you.

832
01:06:21,935 --> 01:06:23,065
Let's end this.

833
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:26,475
Let's put an end...

834
01:06:28,076 --> 01:06:29,145
to this exhausting fight.

can catch Imoogi!</i>

844
01:07:19,725 --> 01:07:21,025

845

<i>If it weren't for me,
Yeon would still be...</i>

846
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:28,094
<i>living as a mountain spirit.</i>

847
01:07:28,538 --> 01:07:30,248
<i>Yeon will never
forgive me for this.</i>

848
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:33,025
<i>Don't make me regret
liking you, Yu Ri.</i>

849
01:07:33,025 --> 01:07:36,125
<i>I have the power to destroy
everything you care for.</i>

850

<i>Let's join hands and kill the
gatekeeper of Samdo River.</i>

851
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:42,035
<i>And what's the condition?</i>

852
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,565
<i>Give me Ji A.</i>
