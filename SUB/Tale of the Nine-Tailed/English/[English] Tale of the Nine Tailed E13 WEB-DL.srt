7
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:01,387
Does it not hurt anymore?

8
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:05,188
Look at me.

9
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:17,297
Long time no see, Yeon.

10
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,297
Long time no see, Yeon.

11
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:22,838
She's mine.

12
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:24,068
She's mine.

13
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:34,617
How does it feel?

14
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:38,058
After a whole 600 years,

15
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,587
you face your enemy through
the body of the woman you love.

16
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,028
Ji A...

17
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,598
Where is she?

18
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,668
Right here. She lies inside me.

19
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,668
She screams in agony...

20
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:56,308
while resenting her
inevitable fate.

21
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:57,638
Let me ask you this, then.

22
00:01:58,338 --> 00:01:59,808
Who was the other guy...

23
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:03,948
and what exactly are you?

24
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,278
This is all your doing.

25
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,248
If you had let her be
sacrificed in the island's well,

26
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:13,618
we would've stayed as one,
not be split into two.

27
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,558
Though when the times
comes, we'll unite.

28
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:22,427
And when exactly
will that happen?

29
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,567
When we jump into
your body instead.

30
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,278
What's with your
obsession over my body?

31
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,948
Why can't you unite in another's
and live happily ever after?

32
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,448
Are you not aware of
the speed it grows?

33
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,218
Could it be...

34
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,088
that you not only grow,

35
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:47,758
but also age as fast?

36
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,858
That's the curse laid on you.

37
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:56,868
I came across one opportunity
to change my fate.

38
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,968
By becoming a dragon?

39
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,308
If I had,

40
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,738
I'd have been the spirit
of Baekdudaegan, not you.

41
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,578
So what you want is revenge.

42
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,178
That's why out of all
the immortal bodies,

43
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,148
you're after mine.

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,488
Just so you know, now
that I'm finally dominant,

45
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,488
she'll soon fade away.

46
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,558
- I'll kill you.
- If you do,

47
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:23,058
she'll die too.

48
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,528
And saving her will
lead to your death.

49
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:32,838
Will you save her
or save yourself?

50
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,007
I hate to tell you this,

51
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,907
but none of the above
is what we want.

52
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,488
Yap all you want.

53
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,157
I won't let you touch this body.

54
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,808
You're weak.

55
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,637
What?

56
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,407
Does it weaken you to
be dominant in her body?

57
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:18,248
Most of the Imoogi's strength
and abilities lie with him.

58
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,148
You're only the
heart, so to speak.

59
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,048
That's why you need
Ji A as your shield...

60
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,917
to prevent me from
knowing how weak you are.

61
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:33,528
You two can't change
the inevitable.

62
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,937
With you gone, it'll
be over. Just you.

63
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:47,377
And you're the only
one I need, Ji A.

64
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,377
Please.

65
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,477
Just give up that
body of yours and die.

66
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,198
Ji A,

67
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:10,997
I know you can hear me.

68
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,568
I know you're there.

69
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,268
Shut it.

70
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,607
Come back to me.

71
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,378
I'll always be waiting for you,

72
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:27,177
so come back to me.

73
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:30,987
I'll always be waiting for you.

74
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:34,758
I've been waiting for you too.

75
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:38,927
When it comes to waiting,
no one can do it better.

76
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,297
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

77
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,737
I had a feeling that
I could meet you here.

78
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,667
I'll always be by your side.

79
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,508
I'm yours till death do us part.

80
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:12,657
Yeon...

81
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,948
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

82
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:45,828
Help me, Yeon.

83
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,268
Just kill me instead.

84
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,037
So that I never hurt you.

85
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:07,747
Ji A, it's all right.

86
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,117
It'll all be all right.

87

<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 13: THE OTHER IMOOGI</font>

88
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:29,087
Dr. Koo, thank you for
today. You saved us.

89
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,758
Thank Mr. Lee Yeon, not me.

90
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:33,388
Take care then, guys.

91
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:36,797
Mr. Lee!

92
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,537
I'll be right there.

93
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,837
Yeon or the Imoogi, none
of them matter to me.

94
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,477
All I need are the
ground cherries.

95
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:52,878
Just the ground cherries!

96
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,777
Hey, there.

97
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:01,188
One shouldn't be so rough
in the driver's seat.

98
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,957
- Who are you?
- The name's Hyeonuiong.

99
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,258
I'm here to retrieve
the ground cherries.

100
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:10,227
Who sent you? Imoogi? Lee Yeon?

101
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,768
How's that of importance?

102
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,768
What matters is that this
doesn't belong to you.

103
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,868
Stop talking nonsense.

104
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,707
The ground cherries
are mine. They're mine!

105
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,008
Gosh, that hurt so much.

106
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,537
I hate the smell of gunpowder.

107
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:29,717
Listen to me. You shouldn't
fight against fate.

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,217
What? Are you also a monster?

109
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:34,488
My goodness.

110
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,787
It looks like we'll
meet again pretty soon.

111
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,337
Mr. Lee.

<font color="#00ff00">SHIN JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

113
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,838
So right now, she's
Director Nam, right?

114
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,518
But who knows when she might turn
into Imoogi and attack you again?

115
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,777
I let him hurt me.

116
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,547
What?

117
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:45,287
I wanted to check.

118
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:51,397
The fact that Imoogi split
into two could be his strength,

119
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:56,437
but it could also
be a fatal weakness.

120
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,098
What do you mean?

121
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,667
The Imoogi inside Ji A's body...

122
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,378
is a little different from
the one I've seen until now.

123
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,407
They're both the same Imoogi
but a little different?

124
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,277
This one is a lot more similar
to the Imoogi from my past life.

125
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,417
What can I do to help?

126
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,817
Go meet the Snail Bride and ask
her about the fortune teller.

127
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,958
The guy who took the fox bead?

128
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,667
Should I turn them
back into humans?

129
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:33,307
Check the list and turn only those
who still have lives left to live.

130
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:35,008
It'll be tiring to turn them
all into humans at once.

131
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,738
Okay, got it. But
let's eat first.

132
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,447
Honey, should I
buy you tteokbokki?

133
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:40,907
How about I add some
fritters and sundae as well?

134
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,348
I also want extra cheese.

135
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:47,047
Okay, I'll add extra
mozzarella cheese.

136
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,287
And as for spiciness, I'll
order level three for you,

137
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,488
and I'll get myself a level one.

and hurt you.

152

I know better than anyone
that it wasn't you.

153

Look at me.

How do you feel? Are you okay?

be worried about me...

00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,317
when you were the
one who got hurt?

00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,868
I don't think I can go home.

162
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,307
What if I change
like I did earlier...

163
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,307
and hurt my parents?

164
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,547
Then I might really go crazy.

165
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:05,557
Then should we go
somewhere instead?

166
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:17,537
Yes, let's go somewhere.

167
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,878
Let's go to a place where
it'll just be the two of us.

168
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,917
Don't worry too much
about your parents.

169
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:31,077
I told Shin Ju to
keep an eye on them.

170
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,118
Thank you.

171
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,157
Where are we going?

172
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,297
Wherever.

173
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:03,147
Do you remember
when we first met?

174
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:06,287
When you were a little kid?

175
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,218
No.

176
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,088
Of course, I remember.

177
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,527
All my life, my job was
to chase after people.

178
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,167
You were the first person
to chase after me instead.

179
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,368
I should've just
asked you out then.

180
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:30,307
Then we would've been able
to enjoy our time together...

181
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,177
for a lot longer.

182
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,927
Darn it!

183
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,838
Were you going somewhere?

184
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,047
Forgive me. I
must've been crazy.

185
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:13,088
I was blinded by the ground
cherries. I was out of my mind!

186
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:15,657
Look at me.

187
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:24,098
You were born as a servant
in a filthy thatched house.

188
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:26,167
And you've come a
long way since then.

189
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,738
It's... It's all thanks to you.

190
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:33,407
I saved you right before you were
about to get executed for treason.

191
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,338
Yes, how will I ever forget?

192
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:37,508
Then...

193
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,077
why did you help Lee Yeon?

194
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:51,287
I heard you told
him a lot of stuff.

195
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:55,527
Please... Please show me mercy
and give me another chance.

196
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:56,657
No, there's no need.

197
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,197
I no longer need...

198
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,567
anything or anyone.

199
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:05,968
There's been a change of plans.

200
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,368
Pardon?

201
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,147
I want you to become miserable.

202
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,848
And I mean, every single
person who's alive right now.

203
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:27,888
Go and turn yourself in.

204
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,167
You're better off
living as a criminal.

205
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,138
Should we play a game?

206
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,748
What game?

207
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:51,047
Like you said earlier, let's
pretend like we don't know anything.

208
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,118
How exactly?

209
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:58,687
You're just an average person
who's bored of your dull...

210
00:16:58,687 --> 00:16:59,858
and ordinary life.

211
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:01,327
And as for me,

212
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,927
let's say I'm not
a nine-tailed fox.

213
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,567
Do we know each other?

214
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,037
We're...

215
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:14,567
married. We're a married couple.

216
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,838
We're just an average couple.

217
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,447
Let's say you went
to work as usual,

218
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,277
and I'm waiting for you to
come home as I cook dinner.

219
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,077
- What do you think?
- So I'm the breadwinner?

220
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:26,018
I own tons of buildings
and have a lot of cash.

221
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:29,187
I just want to be a house husband
who gets paid rent every month.

222
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,588
Don't laugh. Try being serious.

223
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,228
What do you want me to do?

224
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,327
Just a second.

225
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,427
Wait here for a moment.

226
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,878
Okay, now come home from work.

227
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:51,478
Go on. Come home from work.

228
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,347
Gosh, this feels stupid.

229
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,827
I'm home.

230
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:08,857
Honey.

231
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,198
"Honey, I'm home"?

232
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,567
Is my little puppy mad?

233
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:17,198
Why are you mad?

234
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:20,238
Look at the time.

235
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,978
You always say it's normal for
a woman to come home late...

236
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,508
because you're
out there working.

237
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,678
Did you or did you not promise
to be home by midnight?

238
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:28,978
Did you promise me or not?

239
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,777
- Do I have a curfew?
- Yes.

240
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,518
You broke curfew
twice last month too.

241
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:35,218
Are promises to me unimportant?

242
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:38,317
I did, didn't I? Can you
forgive me just this once?

243
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,827
This just won't do. Take a seat.

244
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,097
Sit. Let's talk.

245
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:49,867
Honey. You finally got
sober not long ago.

246
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:52,837
Me?

247
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,678
You're creating the
background story too.

248
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,248
Darling, you've changed.

249
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,047
Do you even love me?

250
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:05,787
I love you.

251
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,557
Me too.

252
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,857
Are we making up now?

253
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:19,228
Of course. Our
fights never last...

254
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,998
more than five minutes.

255
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,277
It's not fair.

256
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:35,148
Why can't we even have an
ordinary life like this?

257
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,547
It's so unfair.

258
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:52,827
It would've been so nice...

259
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:55,498
if you were human...

260
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,137
and we were really married...

261
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,337
If Imoogi never existed...

262
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,148
If we lived in a
world like that...

263
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,418
If I had met you like that...

264
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,428
I'll protect you.

265
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,428
No matter what happens...

266
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,738
when this fight ends,
you must stay alive.

267
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,938
That's good enough for me.

268
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,688
Regardless of how many
times I am reborn,

269
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,317
the world is filled
with darkness.

270
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,698
Yeon, I'll show you...

271
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:06,627
what the world I live in
looks like at the end.

272
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:34,688
<font color="#00ff00">TERRY</font>

273
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:45,738
Hello?

274
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,168
A party will begin.

275
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:49,877
I don't plan to be
nice to you anymore.

276
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:52,577
Just wait.

277
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,218
I pity you.

278
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,617
You've never learned how
to give or receive love.

279
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,617
All you know how to do is
threaten people like this.

280
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,258
As you say, I am
threatening you.

281
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:09,998
Because your body will
be a ticking time bomb.

282
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,768
Look at yourself.

283
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,807
Soon, that will take full
control over your body.

284
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:32,948
When that time comes, you will
kill Yeon with your own hands.

285
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,218
Have you lost your mind?

286
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,057
Why are you going
through my computer?

287
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:19,228
What are you thinking? Why are
you messing with when she dies?

288
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:23,867
She's the real thing.

289
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,867
The real Imoogi.

290
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:27,837
What do you mean?

291
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:31,077
The real Imoogi is
within her body.

292
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,347
We must get rid of that in order to
get rid of the one running rampant.

293
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:38,518
You plan to sacrifice an
innocent child to catch Imoogi?

294
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,748
Knowing what she means to Yeon?

295
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:43,018
I do. I know better than anyone.

296
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:46,027
- So how could you?
- That's why I'm doing it.

297
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,827
Yeon can never let her die.

298
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:50,758
Imoogi knows that as well.

299
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,198
What do you think will happen...

300
00:24:53,198 --> 00:24:54,698
if it takes over Yeon's body?

301
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,268
You'll kill a person because of
something that didn't happen yet?

302
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,938
What are you trying to
protect by doing that?

303
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,208
This is my job!

304
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,178
Because of that same reason,

305
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:09,148
our son lost his wife,
and we lost our son.

306
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:13,188
You added her name to the
list of the dead then too.

307
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:14,718
Thanks to that,

308
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,887
our son took his own life,

309
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:21,228
and we couldn't
save his soul yet.

310
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:22,928
Thanks to that, we
prevented a pandemic.

311
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:24,857
Bok Gil can't even
be reincarnated!

312
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:33,567
That was...

313
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:36,307
his fate.

314
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:39,248
You know, I thought you
had changed a little...

315
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:42,307
after losing your
child like that.

316
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:46,418
But I was wrong. You
haven't changed at all.

317
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,958
A much greater
calamity will come.

318
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,688
- If we don't stop it now...
- Fine.

319
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:54,587
You stop the calamity.

320
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,627
I'll stop you.

321
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,627
What are you trying to do?

322
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:04,438
The moment you change
the date that she dies,

323
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,168
it's over between us.

324
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:49,347
I write this as I
watch you sleep.

325
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:53,617
I've decided to return to Seoul.

326
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:59,488
The conclusion I made after
spending a night here is this.

327
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,498
No matter how far we run,

328
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,067
we can't escape.

329
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,978
I'm on the beach.

330
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,847
Let's walk together.

331
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:24,978
Let's walk to the end of the
beach and go back together.

332
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,817
I'm small and powerless.

333
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,287
The weight of my destiny
is too much to bear.

334
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:39,527
I feel like I'll sink to
the bottom of that ocean.

335
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:45,837
But Yeon, you push
me up like a buoy.

336
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,607
You make me float.

337
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,577
You make sure I don't sink.

338
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:06,527
I vowed to give her...

339
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:10,658
the gift of a boring...

340
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,867
and warm life...

341
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,198
that normal people live,

342
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,367
but down by the beach,

343
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:23,307
this is how she replied.

344
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,347
"Not alone."

345
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:29,248
She wishes to die together...

346
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:31,918
and live together.

347
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:35,317
However,

348
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:38,787
that seems to be a promise...

349
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,658
I can't make.

350
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:50,897
Save Mr. Lee.

351
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,496
I tried everything,
but to no avail.

352
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,266
Why should I?

353
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:59,637
Why must I help you?

354
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,337
Because I stabbed
him on your command.

355
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:03,607
This is your responsibility too.

356
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,147
What do you think I even am?

357
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,946
The owner of the
ground cherry tree.

358
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,246
You don't scare me.

359
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:14,686
And you mean that.

360
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,986
Still, shouldn't a deal
be beneficial to me too?

361
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:20,387
You don't seem to have
anything to offer,

362
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:25,097
and this half-breed
is useless to me now.

363
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,067
Take my life in
exchange for his.

364
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:35,567
Are you sure?

365
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:38,377
Just a second.

366
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,077
Mr. Lee, I'll no
longer be with you now,

367
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:47,946
but I wish you a long life.

368
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,956
Don't skip your meals
and put on some weight.

369
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:54,887
Stop chasing after
your brother too.

370
00:29:58,427 --> 00:29:59,526
Just a little.

371
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,597
I hope you find a
little more happiness.

372
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:12,177
Kill me.

373
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:23,216
Don't stall. That's
even more annoying!

374
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,256
Open your eyes.

375
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:30,597
Consider your request granted.

376
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:32,627
However,

377
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,196
you're coming with me.

378
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:44,077
When the Imoogi in
her calls for you,

379
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,907
you will become my soldier.

380
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,117
Stay in places like
that for too long...

381
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:01,456
and the darkness will
swallow you whole.

382
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,208
How may I help you?

383
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:28,607
I'm here to turn myself in.

384
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:30,148
Sorry?

385
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:31,948
I'm here to turn myself in.

386
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:35,148
I killed her.

387
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:36,787
Killed whom?

388
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:39,587
The mummified victim you found.

389
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:42,418
Are you for real?

390
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,228
There are four more.

391
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,627
Search my car's GPS history,

392
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:50,097
and you'll find the burial
sites for all victims.

393
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,627
- Check it out.
- Sure.

394
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,267
What's your motive?

395
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,638
Why would the head of a
broadcasting station...

396
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:01,077
All I wanted was longevity.

397
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,648
If you had been in my shoes,

398
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:08,418
you would've made
the same choice.

399
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:17,888
Want me to go in with you?

400
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:19,728
No.

401
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:24,327
I want to properly draw a picture
of my parents' faces inside my head.

402
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,938
- If anything happens to me...
- That'll never happen.

403
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:36,577
Still, go ahead, if
that's how you feel.

404
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:40,218
Don't worry though.

405
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,988
It only surfaces when
it senses danger.

406
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,458
Or when it detects blood.

407
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:02,998
Come to think of it...

408
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,008
Long time no see, Yeon.

409
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:16,077
The scales are slowly
replacing my skin.

410
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:19,248
It might not be long before...

411
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:21,758
I lose myself completely.

412
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:44,607
Well, I'm off to
see the Snail Bride.

413
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:47,517
Bring my part-timers
over to my place later.

414
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:49,888
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan?

415
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:00,497
Yu Ri... Where's Yu Ri?

416
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,997
She left with that scary man.

417
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:06,667
She won't ever be back.

418
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,308
What did the fortune teller
say? Did you look into it?

419
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:20,317
I've been asking my contacts.

420
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:23,718
He didn't seem like
some lowly spirit.

421
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:25,647
Who is this geezer?

422
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:27,058
Well,

423
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,027
this seems to be a
groundless rumor,

424
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:34,027
but one of the
Afterlife judges...

425
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:37,968
is said to leave his
post once in a while.

426
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,508
That's interesting.

427
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:49,207
Anyway, let me know if you
find out anything about him.

428
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:53,417
- Here.
- What is this?

429
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,477
What is all this?

430
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:58,317
I was never able to buy you
anything with the money I earned.

431
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:00,857
It's been eating away at me.

432
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:03,957
When did you find the time...

433
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:06,227
out of your busy
schedule to buy this?

434
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:08,857
Gosh, it's pretty.

435
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,297
How nice.

436
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:12,428
Try it on.

437
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:15,897
I don't want to wear it out.

438
00:35:17,468 --> 00:35:18,937
Our daughter bought this...

439
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:20,437
with the money she
worked hard to earn.

440
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:22,078
Wearing it out is
how we thank her.

441
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,047
Go ahead and try it on.

442
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:25,948
Should I?

443
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,308
This isn't the way home.

444
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:52,868
Give me five minutes.

445
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,377
Is it that good? Is it?

446
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:00,477
Yu Ri!

447
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,718
What brings you by at this hour?

448
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:15,658
That was unexpected.

449
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:16,828
It's my goodbye.

450
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:19,968
We're breaking up.

451
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:25,768
- What do you mean?
- Shin Ju, you were just dumped.

452
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,607
So don't wait for
me any longer...

453
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,008
and don't come looking for me.

454
00:36:31,308 --> 00:36:33,078
Did I do something wrong?

455
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,218
No, I'm just tired of you.

456
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:37,518
- I get bored easily, you see.
- No.

457
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,187
That's not who you are.

458
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:42,758
Though it takes a while,

459
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,658
you offer up your heart
once the road to it opens.

460
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:47,027
Though you act cold, you
are the kindest of them all.

461
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,198
- As if you know me well.
- I do.

462
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,727
- How you treat Rang and the dog...
- Enough with Mr. Nice Guy.

463
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,638
I hate how you patronize me...

464
00:36:55,638 --> 00:36:57,268
about needing
friends and family.

465
00:36:57,908 --> 00:37:00,777
Your dowdy looks and
that constant smile?

466
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:02,308
I hate them all.

467
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:09,218
I won't patronize you.

468
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,488
I'll buy and wear whatever
you tell me to wear.

469
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:13,888
I won't smile if you
don't want me to.

470
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:15,288
Will you please stop?

471
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:18,488
I hate you, okay?
I don't like you!

472
00:37:20,897 --> 00:37:21,957
You're lying.

473
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,098
I don't want you
clinging onto me either.

474
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:36,177
I'll be off now.

475
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:40,817
I can't break up with you.

476
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:44,118
- Let me go.
- No, I'll never let go.

477
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:47,458
I won't let go until you
take back what you just said.

478
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,027
Shin Ju.

479
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,668
You're making me get sick
of you by acting like this.

480
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,498
I'm sorry.

481
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:06,708
I'm sorry for whatever it is
that made you feel this way...

482
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:20,217
Don't follow me.

483
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,328
Will you please just
disappear from my life?

484
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:53,918
She told me I act too nice.

485
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:58,388
She doesn't like how I
look or the way I dress.

486
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,558
I think I kind of
understand what she means.

487
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,408
The ground cherry
thief is a real brat.

488
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,237
Why would she play with
your heart like this?

489
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:15,908
Don't speak ill of Yu Ri!

490
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,177
Please.

491
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:21,748
Stop crying.

492
00:39:22,147 --> 00:39:24,248
She's my first and last love.

493
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,717
I was even going
to propose to her.

494
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:30,627
Yesterday, I went to Jongno
and bought her a gold ring.

495
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:33,188
But I can't believe...

496
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,328
There must be a reason why she
suddenly broke up with you.

497
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,397
I don't know why.

498
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,538
It's Imoogi. Imoogi took her.

499
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:44,467
Mr. Lee.

500
00:39:44,768 --> 00:39:45,808
Rang.

501
00:39:48,808 --> 00:39:50,547
What are you doing?

502
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:52,677
You're awake. You're back.

503
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:56,217
Stop acting so unusual. You're
making me want to die again.

504
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,888
- How did you wake up?
- What do you mean by that?

505
00:40:00,058 --> 00:40:01,188
What do you mean
Imoogi took her?

506
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,627
He saved my life, and she
went with him in return.

507
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:05,987
Soo Ho saw them leave together.

508
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,598
No, we need to find her.

509
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:12,598
- Not like this.
- What if he kills her?

510
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:13,967
Let me go.

511
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,408
Are you dumb or what? Are
you trying to die with her?

512
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,337
I figured you wouldn't be able to
punch him, so I did it instead.

513
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,677
I promise you this.

514
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,447
I'll save your girlfriend
and bring her back.

515
00:40:32,688 --> 00:40:34,257
I'll kill Imoogi.

516
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:36,388
Leave that to me.

517
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:38,728
He tried to kill me twice.

518
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:42,828
What about Soo Ho?

519
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:44,768
Is he home all by himself?

520
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:46,368
Yes, of course.

521
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:50,538
You can't leave
a kid home alone!

522
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:52,868
He won't leave the house even
if you try to drag him out.

523
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,228
You're all here.

524
00:41:17,197 --> 00:41:19,127
Although, I can't say
I'm glad to see everyone.

525
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:20,638
Who are they?

526
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:23,067
They're my part-timers.

527
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,717
- What are you looking at?
- You also look like a sculpture,

528
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:37,018
so I can already tell.

529
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,317
You're not human, are you?

530
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,857
Don't talk to me
or I'll bite you.

531
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,018
No wonder.

532
00:41:43,158 --> 00:41:45,288
So there are 3
humans and 2 foxes.

533
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:46,757
What are you, Dr. Koo?

534
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:50,768
There are 3 humans and 3 foxes.

535
00:41:51,797 --> 00:41:54,797
Now that we're done introducing
ourselves, let's begin.

536
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,607
We're here to discuss our
plan, so why are you here?

537
00:41:57,837 --> 00:41:59,908
Because I've dealt with
Imoogi a lot more than you.

538
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,408
And you also have
one inside your body.

539
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,877
Leave her out. What if he hears
everything from inside her body?

540
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,578
No, we need her for this.

541
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:12,087
Whoever disagrees
with that can leave.

542
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:17,527
We've all encountered
Imoogi at least once.

543
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:20,397
And we almost got killed
by him one way or another.

544
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,757
He's even holding
someone hostage.

545
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,098
On top of that, he lives
in two bodies, not one.

546
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,837
We need to catch them both in
order for this fight to end.

547
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,138
And what's even worse...

548
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:37,748
What's even worse is...

549
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,118
that the main spirit
lives inside my body.

550
00:42:48,888 --> 00:42:50,427
Hey, Imoogi's friend.

551
00:42:51,328 --> 00:42:54,927
Why don't you just kill yourself
and make this easy for all of us?

552
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,868
You should've just
stayed in bed.

553
00:42:58,197 --> 00:43:00,368
Living as Sleeping Beauty
suits you a lot better.

554
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:06,208
We can't kill Imoogi by
hurting him physically.

555
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,578
He can even manipulate
people's thoughts,

556
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,708
and Ji A and I are the only ones
who are free from his powers.

557
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,877
It won't be easy,
but try your best...

558
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:16,578
not to face him one on one.

559
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:19,748
But how can we fight him
without encountering him?

560
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:22,158
You won't be able to do much
even if you do encounter him.

561
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:24,487
You'd probably
just call for help.

562
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,328
- I'm warning you.
- "I'm warning you."

563
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:29,627
What does Terry eventually
want by doing all this?

564
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:33,368
He told me he's going
to kill everyone.

565
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:35,967
And then...

566
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,138
Soon after, a virus will spread.

567
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:42,078
No one will ever be happy again.

568
00:43:42,638 --> 00:43:43,848
"A virus"?

569
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:51,748
Will you stop playing games?

570
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:55,418
I'm listening. Just
get to the point.

571
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,328
Up until now, I was worried
Ji A might get hurt.

572
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,668
So I kept trying to fight
the Imoogi we all know.

573
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:05,567
But now,

574
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:08,638
we're going to
change our target.

575
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,868
How are you going to kill
what's inside her body?

576
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:13,877
You've found a way, right?

577
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:16,607
Yes, I have.

578
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,987
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

579
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:31,330
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

580
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:35,728
Do you remember the fortune teller
we met at the Korean Folk Village?

581
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:37,527
Yes, of course.

582
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:40,067
Thanks to someone,
I lost my fox bead.

583
00:44:40,438 --> 00:44:42,967
I heard he's actually pretty
powerful. Is that true?

584
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:44,768
He's one of the
afterlife judges.

585
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,578
- What?
- He even has...

586
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:49,877
the Sin Slayer.

587
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,007
No way.

588
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:54,748
What's a Sin Slayer?

589
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:56,647
It's a dagger that slays sins.

590
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,618
It slays sins?

591
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,087
I heard King Hades made it himself
a long time ago with the branch...

592
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:03,618
of the tree that
weighs our sins.

593
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,427
But didn't it disappear
thousands of years ago?

594
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,498
Snail Bride just picked it up.

595
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:13,967
But wouldn't that dagger
hurt Director Nam?

596
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:15,067
No, she won't get hurt.

597
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:17,308
The Sin Slayer is
a wooden dagger.

598
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,107
It slays things that
cannot be slain.

599
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:23,578
In other words, it'll
only slay Imoogi's spirit.

600
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:25,547
Thank goodness, Ji A.

601
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:31,647
When are we going to do this?

602
00:45:36,388 --> 00:45:37,458
Tomorrow.

603
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:02,447
How does it feel
to be born again?

604
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:06,188
I don't know if it's because
I came back from the dead,

605
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:07,888
but this coffee tastes amazing.

606
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:10,118
You should live a long life.

607
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:13,357
If you die early, you won't be
able to drink coffee anymore.

608
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,458
It'd be no fun.

609
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,197
Were you scared I might die?

610
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:18,828
Yes, I was scared.

611
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:23,538
What's yours? Let me have a sip.

612
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:26,368
It's good.

613
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:30,478
Why are you so nice to me?

614
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:33,547
We've never really been to
a cafe like this together.

615
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:37,348
All I needed to do
was just reach out.

616
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:39,717
I don't get why I never
thought of doing that.

617
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:42,987
What's with you? You're acting
like you're about to die soon.

618
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:51,998
It's really delicious.

619
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:54,797
It is, isn't it? Let me
try a sip of yours too.

620
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,868
- No, you can't have mine.
- You ungrateful punk.

621
00:46:58,507 --> 00:46:59,708
Hey, don't drink mine.

622
00:47:11,848 --> 00:47:12,947
What happened?

623
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:14,658
Nothing.

624
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:15,958
Was it her?

625
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:17,857
It wasn't like that.

626
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:19,228
You're defending her,
so I guess I'm right.

627
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:28,868
Will that sin-slaying dagger
really work on Imoogi?

628
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:30,868
It has been over 600 years.

629
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:34,737
I plan to end this
fight once and for all.

630
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:36,808
What if you fail?

631
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:42,447
What happens to me then?

632
00:47:45,147 --> 00:47:46,217
Rang.

633
00:47:47,788 --> 00:47:50,317
That's why I need you.

634
00:47:57,797 --> 00:48:00,067
I worked so hard all my life.

635
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:04,038
I was so close to becoming the
most powerful man in the nation.

636
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:05,107
Darn it.

637
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,638
But I'm stuck in this tiny cell.

638
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:12,447
At least I'm alive.

639
00:48:14,677 --> 00:48:15,777
I'm alive.

640
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:51,018
<font color="#00ff00">TWO MEALS</font>

641
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:52,087
This too.

642
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,568
How could you want
tteokbokki right now?

643
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,838
Even if the world ends
tomorrow, I'd want tteokbokki.

644
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,577
Give me that. Fill that up.

645
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,406
- You want a cheese ball, right?
- Yes.

646
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:04,077
- One cheeseball, please.
- Okay.

647
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:11,958
This is so good.

648
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,188
- This is really good.
- This?

649
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:18,398
How does this taste good even
in the midst of everything?

650
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,697
Right?

651
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,867
Don't come to me
for the time being.

652
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:31,407
Your lives may be in
danger if you're with me.

653
00:49:32,108 --> 00:49:33,177
That's up to me.

654
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,447
You guys almost died.

655
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:40,787
Do you remember...

656
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:43,718
when my mom came to Seoul
to get back surgery?

657
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:47,628
She cried because she couldn't go
to the hospital because of her show.

658
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,488
You went to the
hospital in my place.

659
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,528
You were there for my mom.

660
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:54,028
If she were all alone that day,

661
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:56,968
I would've blamed myself
forever after she died.

662
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:00,398
- Let us help too.
- She's right.

663
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:03,338
We're ordinary humans,
so we're powerless,

664
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:07,037
but I want to do anything I
can if it will save your life.

665
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:14,947
Right now, going back to work...

666
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:16,548
is how you can help me.

667
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:20,588
Mr. Choi will throw a hissy
fit if all three of us are out.

668
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:21,858
He isn't in.

669
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,157
What?

670
00:50:25,128 --> 00:50:26,227
He turned himself in?

671
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:30,568
Imoogi wouldn't just
let him live like that.

672
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:36,407
Find out what's happening
at the police station.

673
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:37,677
Okay.

674
00:50:39,577 --> 00:50:41,747
The person you have reached...

675
00:50:42,077 --> 00:50:44,617
Mr. Choi isn't
answering his phone.

676
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,727
- Call an ambulance!
- Okay.

677
00:50:58,057 --> 00:50:59,858
This is Geumran Police Station.

678
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,997
- We need...
- Let... Let me. I'll help.

679
00:51:03,668 --> 00:51:05,298
- Please hold his head up.
- Okay.

680
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:26,657
Snail Bride, we have
to pull up our plan.

681
00:51:36,314 --> 00:51:41,285
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

682
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:07,329
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

683
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:20,724
<font color="#00ff00">TRADITIONAL KOREAN
CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

684
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:26,548
He's making his move.

685
00:52:26,778 --> 00:52:28,387
We don't have much time.

686
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:33,387
We'll catch the Imoogi
in Ji A's body today.

687
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,557
Everything must go
exactly as planned.

688
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,427
We get it, so say it.

689
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:43,927
It's simple.

690
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:45,898
Ji A will draw her blood...

691
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,367
and lure Imoogi out.

692
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,378
Once he comes out, I'll stab
him with the Sin Slayer.

693
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:55,048
Shin Ju. Once Ji A and I go in,

694
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,347
lock the door from the outside.

695
00:52:56,977 --> 00:53:00,278
No one can come near us
until I give the signal.

696
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,947
Why not?

697
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,188
By chance if he
escapes from Ji A,

698
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:09,387
you guys will be in danger.

699
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,227
He may enter one of your bodies.

700
00:53:12,597 --> 00:53:14,867
That's why I made a
border with horse blood.

701
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,668
He's different from the
Imoogi we've known until now.

702
00:53:18,537 --> 00:53:21,338
We don't know what he looks
like or how and where he'd move.

703
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:23,537
We don't know
anything right now.

704
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,977
We cannot make a single mistake.

705
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:28,878
What if he goes into you?

706
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:32,247
That won't happen as
long as I'm conscious.

707
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:35,588
Shin Ju.

708
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:41,028
It's a snake. I got one that
is a perfect fit for him.

709
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:47,157
So, the best is if you
can slay it in one go.

710
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,767
Even if he gets away,

711
00:53:49,628 --> 00:53:52,137
that snake is the only
body he can go into.

712
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:57,878
Let's go. I want to get rid
of it as soon as possible.

713
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:47,258
Here's the dagger.

714
00:54:51,927 --> 00:54:54,157
Thank you. You should go.

715
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:57,798
Please be careful.

716
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:42,807
Okay, then.

717
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,648
Shall we begin?

718
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,278
But first,

719
00:55:48,617 --> 00:55:51,418
tie me to the chair with this.

720
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:55,028
What if I hurt you again?

721
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,557
That's unncessary.

722
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,497
Do as I say. Okay?

723
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:07,568
Why do you keep
trying to protect me?

724
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:25,287
I have a bad feeling about this.

725
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:27,617
Don't say that. You'll jinx it.

726
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:50,247
Okay, then. I'll tie you up.

727
00:56:51,577 --> 00:56:54,177
Okay. Yeon.

728
00:56:56,088 --> 00:56:57,718
Will you give me a hug?

729
00:57:07,155 --> 00:57:10,094
Don't hesitate
because of me, okay?

730
00:57:11,135 --> 00:57:12,365
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

731
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,804
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

732
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:17,874
I'm prepared for any
unwanted injuries.

733
00:57:18,374 --> 00:57:19,835
As if I'd let you get hurt.

734
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:22,905
Besides, this dagger can
only slay the unslayable,

735
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:24,874
like Imoogi's soul.

736
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,844
Does that mean, it
can also slay...

737
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:31,514
your soul too?

738
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:43,826
Don't hesitate
because of me, okay?

739
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,326
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

740
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,496
It's only a blunt wooden dagger.

741
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:51,536
I'm prepared for any
unwanted injuries.

742
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:53,505
As if I'd let you get hurt.

743
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,576
Besides, this dagger can
only slay the unslayable,

744
00:57:56,576 --> 00:57:58,606
like Imoogi's soul.

745
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:03,416
Does that mean, it
can also slay...

746
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,246
your soul too?

747
00:58:07,215 --> 00:58:09,186
Of course, it can.

748
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:21,465
- But...
- Yes?

749
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:24,865
I've been meaning to ask.

750
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:28,436
Who are you?

751
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,345
What's dying...

752
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:34,275
is your soul.

753
00:58:44,975 --> 00:58:46,176
- You can't.
- Move.

754
00:58:46,336 --> 00:58:48,906
I'll kill her if
anything happens to Yeon.

755
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:51,745
Do so, but only
over my dead body.

756
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:53,915
You think that can stop me?

757
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:02,825
How pathetic.

758
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,595
Who knew you'd actually come in
possession of the Sin Slayer?

759
00:59:12,136 --> 00:59:14,466
Hey. Are you pretending
to be asleep?

760
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:27,776
Wait.

761
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:30,716
Did that really kill his soul?

762
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:30,645
This was inevitable anyway.

763
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:41,825
So how about it? An
old home for a new one.

764
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:56,305
Don't you know how pricey
houses are these days?

765
01:00:56,305 --> 01:00:58,035
You little thief.

766
01:00:58,276 --> 01:00:59,935
- What on earth?
- Isn't it obvious?

767
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:02,645
This is what I
needed to confirm.

768
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:07,276
So this is how you
jump from body to body.

769
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:14,316
The fortune teller has been
untraceable since the folk village.

770
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:17,926
Even the Gatekeeper of Samdo River
hasn't been able to spot him.

771
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:19,825
Darn it.

772
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:21,526
What now?

773
01:01:22,466 --> 01:01:26,035
Go out and find me a
random wooden dagger.

774
01:01:26,236 --> 01:01:27,296
A wooden dagger?

775
01:01:27,636 --> 01:01:29,836
What use do you have
for a blunt dagger?

776
01:01:30,606 --> 01:01:32,535
To slay the unslayable.

777
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,716
How about we change
the game a bit?

778
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:50,356
Stop the car.

779
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:00,895
So this dagger was never...

780
01:02:01,336 --> 01:02:03,636
It cost 10 dollars
at a flea market.

781
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:06,876
The fortune teller
only pops up...

782
01:02:06,876 --> 01:02:08,975
wherever it wants to
whenever it wants to.

783
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,345
Darn rat.

784
01:02:11,345 --> 01:02:13,075
Right back at you.

785
01:02:13,216 --> 01:02:14,886
What was with the
silly Ji A act?

786
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:16,185
Did you know it was me?

787
01:02:16,185 --> 01:02:19,586
I could smell the
metallic scent of blood.

788
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:21,785
As you know, I have a
heightened sense of smell.

789
01:02:22,586 --> 01:02:24,796
Anyway, I thank you
for the donation.

790
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:28,696
Knowing my secret...

791
01:02:28,696 --> 01:02:30,566
doesn't automatically
give you the upper hand.

792
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:34,805
Even if you bury it elsewhere,
I'll still find a way back to her.

793
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:38,336
I will keep doing so until
you hand over your body.

794
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:42,705
So what you're saying is that I
can plant your soul elsewhere...

795
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:44,305
by burying this.

796
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:50,145
For instance... How
about that rat snake?

797
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:53,656
I dare you to try.

798
01:02:57,955 --> 01:02:59,156
Don't tell me...

799
01:03:00,455 --> 01:03:02,426
you're expecting me...

800
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:05,296
to be gently dragged
out of this body.

801
01:03:24,386 --> 01:03:26,856
Right. If I'm being honest,

802
01:03:26,856 --> 01:03:29,586
I like this piece of Imoogi
better than the other one.

803
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:32,626
A villain should at
least be this crazy.

804
01:03:32,796 --> 01:03:34,926
Romance, my foot.

805
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:39,895
This woman is and will
always be my hostage.

806
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:42,236
The other piece of Imoogi is
more interested in Ji A...

807
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,865
than being united with you.

808
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:46,805
He is nothing but a
bunch of fragments.

809
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,575
Not according to him though.

810
01:03:48,776 --> 01:03:51,946
You think you can pit
us against each other?

811
01:03:52,816 --> 01:03:53,915
Dream on.

812
01:03:56,685 --> 01:04:00,156
Do you even know what
he's up to right now?

813
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:05,995
You see, he's...

814
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,915
Irritating imbeciles.

815
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:54,956
<font color="#00ff00">NAME: NAM JI A, DATE

818
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:19,136
Innocent lives are
being sacrificed.

819
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:22,705
It won't be long before
chaos sweeps the world.

820
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:24,765
No, you're wrong.

821
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:29,645
All along, you're the one
who's been chaos itself.

822
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:32,145
- Honey.
- Don't call me that.

823
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,145
For I...

824
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,115
just decided to
give up that title.

825
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:39,886
Don't be ridiculous.
On whose authority?

826
01:05:44,055 --> 01:05:45,196
Stop right there.

827
01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:47,126
You heard me!

828
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:48,765
The moment you step
past those doors,

829
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:50,196
you'll lose everything.

830
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,736
I'll make sure of it!

831
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:26,296
Are you okay?

832
01:06:41,785 --> 01:06:42,845
Yeon.

833
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:46,256
Yes, it's me.

834
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:50,486
Let's hurry.

835
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:52,995
At least so I can be myself...

836
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:56,026
right before it all ends.

837
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:03,365
I want to be there beside you.

838
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:12,575
Let's end this.

839
01:07:14,216 --> 01:07:15,985
Let's put an end...

840
01:07:17,586 --> 01:07:18,655
to this exhausting fight.

<i>Give me Ji A.</i>
