7
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:02,212
Where were you? I looked
everywhere for you.

8
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,192
The woman you just kissed.

9
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,162
Was it me?

10
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,062
Or...

11
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,062
your late first love?

12
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:27,801
The latter, I see.

13
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,842
- I...
- I'm...

14
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,211
not the shadow of
the one you seek.

15
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:40,081
So make up your mind
right here and now.

16
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,322
Either you cling on to your past
that's way past its expiration date,

17
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,551
or...

18
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:47,921
Or what?

19
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:54,891
See me clearly for who I am.

20
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,472
I know I'm not a
bad face to look at.

<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 6: FOUR
PILLARS OF DESTINY</font>

22
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:28,931
Are you two dating?

23
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,532
What's his job? His age?

24
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,502
Where are you
right now? Tell me.

25
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,331
Tell me who that guy is!

26
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,271
She's not returning
any one of my texts.

27
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,512
Maybe he's a source of hers.

28
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,681
No way.

29
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,812
Just think of the gaze he held.

30
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,621
It'd easily melt your heart.

31
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:55,021
Ms. Kim, tell your heart...

32
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:56,592
to get a grip on itself.

33
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,462
I thought she was
a loser though.

34
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,662
- What?
- When it comes to men.

35
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,232
She's terrible at relationships.

36
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,371
The weather's hot, isn't it?

37
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,342
I like the summer.

38
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:19,482
So foxes withstand
the heat well.

39
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:23,022
It's the season when the
woods are the chattiest.

40
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:25,352
I don't have to ask...

41
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,792
to know that every
flower and tree...

42
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,522
get their fair share of
sunlight, rain, and wind.

43
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,631
They have a small
party all on their own.

44
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,931
That's not the case
in the city though.

45
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,131
The sunlight one
enjoys at home...

46
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,001
differs depending on
the floor they live on.

47
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:45,501
It's the same for
humans and plants.

48
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,272
Receiving more sunlight
leads us to being healthier.

49
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,482
You're quite
observant, aren't you?

50
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:59,421
Why have you been avoiding
eye-contact with me though?

51
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,022
- When?
- Even now, you're looking...

52
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,191
over my shoulder.

53
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,361
Look, I see carp in the water.

54
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:17,042
How adorable.

55
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,441
Right?

56
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,571
They're adorable.

57
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:21,941
Right.

58
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:32,352
What are you looking at?

59
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:33,691
You.

60
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,631
It's what you told me to do.

61
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,691
That's enough.
Stop looking at me.

62
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,962
It can only take so much gazing.

63
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,671
Darn it. I shouldn't
have said that earlier.

64
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,972
Wait for me.

65
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:55,142
But Ms. Kim,

66
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:58,482
doesn't that man
seem familiar to you?

67
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:02,111
- He does.
- Right? Where did we see him?

68
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:03,551
In my dreams.

69
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:06,821
He's a blend of those
who appear in them.

70
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,452
I was talking about
our show or...

71
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,561
No way.

72
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,722
There's no way I forgot
that pretty face.

73
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,191
But I'm sure I
saw him somewhere.

74
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,301
Are you still talking
about that guy?

75
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,431
Even if you chat away,

76
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,741
at least let it seem
like you're working.

77
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:24,642
You're embarrassing me.

78
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,912
Ms. Kim told me that
a true journalist...

79
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:29,042
always digs until
one hits a dead end.

80
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,542
- I can't believe you told on me.
- Unbelievable.

81
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,311
By the way...

82
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,681
What did she say about the
guy? Did she text you back?

83
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,991
Not yet. The curiosity
is killing us too.

84
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,861
If I'm being honest,
he looks like a gigolo.

85
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,592
That's what you want to believe.

86
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:49,931
You want to believe...

87
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,332
that life isn't that unfair.

88
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,071
- Hey!
- What the...

89
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:56,272
Get back to work!

90
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,102
Don't just pretend
to and actually work.

91
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,311
Who are you
searching for though?

92
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,282
- The governor.
- The governor?

93
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,352
He knows who took your parents.

94
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,191
Really?

95
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,191
And who's this governor?

96
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:21,261
He wears the skin of a
human, but isn't one inside.

97
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,061
He's one of the four
mountain spirits...

98
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,332
that once ruled over Korea.

99
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,801
A mountain spirit?

100
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:30,342
Please don't forget that
you're in the presence of one.

101
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,702
Oh, right. A former
mountain spirit.

102
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,212
You were ousted, right?

103
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,941
I gave up my title
of my own accord.

104
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,011
It may sound like
bragging coming from me,

105
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,311
but the other three
were minor spirits.

106
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,751
Me? I was the master
of Baekdudaegan.

107
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,881
Got it?

108
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:46,592
Okay.

109
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,462
Why is a mountain spirit at
the Korean Folk Village though?

110
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,361
All mystical creatures tend
to gather at this place.

111
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:56,732
It's a decent hiding spot.

112
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,361
Call it a retro
craze if you want.

113
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:01,631
It's nice to reminisce.

114
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,842
Are there non-humans
among us right now?

115
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,342
Could be.

116
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,681
Really?

117
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,082
Most lose their scent after
mingling with tourists.

118
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,182
Then how do we find
who you're looking for?

119
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,791
There's no need to.
We'll have a good time...

120
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,621
and he'll find us instead.

121
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,521
The fortune teller's
that way. Let's go.

122
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:45,881
Let's see.

123
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,822
My goodness.

124
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:56,692
- Hello.
- My goodness, hello.

125
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,521
Gosh, someone is finally here.

126
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,192
Let's see.

127
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,232
I can read your fate, physiognomy,
compatibility, and previous life.

128
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,501
Which one are you here for?

129
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,172
If you know all that,

130
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,501
why do you work here for
only 20 dollars per reading?

131
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,541
It's just for fun.

132
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,241
Here you go.

133
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:16,911
Can you tell us about
our previous lives?

134
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,611
Your previous lives?

135
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:21,852
Where's the one
for previous lives?

136
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:24,722
Okay, let's see.
Your previous lives.

137
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,922
Good choice. Young
people these days...

138
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,491
tend not to care too much
about their previous lives.

139
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,361
But it's actually very
important, you see.

140
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:33,791
Don't move.

141
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,131
- There we go.
- Are you using an app?

142
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:41,432
It's easy to tell.

143
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:44,741
Something seemed special about
you the moment you walked inside.

144
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,041
What was I?

145
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,972
In your previous life, you were
a member of the royal family.

146
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,442
You were a princess.

147
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:55,881
It tells you that?

148
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:57,682
Then what about me?

149
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,251
You were...

150
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,232
Let's see.

151
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,261
My goodness, you were
a laborer in the past.

152
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,161
You died while building
the Hangang Bridge.

153
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:15,072
If you were just going
to talk nonsense,

154
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,802
why couldn't you just tell
me something nice as well?

155
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,472
You should buy a talisman.

156
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,141
A talisman, my foot.

157
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,381
You guys shouldn't hang
around with each other.

158
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,212
If you do, one of you will die.

159
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,521
What?

160
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,761
You two never should've
met in the first place.

161
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,602
- Hello.
- Hello.

162
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,401
- My goodness, you're beautiful.
- I know I'm beautiful.

163
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,472
Welcome.

164
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,141
My goodness, you should come with
me and bathe with the fairies.

165
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,541
- Hello.
- Welcome.

166
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,472
- Hey, fairy.
- Hello.

167
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,842
- Hello.
- Hi.

168
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:57,741
Welcome.

169
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:01,052
- He's a mountain spirit.
- Hello.

170
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,281
- Where's the fortune teller?
- The fortune teller?

171
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,982
You need to walk that
way for quite some time.

172
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:09,052
For quite some
time? In this heat?

173
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,261
Aren't there any taxis here?

174
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,031
No, but we have that over there.

175
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,672
<font color="#00ff00">TAXI</font>

176
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,052
Gosh, we just wasted money.

177
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:41,391
Was he talking gibberish or not?
I'm so bothered by what he said.

178
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,491
My team manager...

179
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,462
checked his compatibility with
his girlfriend before marriage,

180
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:48,192
and the fortune teller asked him
what took him so long to meet her.

181
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,102
They were told that
they were meant to be.

182
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,962
And then?

183
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,531
They were told that they'd
live happily ever after,

184
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:54,932
but it lasted less than a year.

185
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:56,102
- Did they get a divorce?
- Yes.

186
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,312
I don't believe in that
kind of stuff anyway.

187
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,582
If that kind of stuff is real, the
divorce rate in this country...

188
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:10,651
Who shot this arrow?

189
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,021
Who do you think would
use such a classic way...

190
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,521
to ask me out on a date?

191
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,192
Meet me at the
government office.

192
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,521
"The governor"?

193
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,732
Let's go.

194
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,911
One, two.

195
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,552
Go, go.

196
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:47,751
Nice.

197
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:50,361
Nice. That's what
I'm talking about.

198
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,192
Who are you?

199
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:04,472
- Are you here to read your fortune?
- No, I'm here for something else.

200
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,001
Do you need a talisman?

201
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,342
Enough of your nonsense.

202
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,041
I already know who you are.

203
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,062
Are the nine-tailed foxes
having a gathering here today?

204
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,131
- What?
- Forget it if I'm wrong.

205
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:39,572
Yeon was here.

206
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,371
Get to the point. A customer
might come any moment.

207
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,781
You have the item that helps us
see our past lives, don't you?

208
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,692
Let's see.

209
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:00,732
The eyebrows of a tiger.

210
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,501
My goodness. This is...

211
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,531
obviously not it.

212
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,271
Where is it?

213
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,401
My goodness. A goblin's cap.

214
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,472
Come on out gold

215
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:18,682
Let's see. Where is...

216
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:23,052
Ta-da.

217
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:28,322
Every single item that disappeared
from this world is all in this bag.

218
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:30,161
Give me that.

219
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,991
Not for free.

220
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,131
Here. What do you think?

221
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,241
My goodness.

222
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,371
My goodness, you fool.

223
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,982
- What?
- You can't buy this with money.

224
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,251
Why do you think these things
disappeared in the first place?

225
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:58,952
Look. It's gone again.

226
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,031
This place hasn't
changed at all.

227
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,672
Come on out, Governor.

228
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,401
Long time no see, Yeon.

229
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,972
You don't look as good
as you did before.

230
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:48,271
Why are you here?

231
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,771
I'm here to find someone.

232
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:53,312
Yeou Gogae falls under
your jurisdiction, right?

233
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,712
You do that kind of
stuff for humans?

234
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,682
I'm even willing to do more.

235
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:04,021
My fox sister died.

236
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,482
And apparently, the
guy who killed her...

237
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,452
right before her wedding was
a former mountain spirit.

238
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,822
And the guy who
helped her hide...

239
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:14,332
even after she ate all those livers
was also a former mountain spirit.

240
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,562
Living as a human being is
already difficult enough.

241
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,462
But you took away the lives
of all those pitiful...

242
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,031
All I did was...

243
00:17:21,302 --> 00:17:23,541
hunt down those who brought
chaos to this world...

244
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,072
and did not deserve
to live among humans.

245
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,111
You and I are walking
different paths.

246
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:38,552
Then I have nothing to tell you.

247
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:39,881
I'm here to get what I want.

248
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,442
Right now, you should
focus on staying alive.

249
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:21,462
You can't put a
price on what I have.

250
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,932
What if I take it
from you by force?

251
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:29,872
Then you'll get
sucked into this bag.

252
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,511
If you're curious,
give it a shot.

253
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,952
Then what do you want?

254
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:45,851
Let's trade.

255
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:50,521
Give me something that means
the most to you in return.

256
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,192
Something...

257
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,501
that means the most to me?

258
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,851
Wait here for a moment.

259
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:19,682
Five minutes will do.

260
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:23,761
Don't get hurt.

261
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,132
It's too tiring keeping
this suitable for kids.

262
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,132
What do you say? Should
we make this rated-R?

263
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,162
I do not permit death.

264
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:08,132
I do not permit rude
punks like that.

265
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,232
Agreed.

266
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,612
Do not demean the fight.

267
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,341
Please go that way.

268
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,982
- Why...
- I'm not so weak...

269
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,281
that I need a hostage.

270
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,351
It's fine.

271
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:30,222
He lives for looking cool.
Make yourself comfortable.

272
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,991
It's called having pride.

273
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:01,452
<font color="#00ff00">TAX EVADERS</font>

274
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,341
Do you have feelings
for the fox?

275
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,841
Or were you bewitched?

276
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:30,751
I...

277
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,652
What does Yeon mean to me?

278
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,872
I am using Yeon.

279
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,801
I entered into a contract
with him to find my family.

280
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:55,612
I pushed him into danger in order
to get information from you.

281
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,241
I like your honesty.

282
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:00,882
But I don't need
any of that now.

283
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,982
I want to kill them and
you quickly and go home.

284
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,291
He gets hurt wherever he goes...

285
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:13,521
because of me.

286
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:17,001
Looks like you won't have
such an easy life either.

287
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,031
I don't care.

288
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:24,271
If the path stinks, I'll
plant flowers along the way.

289
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:27,972
You're amusing.

290
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,672
It's as I've heard.

291
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:32,182
What?

292
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:36,051
However, you will
regret coming to me.

293
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,251
Who was it?

294
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:16,291
What moron brought a cell phone
into the Underworld of Darkness?

295
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,892
I'll leave your spicy
rice cakes here.

296
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:21,692
You twerp!

297
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:24,761
How could a grim
reaper say that?

298
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,561
Shut it! Find the
owner and torture him!

299
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:32,241
They've all gone soft.

300
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,682
This isn't spicy at all.

301
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:44,182
Sweetie!

302
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,581
Sweetie!

303
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,561
Where did he go? We're so busy.

304
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:38,801
The mirror of the moon.

305
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,271
Are you trying to
kill a person...

306
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,271
with one of the four gems of
the four mountain spirits...

307
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,811
intended to protect
all creation?

308
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:47,751
So did your fox bead
protect all creation?

309
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,452
Or did it protect one person?

310
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:57,061
Why don't we drop all items and
skills and fight barehanded?

311
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,692
Fine.

312
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:15,142
Her heart seems to
break if you get hurt.

313
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,212
What is she to you?

314
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,412
Hey, that's the kind of thing you
ask after two bottles of soju.

315
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,682
Everyone knows that.

316
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:32,761
You're upset. You must
be sincere about her.

317
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:35,932
- Shut it.
- You are foolish, Yeon.

318
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,031
How could you love
a human again?

319
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:41,071
Stop speaking like
that. It's exhausting.

320
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:02,821
You have to see it through
like this, don't you?

321
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,122
This is how I have lived.

322
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:07,692
You're so inflexible.

323
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:11,032
Let me see. I told
you not to get hurt.

324
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,502
It's fine. It's just a scratch.

325
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,377
Hold on.

326
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,992
Hey, get up. Have
an iced Americano.

327
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,791
I do not drink iced Americanos.

328
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,532
What's with you two?

329
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,002
Let me formally introduce you.
He's a mountain spirit as I said,

330
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,301
and my best friend.

331
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,942
His true identity
is a moon bear.

332
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:42,079
<font color="#00ff00">GRANNY</font>

333
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,179
Will you pick up already?

334
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:50,649
- I can't live like this anymore.
- That again?

335
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,388
I get startled and wake up
in the middle of the night.

336
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:58,128
My heart pounds really hard
when I think about my wife,

337
00:26:58,189 --> 00:26:59,759
and I have to pee.

338
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,198
I don't want to hear about
an old man's incontinence.

339
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,898
It's natural for a couple
to fall into ennui...

340
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:07,438
after being together
for centuries.

341
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,199
- Ennui?
- Even Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo,

342
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:11,969
everyone's favorite couple,

343
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,709
are debating whether or
not to stay together.

344
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:15,978
No wonder.

345
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:20,649
That's why it hasn't been
raining on Chilseok lately.

346
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:24,749
Just be honest with her.

347
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:26,619
No. I'm scared.

348
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:29,359
What eternal luxury
did I want to enjoy...

349
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:32,988
that I married the
sister of King Hades?

350
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,968
Why must I eat this?

351
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,938
It's ginseng chicken soup. It's
good for you and delicious.

352
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,569
But why are you
buying this for me?

353
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:50,549
I think I've misjudged
you a little.

354
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,579
What if you didn't misjudge me?

355
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:59,749
Based on experience, no one evil
ever pitied helpless animals.

356
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:02,289
I don't like you.

357
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:06,359
Are you deaf? I don't like you.

358
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:09,628
Even if you don't, I'm sure
you'll like the soup. Try it.

359
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,398
Why are you smiling like an idiot
when I said I don't like you?

360
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,738
I was told it's fine
to be cruel to those..

361
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:21,638
who can't complain that it
hurts even if you bite them.

362
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,208
You're a lot like the
pets that I've met.

363
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,119
What?

364
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,849
Those who were abused
and abandoned...

365
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:32,448
bite even the hand
that feeds them.

366
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,559
It's because they don't
know how to be loved.

367
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,398
Shut your trap.

368
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:54,878
What is precious to me?

369
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:57,708
As if there could be anything.

370
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,329
<font color="#00ff00">LEE RANG</font>

371
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:25,968
The person you have
reached is not available.

372
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,678
- You're ignoring my call?
- Please leave a message...

373
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,319
He even eats macarons.

374
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,619
They deliver both worlds...

375
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,418
of crispy rice puffs
and moist yakgwas.

376
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,188
Of course. So how
has it been lately?

377
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,599
You have a big family
to provide for.

378
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,228
The minimum wage
has been raised...

379
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,668
and I took out a
loan to buy a house.

380
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:53,968
Except for the characters
from fairy tales,

381
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:57,509
complaining about panic
disorders, it's been all right.

382
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:00,738
It all sounds like hard work.

383
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:04,309
I'll soon need to attend
my birthday party.

384
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:15,458
Have you perhaps
seen these people?

385
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:20,488
They disappeared 21 years ago.

386
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,668
I'll take even the smallest
lead, so if you know anything...

387
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,069
Was it March 3 on
the lunar calendar?

388
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:33,369
That's right. It's the exact
date of the car accident.

389
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,539
In the beginning of January,

390
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,478
a man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

391
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:39,049
He told me about the accident
that would occur on that day...

392
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:41,049
at Yeou Gogae.

393
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:42,349
A navy blue suit?

394
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:45,188
Are you saying that he caused
the accident on purpose?

395
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:50,888
So?

396
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:53,029
I don't get involved in
events that could harm humans.

397
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:55,329
I didn't lend him
any of my men either.

398
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,698
Who was this man?

399
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,069
At first, I thought he was
just wearing human skin.

400
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,769
- But no.
- Then what?

401
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,938
He was a human.

402
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,438
- Are you sure?
- That's what I smelled.

403
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,109
Tell me everything you
remember about him.

404
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,148
His face is so vague
in my memory...

405
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:15,819
that I probably
wouldn't recognize him.

406
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,148
That's how
average-looking he was.

407
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:21,019
But his forehead.

408
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:24,428
- His forehead?
- Albeit faint,

409
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,289
signs of human
branding was present.

410
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:28,529
<font color="#00ff00">HUMAN BRANDING: A
TYPE OF PUNISHMENT</font>

411
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,759
Human branding?

412
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,069
The one done to criminals?

413
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,999
- And the letters?
- "Seo" as in west...

414
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,339
and "Gyeong" as in Seoul.

415
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,138
Seogyeong.

416
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:43,109
Human branding indicates...

417
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,749
that he was born before the
Joseon Dynasty was found.

418
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,878
I wonder where he is right now.

419
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:50,478
Probably...

420
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,218
someplace close.

421
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:56,359
What do you mean by that?

422
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:59,829
Because the parents weren't
the targets of the accident.

423
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,059
What?

424
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,059
The daughter was
the initial target.

425
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:17,579
What are you going to do
if you hate every option?

426
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:23,918
<font color="#00ff00">GRANNY</font>

427
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:25,488
Darn it!

428
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:31,759
Darling! Get back over here
and help me with the workload.

429
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,658
Yes, darling. I'm on
my way back right now.

430
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:35,958
I won't be long. See you soon.

431
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:40,069
- I want a divorce.
- What?

432
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,869
That's right.

433
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:46,039
I'm getting a divorce!

434
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:47,609
Hey, you!

435
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,238
You?

436
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:53,779
- Me?
- I couldn't care less...

437
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,418
about an old man
getting a divorce...

438
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:57,749
when he's old enough to
drop dead at any second,

439
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,049
so shut it.

440
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:01,918
What the...

441
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:03,589
Where are your manners?

442
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,458
She must want to experience
what death is like.

443
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,728
Just let her be.
She's from overseas.

444
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,668
What's the world coming to?

445
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:16,269
Where did he find
someone that obnoxious?

446
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,279
Don't even bother bowing!

447
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,208
But sir...

448
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:31,589
- Do you even know who he is?
- Why should I care?

449
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,448
He's the gatekeeper
of Samdo River...

450
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,988
and the brother-in-law
of King Hades.

451
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,658
Does being tight
with King Hades...

452
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,688
gives you the right to
be loud in restaurants?

453
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:42,029
Just eat your meal.

454
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,898
Darn, it's hot.

455
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:50,939
Here.

456
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,338
Let go of me.

457
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:17,059
The dog house and food for
the puppy you brought in...

458
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,169
I can't take it.

459
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:21,869
- Then what?
- You'll raise it instead.

460
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:26,939
Put it to sleep and I'll make
sure you receive the same fate.

461
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,209
Does your family hate dogs?

462
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:30,638
I don't have one.

463
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:32,108
But there's someone who
rescued me from the zoo though.

464
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,919
- So he's your savior.
- Of course.

465
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:37,048
He ripped the
zookeeper into pieces.

466
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:39,218
He killed someone?

467
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:41,959
Who is this savior of yours?

468
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:45,289
Someone you'll be
meeting pretty soon.

469
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,039
Don't keep the
girl by your side.

470
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:05,508
Why's that?

471
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:07,408
According to the man
who sought me out,

472
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:09,879
the girl...

473
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,888
has the scales of the King.

474
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,258
The spirit of the
King lies with her.

475
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,678
Long time no see, Yeon.

476
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,218
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

477
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,919
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended...

478
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,119
if you hadn't
stopped the boat...

479
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:50,059
from crossing the Samdo River.

480
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,428
Could that have been a sign...

481
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:56,358
or...

482
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:00,528
Who could that man have been?

483
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:06,329
If he's lurking around me,
he could be someone I know.

484
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:11,539
A scar on his forehead?

485
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,778
I don't know such a person.

486
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:19,579
I'll look into it, so...

487
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:20,948
I just don't understand.

488
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:22,818
Why did he come after me...

489
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:25,048
and why did my parents have
to suffer because of it?

490
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:26,218
What am I anyway?

491
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:33,059
Yeon, why do you
keep protecting me...

492
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:34,459
without...

493
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,399
so much of an explanation?

494
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:46,908
Because...

495
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,548
I don't want you to get hurt.

496
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,678
I don't want you to
do anything for me.

497
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:01,318
I wish for your life...

498
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,019
to have a happy ending.

499
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,729
Also,

500
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,758
I'd like you to trust me.

501
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:20,309
Why don't we get
hold of that man?

502
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:23,838
How?

503
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:27,778
We have someone
that can serve...

504
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:29,318
as a link.

505
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,419
Why do you keep calling me?

506
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,388
Did you not see the 22
missed calls I left?

507
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:39,658
Do you think I'm
your girlfriend?

508
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:42,298
If I don't pick up, just
think that I'm busy.

509
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:43,399
We need to meet.

510
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,428
What are you scheming this time?

511
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,269
I just miss you. That's all.

512
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,869
You're obviously onto
something. I'm busy. Bye.

513
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,408
What are you so busy with?

514
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:57,238
Where are you right now?

515
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:03,079
Do you really think your brother
will tell you what he knows?

516
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:05,019
- No, of course not.
- Then what?

517
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:08,559
I'm going to make
Rang meet that guy.

518
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:10,888
How?

519
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:17,459
Hey, scribe.

520
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:20,068
Let me borrow this.

521
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,309
"Find"?

522
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:37,448
Find the man who has a criminal
branding on his forehead.

523
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,829
What did you just do?

524
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,758
It's like a talisman.

525
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:50,599
These shoes will take
Rang to that man.

526
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:56,169
We only have one shot.

527
00:39:57,138 --> 00:40:00,039
Today, we must keep our eyes
on Rang no matter what happens.

528
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:03,238
Okay, I won't lose
him no matter what.

529
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:20,428
Go on inside.

530
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:38,278
You're here.

531
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:42,879
Why aren't you saying hello?

532
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,218
Did you forget the funeral?

533
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:48,289
Yeon came back a
mess because of you.

534
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,829
That's what you
call brotherly love.

535
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,099
By the way, that hanbok
looks nice on you.

536
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,099
That suit looks horrible on you.

537
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:03,138
You're really sensitive today.
It's starting to get me excited.

538
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:06,039
You're always so high
every time we meet.

539
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:07,269
It's like you're on drugs.

540
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:10,979
What are you doing at
Korean Folk Village?

541
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,278
I'm obviously not here to
do homework for school.

542
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,749
If you were, you
would've flunked.

543
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:15,948
Hey, old man.

544
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,119
I came to check something.

545
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,119
You're back.

546
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,258
What are you trying to do?

547
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:28,129
Did you come here knowing that
he's an actual fortune teller?

548
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,399
Anyone can tell that he's a fraud.
Just look at this fake mustache.

549
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,669
It's real?

550
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,709
He kept talking nonsense.

551
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,309
He does that on
purpose, you fool.

552
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:43,738
Go ahead and check.

553
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:45,649
There's no way he
means the most to me.

554
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:15,309
Yes, he's the most precious
thing in your life.

555
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:17,638
Your brother.

556
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:22,318
Darn it.

557
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:31,959
I'm off now.

558
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:33,858
What are you doing?

559
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:38,298
How should I put it? I'm
pretty much selling you away.

560
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:40,298
You're unbelievable.

561
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:41,769
He'll explain what's going on.

562
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,468
You'll be left with nothing
else but time anyway.

563
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:45,738
I'll see you next time.

564
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:08,428
- Where are my shoes?
- I don't know.

565
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,428
Is he a kid or what?

566
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,669
He always turns so immature in
the most unexpected moments.

567
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:36,388
Where do you think you're going?

568
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:41,758
- You can go first.
- Okay.

569
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:47,468
- Let me go.
- You're mine.

570
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,338
- Says who?
- A deal is a deal.

571
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:50,499
It's an unfair deal.

572
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:58,309
Yeon, hurry.

573
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,879
If you want to trick me,
you should at least...

574
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:20,968
Go on. Business is
closed for today.

575
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:22,798
Where is Yeon?

576
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:25,138
He joined my collection.

577
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:33,079
Will you be here
tomorrow as well?

578
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:36,448
I only do business
whenever I feel like it.

579
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:38,189
And the location
changes every time.

580
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,619
We only have one shot.

581
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,519
We must keep our eyes on
Rang no matter what happens.

582
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,539
In the beginning of January,

583
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:57,269
a man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

584
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:00,008
These shoes will take
Rang to that man.

585
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,838
Do you have feelings
for the fox?

586
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,079
I wish for your life
to have a happy ending.

587
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,979
I'd like you to trust me.

588
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,189
- Let him go.
- No.

589
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:17,789
We have our rules.

590
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:20,028
- Please, sir.
- What's that?

591
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:24,999
- No, wait.
- Nothing can free him.

592
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:28,298
Tell me what I need to
do to get Yeon back.

593
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:30,369
The rules remain the same.

594
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:33,068
You can trade him with
your most precious item.

595
00:45:33,408 --> 00:45:34,468
I'll do it.

596
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,608
I'll buy Yeon.

597
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:26,658
What will you give me in return?

598
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,758
If you don't come back
before 9pm, our deal...

599
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:33,129
will become invalid.

600
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:37,169
I have 1 hour and 40 minutes
before the clock strikes 9.

601
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:41,908
What is it?

602
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,138
What's the one thing that
means the most to me?

603
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,068
Think.

604
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,338
Let's think.

605
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:21,249
Once the sun goes down

606
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:23,419
People get off work

607
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:27,289
But why am I still here working?

608
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,499
Hello? Open up!

609
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:44,838
Hello?

610
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:50,838
Hello? Hello?

611
00:47:57,678 --> 00:48:00,119
Please open up! Hello?

612
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,658
Is anyone inside? Hello?

613
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,559
Sir!

614
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:26,508
Governor?

615
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,079
I heard a familiar voice.

616
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:29,749
It looks like it's urgent.

617
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:36,218
Thanks.

618
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:37,988
Thanks!

619
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:52,068
Wait a minute.

620
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:58,809
So? What is precious to you?

621
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,019
This.

622
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:07,189
A broken music box.

623
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:09,258
It still works though.

624
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,838
It's the last birthday present
that my parents gave me.

625
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:31,879
Is that all?

626
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:39,519
It has been exactly 21 years...

627
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:42,158
since they went missing.

628
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:47,028
To be honest, my memories
grow more faint every year.

629
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:49,829
I get confused...

630
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:52,629
whether what I experienced
really happened or was a dream.

631
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:57,439
There's blood on this.

632
00:49:57,738 --> 00:49:59,209
That's why I hung on.

633
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:03,209
"What I saw that day
was not a dream."

634
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,178
"So..."

635
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:07,979
"they may be alive."

636
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:11,579
As in, it's like the last item
connecting you to your parents.

637
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:16,388
I'll appraise it.

638
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:53,588
What brings you
here at this hour?

639
00:50:57,459 --> 00:50:58,999
You're right.

640
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:01,999
Why did I come here?

641
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:05,198
What do you mean?

642
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,008
Never mind. Apologies.

643
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:22,088
Don't tell me that jerk...

644
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:28,928
<font color="#00ff00">FIND</font>

645
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:43,338
I will...

646
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:48,579
- not make the deal.
- What?

647
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:50,019
This isn't enough.

648
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:52,388
Why not? Why isn't it enough?

649
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:56,218
Because I'm not the one
that valuates items.

650
00:51:57,919 --> 00:51:59,229
Please tell me.

651
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:02,099
What must I do? What...

652
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:04,829
can I do?

653
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:08,428
You are an annoying customer!

654
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,468
I'll repay you somehow.

655
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,869
- Please?
- Fine! Fine!

656
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:17,738
You were a princess in
your past life, not now.

657
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:20,178
You think whining will get
you everything you want.

658
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:30,988
Your hand.

659
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:32,888
Give me your hand.

660
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,599
- Left hand!
- Left hand.

661
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:47,968
You were born with
a very special fate.

662
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:51,579
Water and fire may fight,

663
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:55,579
and the earth may be dark,
but metal shall rule over it.

664
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,879
Thus, even if you are
surrounded by darkness,

665
00:52:57,879 --> 00:52:59,649
a moon will shine from your sky.

666
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,718
What does that mean?

667
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:04,419
You possess the fox bead.

668
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:09,829
That is your moon.

669
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:11,428
Sorry?

670
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:12,928
Give me the bead.

671
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:17,402
Give me the bead.

672
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:21,373
Your life is overwhelmingly
blessed even without the moon.

673
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,442
- So...
- I'll give it to you.

674
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:26,243
I don't believe in fate.

675
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:30,252
I see.

676
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:32,553
The deal has been made.

677
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:35,382
Sorry? Already?

678
00:53:35,723 --> 00:53:36,792
The lines on your hand.

679
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:40,022
The lines have changed.

680
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:12,163
The fox bead is gone.

681
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:20,562
How could you beat up an old
man as soon as you got out?

682
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:23,672
He deserved it. How dare that
young punk treat me like that?

683
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:24,902
I'm much older.

684
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:28,873
How did you do it?

685
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:32,442
How else? I bought you.

686
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:34,183
With what?

687
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:41,022
You didn't like, give him 10
years of your life, did you?

688
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:44,692
No. You were much
cheaper than I expected.

689
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:49,993
So you're mine from now on.

690
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,873
I'm very superficial,

691
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:59,172
so I won't grant you freedom
so easily like Aladdin.

692
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:05,643
You're a bigger
villain than Jafar.

693
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,422
Why didn't you go with Rang?

694
00:55:20,893 --> 00:55:23,332
It was a precious opportunity
to find your parents.

695
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:29,573
To be honest, I was torn.

696
00:55:30,672 --> 00:55:33,002
"This may be my last chance."

697
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,612
"Am I confident I
won't regret it?"

698
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,743
- So why did you choose me?
- Because I was confident.

699
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,442
Because I felt like
I could trust you.

700
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:45,582
Because I felt like you'd
give my life a happy ending.

701
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,172
What are you thinking about?

702
00:56:04,672 --> 00:56:06,042
I realized...

703
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:10,913
there are more moments when a child
needs her parents than I thought.

704
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:15,013
For example, when the
child takes her first step.

705
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:17,882
Who else would be that
moved that you got up...

706
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:20,752
and took just a few
steps by yourself?

707
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:23,553
What about for you?

708
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:27,292
For me...

709
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:32,533
When I was the only one at a
picnic without a homemade lunch.

710
00:56:33,332 --> 00:56:35,033
When the kid I fought
with in class said,

711
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,373
"I'm going to tell
my mom on you."

712
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:40,772
I couldn't beat kids with moms.

713
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:45,073
What a shame. I
would've beaten them up.

714
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:49,752
I resented them a lot too.

715
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:52,212
"Why did they leave
me all alone?"

716
00:56:53,353 --> 00:56:54,882
"Why won't they come back?"

717
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:58,692
But they said it
was because of me.

718
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,362
The accident was because of me,

719
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:04,763
and my parents' lives
were ruined because of me.

720
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:12,343
You can cry if you want to.

721
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:15,672
No. I want to eat chicken feet.

722
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,683
Are you okay?

723
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:25,183
I'm not okay.

724
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,982
That's why I want to
eat spicy food and cry.

725
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:31,822
I want to be confused as
to whether it's my life...

726
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:34,462
or the spicy chicken feet
that's making me cry.

727
00:57:36,962 --> 00:57:38,032
That's cool of you.

728
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,063
What?

729
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:45,103
I was worried that you'd
lie about being all right.

730
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,143
I'm glad.

731
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:52,143
I was worried about looking
cute instead of cool.

732
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:58,353
- Dig in.
- Is it good?

733
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,422
- It's not as spicy as it looks.
- I see.

734
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:08,293
Is this too spicy for you?

735
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,063
Of course not.

736
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:14,402
Something got stuck in my eye.

737
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:18,203
I see you don't have a
tolerance for spicy food.

738
00:58:21,172 --> 00:58:22,243
As if.

739
00:58:23,243 --> 00:58:24,973
I'm not some loser, you know.

740
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:33,083
No, just wait.

741
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,453
This is my battle to fight.

742
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:05,822
Where are you going
at this late hour?

743
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:09,052
Nowhere important.

744
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:12,362
I just have an errand to run.

745
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,402
Goodnight, then.

746
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:26,043
Yeon, wait.

747
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:32,442
Don't be so nice to me.

748
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:36,152
To be honest, it scares me.

749
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:40,482
Having a protector makes
me want to be dependent,

750
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:43,753
and I'm worried...

751
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:47,192
that it'll only make me weaker.

752
00:59:49,762 --> 00:59:51,362
So that's how you've
lived your life.

753
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:08,243
Then I promise you this.

754
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:12,453
You'll reunite
with your family...

755
01:00:12,623 --> 01:00:14,422
and live out the
rest of your life.

756
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:17,623
When the time comes,

757
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:21,063
you'll forget about...

758
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:23,532
your time with me and the
knowledge you have on my world.

759
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:29,773
You will live...

760
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:32,873
a normal human life.

761
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,683
You startled me.

762
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,882
Make your presence
known, you fool.

763
01:00:51,723 --> 01:00:55,322
Granny, you know
everything, don't you?

764
01:00:58,493 --> 01:00:59,603
Regarding what?

765
01:01:00,902 --> 01:01:02,103
Imoogi.

766
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:07,373
It still lives.

767
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:25,012
Cause and effect is the
cardinal rule of our world.

768
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:30,393
Enough with the nonsense.

769
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:35,822
The girl was the one who
woke it up from its sleep.

770
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:40,132
And you were the one who sought
her out against my advice.

771
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:41,503
Then it's alive.

772
01:02:43,203 --> 01:02:44,433
Yes, it is.

773
01:02:47,072 --> 01:02:48,143
Then...

774
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,813
what was it that I fought for?

775
01:02:56,512 --> 01:02:58,953
Why did A Eum have
to give her life?

776
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,322
It was the path you two chose.

777
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,293
Where is it right now?

778
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:08,692
I've warned you
time and time again.

779
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,663
Foxes and humans can
never end up together.

780
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:17,902
- Tell me.
- Your obsession...

781
01:03:17,973 --> 01:03:19,902
- will be calamity.
- Tell me!

782
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:40,822
Hi.

783
01:03:57,712 --> 01:03:59,313
What exited the well...

784
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:02,043
went into hiding immediately.

785
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:08,183
A piece of it was
found recently though.

786
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:12,223
What?

787
01:04:57,172 --> 01:05:00,092
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

788
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:02,003
<i>I made a promise.</i>

789
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:03,373
<i>I'll protect her even
if it ends my life.</i>

790
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,212
<i>That's the thing with love.</i>

791
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,243
<i>One wrong move and it
can swallow you whole.</i>

792
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:11,482
<i>Yeon is someone I
care about now too.</i>

793
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:16,953
<i>Imoogi and Rang are
connected somehow.</i>

794
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:20,523
<i>Harm her in any way and I will
end you for good this time.</i>

795
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:22,393
<i>Don't get swept up in this.</i>

796
01:05:22,393 --> 01:05:23,762
<i>You don't want to see
the tragedy on replay.</i>

797
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:26,232
<i>But she'll be hurt
if I don't go.</i>

798
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:29,163
<i>You or the girl. One
must die in the end.</i>
