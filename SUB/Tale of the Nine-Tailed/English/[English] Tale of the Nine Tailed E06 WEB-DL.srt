1
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:20,162
Where were you? I looked
everywhere for you.

2
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,142
The woman you just kissed.

3
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,112
Was it me?

4
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,012
Or...

5
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:39,012
your late first love?

6
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:45,751
The latter, I see.

7
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,792
- I...
- I'm...

8
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,161
not the shadow of
the one you seek.

9
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:58,031
So make up your mind
right here and now.

10
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,272
Either you cling on to your past
that's way past its expiration date,

11
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,501
or...

12
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:05,871
Or what?

13
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:12,841
See me clearly for who I am.

14
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,422
I know I'm not a
bad face to look at.

15
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:40,971
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 6: FOUR
PILLARS OF DESTINY</font>

16
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:46,881
Are you two dating?

17
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,482
What's his job? His age?

18
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,452
Where are you
right now? Tell me.

19
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,281
Tell me who that guy is!

20
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,221
She's not returning
any one of my texts.

21
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,462
Maybe he's a source of hers.

22
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,631
No way.

23
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,762
Just think of the gaze he held.

24
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,571
It'd easily melt your heart.

25
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,971
Ms. Kim, tell your heart...

26
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:14,542
to get a grip on itself.

27
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,412
I thought she was
a loser though.

28
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,612
- What?
- When it comes to men.

29
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,182
She's terrible at relationships.

30
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,321
The weather's hot, isn't it?

31
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:34,292
I like the summer.

32
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:37,432
So foxes withstand
the heat well.

33
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:40,972
It's the season when the
woods are the chattiest.

34
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,302
I don't have to ask...

35
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,742
to know that every
flower and tree...

36
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,472
get their fair share of
sunlight, rain, and wind.

37
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,581
They have a small
party all on their own.

38
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,881
That's not the case
in the city though.

39
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,081
The sunlight one
enjoys at home...

40
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,951
differs depending on
the floor they live on.

41
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,451
It's the same for
humans and plants.

42
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:06,222
Receiving more sunlight
leads us to being healthier.

43
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,432
You're quite
observant, aren't you?

44
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,371
Why have you been avoiding
eye-contact with me though?

45
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,972
- When?
- Even now, you're looking...

46
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,141
over my shoulder.

47
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,311
Look, I see carp in the water.

48
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:34,992
How adorable.

49
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,391
Right?

50
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,521
They're adorable.

51
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:39,891
Right.

52
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:50,302
What are you looking at?

53
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,641
You.

54
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,581
It's what you told me to do.

55
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:59,641
That's enough.
Stop looking at me.

56
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:01,912
It can only take so much gazing.

57
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,621
Darn it. I shouldn't
have said that earlier.

58
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,922
Wait for me.

59
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,092
But Ms. Kim,

60
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,432
doesn't that man
seem familiar to you?

61
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,061
- He does.
- Right? Where did we see him?

62
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:21,501
In my dreams.

63
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:24,771
He's a blend of those
who appear in them.

64
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,402
I was talking about
our show or...

65
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:27,511
No way.

66
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,672
There's no way I forgot
that pretty face.

67
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,141
But I'm sure I
saw him somewhere.

68
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:36,251
Are you still talking
about that guy?

69
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:38,381
Even if you chat away,

70
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,691
at least let it seem
like you're working.

71
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,592
You're embarrassing me.

72
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,862
Ms. Kim told me that
a true journalist...

73
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,992
always digs until
one hits a dead end.

74
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,492
- I can't believe you told on me.
- Unbelievable.

75
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,261
By the way...

76
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:55,631
What did she say about the
guy? Did she text you back?

77
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,941
Not yet. The curiosity
is killing us too.

78
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:02,811
If I'm being honest,
he looks like a gigolo.

79
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,542
That's what you want to believe.

80
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,881
You want to believe...

81
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:10,282
that life isn't that unfair.

82
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,021
- Hey!
- What the...

83
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,222
Get back to work!

84
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,052
Don't just pretend
to and actually work.

85
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,261
Who are you
searching for though?

86
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,232
- The governor.
- The governor?

87
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:31,302
He knows who took your parents.

88
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,141
Really?

89
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:35,141
And who's this governor?

90
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:39,211
He wears the skin of a
human, but isn't one inside.

91
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,011
He's one of the four
mountain spirits...

92
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,282
that once ruled over Korea.

93
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:45,751
A mountain spirit?

94
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:48,292
Please don't forget that
you're in the presence of one.

95
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,652
Oh, right. A former
mountain spirit.

96
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,162
You were ousted, right?

97
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,891
I gave up my title
of my own accord.

98
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,961
It may sound like
bragging coming from me,

99
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,261
but the other three
were minor spirits.

100
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,701
Me? I was the master
of Baekdudaegan.

101
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,831
Got it?

102
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:04,542
Okay.

103
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:08,412
Why is a mountain spirit at
the Korean Folk Village though?

104
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:12,311
All mystical creatures tend
to gather at this place.

105
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,682
It's a decent hiding spot.

106
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,311
Call it a retro
craze if you want.

107
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:19,581
It's nice to reminisce.

108
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:22,792
Are there non-humans
among us right now?

109
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,292
Could be.

110
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,631
Really?

111
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,032
Most lose their scent after
mingling with tourists.

112
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,132
Then how do we find
who you're looking for?

113
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,741
There's no need to.
We'll have a good time...

114
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,571
and he'll find us instead.

115
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:43,471
The fortune teller's
that way. Let's go.

116
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:03,831
Let's see.

117
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,772
My goodness.

118
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:14,642
- Hello.
- My goodness, hello.

119
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:16,471
Gosh, someone is finally here.

120
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,142
Let's see.

121
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,182
I can read your fate, physiognomy,
compatibility, and previous life.

122
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,451
Which one are you here for?

123
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,122
If you know all that,

124
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:27,451
why do you work here for
only 20 dollars per reading?

125
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,491
It's just for fun.

126
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,191
Here you go.

127
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,861
Can you tell us about
our previous lives?

128
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,561
Your previous lives?

129
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:39,802
Where's the one
for previous lives?

130
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:42,672
Okay, let's see.
Your previous lives.

131
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,872
Good choice. Young
people these days...

132
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,441
tend not to care too much
about their previous lives.

133
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,311
But it's actually very
important, you see.

134
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,741
Don't move.

135
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:55,081
- There we go.
- Are you using an app?

136
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,382
It's easy to tell.

137
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:02,691
Something seemed special about
you the moment you walked inside.

138
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:03,991
What was I?

139
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,922
In your previous life, you were
a member of the royal family.

140
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,392
You were a princess.

141
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,831
It tells you that?

142
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:15,632
Then what about me?

143
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,201
You were...

144
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,182
Let's see.

145
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:28,211
My goodness, you were
a laborer in the past.

146
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,111
You died while building
the Hangang Bridge.

147
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:33,022
If you were just going
to talk nonsense,

148
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,752
why couldn't you just tell
me something nice as well?

149
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,422
You should buy a talisman.

150
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,091
A talisman, my foot.

151
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:41,331
You guys shouldn't hang
around with each other.

152
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,162
If you do, one of you will die.

153
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:50,471
What?

154
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,711
You two never should've
met in the first place.

155
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,552
- Hello.
- Hello.

156
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:04,351
- My goodness, you're beautiful.
- I know I'm beautiful.

157
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,422
Welcome.

158
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:08,091
My goodness, you should come with
me and bathe with the fairies.

159
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,491
- Hello.
- Welcome.

160
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,422
- Hey, fairy.
- Hello.

161
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,792
- Hello.
- Hi.

162
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,691
Welcome.

163
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,002
- He's a mountain spirit.
- Hello.

164
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,231
- Where's the fortune teller?
- The fortune teller?

165
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,932
You need to walk that
way for quite some time.

166
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,002
For quite some
time? In this heat?

167
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,211
Aren't there any taxis here?

168
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,981
No, but we have that over there.

169
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,622
<font color="#00ff00">TAXI</font>

170
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,002
Gosh, we just wasted money.

171
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,341
Was he talking gibberish or not?
I'm so bothered by what he said.

172
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,441
My team manager...

173
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,412
checked his compatibility with
his girlfriend before marriage,

174
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,142
and the fortune teller asked him
what took him so long to meet her.

175
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,052
They were told that
they were meant to be.

176
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,912
And then?

177
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,481
They were told that they'd
live happily ever after,

178
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,882
but it lasted less than a year.

179
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,052
- Did they get a divorce?
- Yes.

180
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:18,262
I don't believe in that
kind of stuff anyway.

181
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:21,532
If that kind of stuff is real, the
divorce rate in this country...

182
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,601
Who shot this arrow?

183
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,971
Who do you think would
use such a classic way...

184
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,471
to ask me out on a date?

185
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,142
Meet me at the
government office.

186
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:35,471
"The governor"?

187
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:37,682
Let's go.

188
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,861
One, two.

189
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,502
Go, go.

190
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:05,701
Nice.

191
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,311
Nice. That's what
I'm talking about.

192
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,142
Who are you?

193
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:22,422
- Are you here to read your fortune?
- No, I'm here for something else.

194
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:23,951
Do you need a talisman?

195
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:26,292
Enough of your nonsense.

196
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,991
I already know who you are.

197
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,012
Are the nine-tailed foxes
having a gathering here today?

198
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,081
- What?
- Forget it if I'm wrong.

199
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,522
Yeon was here.

200
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,321
Get to the point. A customer
might come any moment.

201
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,731
You have the item that helps us
see our past lives, don't you?

202
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:15,642
Let's see.

203
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,682
The eyebrows of a tiger.

204
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,451
My goodness. This is...

205
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,481
obviously not it.

206
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,221
Where is it?

207
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,351
My goodness. A goblin's cap.

208
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,422
Come on out gold

209
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:36,632
Let's see. Where is...

210
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,002
Ta-da.

211
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:46,272
Every single item that disappeared
from this world is all in this bag.

212
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,111
Give me that.

213
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:49,941
Not for free.

214
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,081
Here. What do you think?

215
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,191
My goodness.

216
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:07,321
My goodness, you fool.

217
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:10,932
- What?
- You can't buy this with money.

218
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:14,201
Why do you think these things
disappeared in the first place?

219
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,902
Look. It's gone again.

220
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:27,981
This place hasn't
changed at all.

221
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:38,622
Come on out, Governor.

222
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,351
Long time no see, Yeon.

223
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:04,922
You don't look as good
as you did before.

224
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,221
Why are you here?

225
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,721
I'm here to find someone.

226
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,262
Yeou Gogae falls under
your jurisdiction, right?

227
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,662
You do that kind of
stuff for humans?

228
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:19,632
I'm even willing to do more.

229
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,971
My fox sister died.

230
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,432
And apparently, the
guy who killed her...

231
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,402
right before her wedding was
a former mountain spirit.

232
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,772
And the guy who
helped her hide...

233
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:32,282
even after she ate all those livers
was also a former mountain spirit.

234
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,512
Living as a human being is
already difficult enough.

235
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:37,412
But you took away the lives
of all those pitiful...

236
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,981
All I did was...

237
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,491
hunt down those who brought
chaos to this world...

238
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,022
and did not deserve
to live among humans.

239
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,061
You and I are walking
different paths.

240
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:56,502
Then I have nothing to tell you.

241
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:57,831
I'm here to get what I want.

242
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:19,392
Right now, you should
focus on staying alive.

243
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:39,412
You can't put a
price on what I have.

244
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:40,882
What if I take it
from you by force?

245
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:47,822
Then you'll get
sucked into this bag.

246
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,461
If you're curious,
give it a shot.

247
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:00,902
Then what do you want?

248
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,801
Let's trade.

249
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:08,471
Give me something that means
the most to you in return.

250
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,142
Something...

251
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,451
that means the most to me?

252
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,801
Wait here for a moment.

253
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:37,632
Five minutes will do.

254
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:41,711
Don't get hurt.

255
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:19,082
It's too tiring keeping
this suitable for kids.

256
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:21,082
What do you say? Should
we make this rated-R?

257
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,112
I do not permit death.

258
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:26,082
I do not permit rude
punks like that.

259
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,182
Agreed.

260
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:31,562
Do not demean the fight.

261
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:37,291
Please go that way.

262
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,932
- Why...
- I'm not so weak...

263
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,231
that I need a hostage.

264
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,301
It's fine.

265
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,172
He lives for looking cool.
Make yourself comfortable.

266
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,941
It's called having pride.

267
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,402
<font color="#00ff00">TAX EVADERS</font>

268
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,291
Do you have feelings
for the fox?

269
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:42,791
Or were you bewitched?

270
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:48,701
I...

271
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:54,602
What does Yeon mean to me?

272
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:04,822
I am using Yeon.

273
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,751
I entered into a contract
with him to find my family.

274
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:13,562
I pushed him into danger in order
to get information from you.

275
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,191
I like your honesty.

276
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,832
But I don't need
any of that now.

277
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,932
I want to kill them and
you quickly and go home.

278
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,241
He gets hurt wherever he goes...

279
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,471
because of me.

280
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:34,951
Looks like you won't have
such an easy life either.

281
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:38,981
I don't care.

282
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:42,221
If the path stinks, I'll
plant flowers along the way.

283
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:45,922
You're amusing.

284
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,622
It's as I've heard.

285
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,132
What?

286
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:54,001
However, you will
regret coming to me.

287
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,201
Who was it?

288
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:34,241
What moron brought a cell phone
into the Underworld of Darkness?

289
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:37,842
I'll leave your spicy
rice cakes here.

290
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,642
You twerp!

291
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:42,711
How could a grim
reaper say that?

292
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:44,511
Shut it! Find the
owner and torture him!

293
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,191
They've all gone soft.

294
00:22:57,531 --> 00:22:59,632
This isn't spicy at all.

295
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:02,132
Sweetie!

296
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:04,531
Sweetie!

297
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,511
Where did he go? We're so busy.

298
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:56,751
The mirror of the moon.

299
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,221
Are you trying to
kill a person...

300
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:00,221
with one of the four gems of
the four mountain spirits...

301
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:01,761
intended to protect
all creation?

302
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,701
So did your fox bead
protect all creation?

303
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,402
Or did it protect one person?

304
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,011
Why don't we drop all items and
skills and fight barehanded?

305
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:16,642
Fine.

306
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,092
Her heart seems to
break if you get hurt.

307
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,162
What is she to you?

308
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:39,362
Hey, that's the kind of thing you
ask after two bottles of soju.

309
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:40,632
Everyone knows that.

310
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:50,711
You're upset. You must
be sincere about her.

311
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:53,882
- Shut it.
- You are foolish, Yeon.

312
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:55,981
How could you love
a human again?

313
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:59,021
Stop speaking like
that. It's exhausting.

314
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,771
You have to see it through
like this, don't you?

315
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,072
This is how I have lived.

316
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:25,642
You're so inflexible.

317
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,982
Let me see. I told
you not to get hurt.

318
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:31,452
It's fine. It's just a scratch.

319
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:33,422
Hold on.

320
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:36,992
Hey, get up. Have
an iced Americano.

321
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:42,791
I do not drink iced Americanos.

322
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,532
What's with you two?

323
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:49,002
Let me formally introduce you.
He's a mountain spirit as I said,

324
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,301
and my best friend.

325
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,942
His true identity
is a moon bear.

326
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:00,079
<font color="#00ff00">GRANNY</font>

327
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,279
Will you pick up already?

328
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,749
- I can't live like this anymore.
- That again?

329
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:13,488
I get startled and wake up
in the middle of the night.

330
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,228
My heart pounds really hard
when I think about my wife,

331
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,859
and I have to pee.

332
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,298
I don't want to hear about
an old man's incontinence.

333
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:23,998
It's natural for a couple
to fall into ennui...

334
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:25,538
after being together
for centuries.

335
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:28,299
- Ennui?
- Even Gyeonwu and Jiknyeo,

336
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:30,069
everyone's favorite couple,

337
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:31,809
are debating whether or
not to stay together.

338
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,078
No wonder.

339
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:38,749
That's why it hasn't been
raining on Chilseok lately.

340
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:42,849
Just be honest with her.

341
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,719
No. I'm scared.

342
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:47,459
What eternal luxury
did I want to enjoy...

343
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:51,088
that I married the
sister of King Hades?

344
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:59,068
Why must I eat this?

345
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,038
It's ginseng chicken soup. It's
good for you and delicious.

346
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,669
But why are you
buying this for me?

347
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,649
I think I've misjudged
you a little.

348
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,679
What if you didn't misjudge me?

349
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,849
Based on experience, no one evil
ever pitied helpless animals.

350
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,389
I don't like you.

351
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,459
Are you deaf? I don't like you.

352
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:27,728
Even if you don't, I'm sure
you'll like the soup. Try it.

353
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,498
Why are you smiling like an idiot
when I said I don't like you?

354
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,838
I was told it's fine
to be cruel to those..

355
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:39,738
who can't complain that it
hurts even if you bite them.

356
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,308
You're a lot like the
pets that I've met.

357
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,219
What?

358
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,949
Those who were abused
and abandoned...

359
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:50,548
bite even the hand
that feeds them.

360
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,659
It's because they don't
know how to be loved.

361
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:00,498
Shut your trap.

362
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:12,978
What is precious to me?

363
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:15,808
As if there could be anything.

364
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:38,429
<font color="#00ff00">LEE RANG</font>

365
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:44,068
The person you have
reached is not available.

366
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,778
- You're ignoring my call?
- Please leave a message...

367
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,419
He even eats macarons.

368
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,719
They deliver both worlds...

369
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,518
of crispy rice puffs
and moist yakgwas.

370
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:03,288
Of course. So how
has it been lately?

371
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,699
You have a big family
to provide for.

372
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:07,328
The minimum wage
has been raised...

373
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:09,768
and I took out a
loan to buy a house.

374
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,068
Except for the characters
from fairy tales,

375
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:15,609
complaining about panic
disorders, it's been all right.

376
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:18,838
It all sounds like hard work.

377
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:22,409
I'll soon need to attend
my birthday party.

378
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:33,558
Have you perhaps
seen these people?

379
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:38,588
They disappeared 21 years ago.

380
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:44,768
I'll take even the smallest
lead, so if you know anything...

381
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:47,169
Was it March 3 on
the lunar calendar?

382
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:51,469
That's right. It's the exact
date of the car accident.

383
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:52,639
In the beginning of January,

384
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,578
a man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

385
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:57,149
He told me about the accident
that would occur on that day...

386
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,149
at Yeou Gogae.

387
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:00,449
A navy blue suit?

388
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:03,288
Are you saying that he caused
the accident on purpose?

389
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:08,988
So?

390
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:11,129
I don't get involved in
events that could harm humans.

391
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,429
I didn't lend him
any of my men either.

392
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,798
Who was this man?

393
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:18,169
At first, I thought he was
just wearing human skin.

394
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:20,869
- But no.
- Then what?

395
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,038
He was a human.

396
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,538
- Are you sure?
- That's what I smelled.

397
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,209
Tell me everything you
remember about him.

398
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,248
His face is so vague
in my memory...

399
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,919
that I probably
wouldn't recognize him.

400
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,248
That's how
average-looking he was.

401
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,119
But his forehead.

402
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:42,528
- His forehead?
- Albeit faint,

403
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,389
signs of human
branding was present.

404
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,629
<font color="#00ff00">HUMAN BRANDING: A
TYPE OF PUNISHMENT</font>

405
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,859
Human branding?

406
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:51,169
The one done to criminals?

407
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:55,099
- And the letters?
- "Seo" as in west...

408
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:56,439
and "Gyeong" as in Seoul.

409
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,238
Seogyeong.

410
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:01,209
Human branding indicates...

411
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,849
that he was born before the
Joseon Dynasty was found.

412
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:06,978
I wonder where he is right now.

413
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,578
Probably...

414
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:11,318
someplace close.

415
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:14,459
What do you mean by that?

416
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,929
Because the parents weren't
the targets of the accident.

417
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,159
What?

418
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,159
The daughter was
the initial target.

419
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:35,679
What are you going to do
if you hate every option?

420
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:42,018
<font color="#00ff00">GRANNY</font>

421
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:43,588
Darn it!

422
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,859
Darling! Get back over here
and help me with the workload.

423
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,758
Yes, darling. I'm on
my way back right now.

424
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,058
I won't be long. See you soon.

425
00:31:56,268 --> 00:31:58,169
- I want a divorce.
- What?

426
00:31:58,869 --> 00:31:59,969
That's right.

427
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,139
I'm getting a divorce!

428
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:05,709
Hey, you!

429
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,338
You?

430
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:11,879
- Me?
- I couldn't care less...

431
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,518
about an old man
getting a divorce...

432
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:15,849
when he's old enough to
drop dead at any second,

433
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,149
so shut it.

434
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:20,018
What the...

435
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:21,689
Where are your manners?

436
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,558
She must want to experience
what death is like.

437
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,828
Just let her be.
She's from overseas.

438
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,768
What's the world coming to?

439
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,369
Where did he find
someone that obnoxious?

440
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,379
Don't even bother bowing!

441
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:45,308
But sir...

442
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,689
- Do you even know who he is?
- Why should I care?

443
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,548
He's the gatekeeper
of Samdo River...

444
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,088
and the brother-in-law
of King Hades.

445
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,758
Does being tight
with King Hades...

446
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,788
gives you the right to
be loud in restaurants?

447
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:00,129
Just eat your meal.

448
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:06,998
Darn, it's hot.

449
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:09,039
Here.

450
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:11,438
Let go of me.

451
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:35,159
The dog house and food for
the puppy you brought in...

452
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,269
I can't take it.

453
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:39,969
- Then what?
- You'll raise it instead.

454
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:45,039
Put it to sleep and I'll make
sure you receive the same fate.

455
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:47,309
Does your family hate dogs?

456
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:48,738
I don't have one.

457
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:50,208
But there's someone who
rescued me from the zoo though.

458
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:53,019
- So he's your savior.
- Of course.

459
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,148
He ripped the
zookeeper into pieces.

460
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,318
He killed someone?

461
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,059
Who is this savior of yours?

462
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,389
Someone you'll be
meeting pretty soon.

463
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,139
Don't keep the
girl by your side.

464
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:23,608
Why's that?

465
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,508
According to the man
who sought me out,

466
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:27,979
the girl...

467
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,988
has the scales of the King.

468
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,358
The spirit of the
King lies with her.

469
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:55,778
Long time no see, Yeon.

470
00:34:57,949 --> 00:35:00,318
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

471
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,019
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended...

472
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,219
if you hadn't
stopped the boat...

473
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,159
from crossing the Samdo River.

474
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,528
Could that have been a sign...

475
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:14,458
or...

476
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:18,628
Who could that man have been?

477
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:24,429
If he's lurking around me,
he could be someone I know.

478
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:29,639
A scar on his forehead?

479
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,878
I don't know such a person.

480
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,679
I'll look into it, so...

481
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:39,048
I just don't understand.

482
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,918
Why did he come after me...

483
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:43,148
and why did my parents have
to suffer because of it?

484
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:44,318
What am I anyway?

485
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,159
Yeon, why do you
keep protecting me...

486
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,559
without...

487
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,499
so much of an explanation?

488
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:05,008
Because...

489
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:09,648
I don't want you to get hurt.

490
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:14,778
I don't want you to
do anything for me.

491
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:19,418
I wish for your life...

492
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,119
to have a happy ending.

493
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:23,829
Also,

494
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,858
I'd like you to trust me.

495
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:38,409
Why don't we get
hold of that man?

496
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:41,938
How?

497
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,878
We have someone
that can serve...

498
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:47,418
as a link.

499
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,519
Why do you keep calling me?

500
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,488
Did you not see the 22
missed calls I left?

501
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,758
Do you think I'm
your girlfriend?

502
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,398
If I don't pick up, just
think that I'm busy.

503
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,499
We need to meet.

504
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,528
What are you scheming this time?

505
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,369
I just miss you. That's all.

506
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:10,969
You're obviously onto
something. I'm busy. Bye.

507
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:12,508
What are you so busy with?

508
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:15,338
Where are you right now?

509
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,179
Do you really think your brother
will tell you what he knows?

510
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:23,119
- No, of course not.
- Then what?

511
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,659
I'm going to make
Rang meet that guy.

512
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,988
How?

513
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:35,559
Hey, scribe.

514
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:38,168
Let me borrow this.

515
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,409
"Find"?

516
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:55,548
Find the man who has a criminal
branding on his forehead.

517
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:03,929
What did you just do?

518
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,858
It's like a talisman.

519
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,699
These shoes will take
Rang to that man.

520
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:14,269
We only have one shot.

521
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:18,139
Today, we must keep our eyes
on Rang no matter what happens.

522
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,338
Okay, I won't lose
him no matter what.

523
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:38,528
Go on inside.

524
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:56,378
You're here.

525
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:00,979
Why aren't you saying hello?

526
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:03,318
Did you forget the funeral?

527
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:06,389
Yeon came back a
mess because of you.

528
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,929
That's what you
call brotherly love.

529
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:13,199
By the way, that hanbok
looks nice on you.

530
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:17,199
That suit looks horrible on you.

531
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,238
You're really sensitive today.
It's starting to get me excited.

532
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:24,139
You're always so high
every time we meet.

533
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:25,369
It's like you're on drugs.

534
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,079
What are you doing at
Korean Folk Village?

535
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,378
I'm obviously not here to
do homework for school.

536
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:32,849
If you were, you
would've flunked.

537
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:34,048
Hey, old man.

538
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:37,219
I came to check something.

539
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,219
You're back.

540
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,358
What are you trying to do?

541
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:46,229
Did you come here knowing that
he's an actual fortune teller?

542
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:51,499
Anyone can tell that he's a fraud.
Just look at this fake mustache.

543
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:53,769
It's real?

544
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:56,809
He kept talking nonsense.

545
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:58,409
He does that on
purpose, you fool.

546
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:01,838
Go ahead and check.

547
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,749
There's no way he
means the most to me.

548
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:33,409
Yes, he's the most precious
thing in your life.

549
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:35,738
Your brother.

550
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:40,418
Darn it.

551
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:50,059
I'm off now.

552
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:51,958
What are you doing?

553
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:56,398
How should I put it? I'm
pretty much selling you away.

554
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:58,398
You're unbelievable.

555
00:41:58,469 --> 00:41:59,869
He'll explain what's going on.

556
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:01,568
You'll be left with nothing
else but time anyway.

557
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:03,838
I'll see you next time.

558
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,528
- Where are my shoes?
- I don't know.

559
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:28,528
Is he a kid or what?

560
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:30,769
He always turns so immature in
the most unexpected moments.

561
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:54,488
Where do you think you're going?

562
00:42:57,528 --> 00:42:59,858
- You can go first.
- Okay.

563
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,568
- Let me go.
- You're mine.

564
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:07,438
- Says who?
- A deal is a deal.

565
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:08,599
It's an unfair deal.

566
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:16,409
Yeon, hurry.

567
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,979
If you want to trick me,
you should at least...

568
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:39,068
Go on. Business is
closed for today.

569
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:40,898
Where is Yeon?

570
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,238
He joined my collection.

571
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:51,179
Will you be here
tomorrow as well?

572
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:54,548
I only do business
whenever I feel like it.

573
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,289
And the location
changes every time.

574
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,719
We only have one shot.

575
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,619
We must keep our eyes on
Rang no matter what happens.

576
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,639
In the beginning of January,

577
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,369
a man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

578
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,108
These shoes will take
Rang to that man.

579
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:22,938
Do you have feelings
for the fox?

580
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:26,179
I wish for your life
to have a happy ending.

581
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:28,079
I'd like you to trust me.

582
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,289
- Let him go.
- No.

583
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:35,889
We have our rules.

584
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,128
- Please, sir.
- What's that?

585
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:43,099
- No, wait.
- Nothing can free him.

586
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:46,398
Tell me what I need to
do to get Yeon back.

587
00:44:47,238 --> 00:44:48,469
The rules remain the same.

588
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:51,168
You can trade him with
your most precious item.

589
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:52,568
I'll do it.

590
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,708
I'll buy Yeon.

591
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:44,758
What will you give me in return?

592
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:48,858
If you don't come back
before 9pm, our deal...

593
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:51,229
will become invalid.

594
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:55,269
I have 1 hour and 40 minutes
before the clock strikes 9.

595
00:45:58,938 --> 00:46:00,008
What is it?

596
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:02,238
What's the one thing that
means the most to me?

597
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:26,168
Think.

598
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,438
Let's think.

599
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:39,349
Once the sun goes down

600
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:41,519
People get off work

601
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:45,389
But why am I still here working?

602
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,599
Hello? Open up!

603
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:02,938
Hello?

604
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,938
Hello? Hello?

605
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:18,219
Please open up! Hello?

606
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,758
Is anyone inside? Hello?

607
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:25,659
Sir!

608
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:44,608
Governor?

609
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,179
I heard a familiar voice.

610
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:47,849
It looks like it's urgent.

611
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:54,318
Thanks.

612
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:56,088
Thanks!

613
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:10,168
Wait a minute.

614
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:16,909
So? What is precious to you?

615
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,119
This.

616
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:25,289
A broken music box.

617
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:27,358
It still works though.

618
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,938
It's the last birthday present
that my parents gave me.

619
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:49,979
Is that all?

620
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:57,619
It has been exactly 21 years...

621
00:48:58,818 --> 00:49:00,258
since they went missing.

622
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,128
To be honest, my memories
grow more faint every year.

623
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:07,929
I get confused...

624
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:10,729
whether what I experienced
really happened or was a dream.

625
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,539
There's blood on this.

626
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:17,309
That's why I hung on.

627
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:21,309
"What I saw that day
was not a dream."

628
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,278
"So..."

629
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:26,079
"they may be alive."

630
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:29,679
As in, it's like the last item
connecting you to your parents.

631
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,488
I'll appraise it.

632
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:11,688
What brings you
here at this hour?

633
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,099
You're right.

634
00:50:18,528 --> 00:50:20,099
Why did I come here?

635
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:23,298
What do you mean?

636
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:27,108
Never mind. Apologies.

637
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:40,188
Don't tell me that jerk...

638
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,028
<font color="#00ff00">FIND</font>

639
00:51:00,338 --> 00:51:01,438
I will...

640
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:06,679
- not make the deal.
- What?

641
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:08,119
This isn't enough.

642
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,488
Why not? Why isn't it enough?

643
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:14,318
Because I'm not the one
that valuates items.

644
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:17,329
Please tell me.

645
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:20,199
What must I do? What...

646
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:22,929
can I do?

647
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:26,528
You are an annoying customer!

648
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:28,568
I'll repay you somehow.

649
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:32,969
- Please?
- Fine! Fine!

650
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,838
You were a princess in
your past life, not now.

651
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:38,278
You think whining will get
you everything you want.

652
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:49,088
Your hand.

653
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:50,988
Give me your hand.

654
00:51:51,988 --> 00:51:53,699
- Left hand!
- Left hand.

655
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,068
You were born with
a very special fate.

656
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,679
Water and fire may fight,

657
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:13,679
and the earth may be dark,
but metal shall rule over it.

658
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:15,979
Thus, even if you are
surrounded by darkness,

659
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,749
a moon will shine from your sky.

660
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:19,818
What does that mean?

661
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:22,519
You possess the fox bead.

662
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:27,929
That is your moon.

663
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:29,528
Sorry?

664
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,028
Give me the bead.

665
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:35,502
Give me the bead.

666
00:52:36,943 --> 00:52:39,473
Your life is overwhelmingly
blessed even without the moon.

667
00:52:39,602 --> 00:52:41,542
- So...
- I'll give it to you.

668
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,343
I don't believe in fate.

669
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,352
I see.

670
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:50,653
The deal has been made.

671
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:53,482
Sorry? Already?

672
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:54,892
The lines on your hand.

673
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:58,122
The lines have changed.

674
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:30,263
The fox bead is gone.

675
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,662
How could you beat up an old
man as soon as you got out?

676
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:41,772
He deserved it. How dare that
young punk treat me like that?

677
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:43,002
I'm much older.

678
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:46,973
How did you do it?

679
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:50,542
How else? I bought you.

680
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:52,283
With what?

681
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,122
You didn't like, give him 10
years of your life, did you?

682
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,792
No. You were much
cheaper than I expected.

683
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:08,093
So you're mine from now on.

684
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:13,973
I'm very superficial,

685
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:17,272
so I won't grant you freedom
so easily like Aladdin.

686
00:54:20,673 --> 00:54:23,743
You're a bigger
villain than Jafar.

687
00:54:36,723 --> 00:54:38,522
Why didn't you go with Rang?

688
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:41,432
It was a precious opportunity
to find your parents.

689
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:47,673
To be honest, I was torn.

690
00:54:48,772 --> 00:54:51,102
"This may be my last chance."

691
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,712
"Am I confident I
won't regret it?"

692
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:56,843
- So why did you choose me?
- Because I was confident.

693
00:54:57,883 --> 00:54:59,542
Because I felt like
I could trust you.

694
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:03,682
Because I felt like you'd
give my life a happy ending.

695
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:22,272
What are you thinking about?

696
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:24,142
I realized...

697
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:29,013
there are more moments when a child
needs her parents than I thought.

698
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:33,113
For example, when the
child takes her first step.

699
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:35,982
Who else would be that
moved that you got up...

700
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,852
and took just a few
steps by yourself?

701
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:41,653
What about for you?

702
00:55:44,263 --> 00:55:45,392
For me...

703
00:55:47,832 --> 00:55:50,633
When I was the only one at a
picnic without a homemade lunch.

704
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,133
When the kid I fought
with in class said,

705
00:55:53,203 --> 00:55:55,473
"I'm going to tell
my mom on you."

706
00:55:56,973 --> 00:55:58,872
I couldn't beat kids with moms.

707
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:03,173
What a shame. I
would've beaten them up.

708
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:07,852
I resented them a lot too.

709
00:56:08,212 --> 00:56:10,312
"Why did they leave
me all alone?"

710
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:12,982
"Why won't they come back?"

711
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:16,792
But they said it
was because of me.

712
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:19,462
The accident was because of me,

713
00:56:19,863 --> 00:56:22,863
and my parents' lives
were ruined because of me.

714
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:30,443
You can cry if you want to.

715
00:56:30,743 --> 00:56:33,772
No. I want to eat chicken feet.

716
00:56:39,642 --> 00:56:40,783
Are you okay?

717
00:56:42,113 --> 00:56:43,283
I'm not okay.

718
00:56:44,022 --> 00:56:46,082
That's why I want to
eat spicy food and cry.

719
00:56:47,122 --> 00:56:50,022
I want to be confused as
to whether it's my life...

720
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:52,662
or the spicy chicken feet
that's making me cry.

721
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,232
That's cool of you.

722
00:56:58,203 --> 00:56:59,263
What?

723
00:57:00,732 --> 00:57:03,303
I was worried that you'd
lie about being all right.

724
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,343
I'm glad.

725
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:10,343
I was worried about looking
cute instead of cool.

726
00:57:14,812 --> 00:57:16,553
- Dig in.
- Is it good?

727
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:20,622
- It's not as spicy as it looks.
- I see.

728
00:57:25,363 --> 00:57:26,493
Is this too spicy for you?

729
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:28,263
Of course not.

730
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:32,602
Something got stuck in my eye.

731
00:57:35,002 --> 00:57:36,403
I see you don't have a
tolerance for spicy food.

732
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,443
As if.

733
00:57:41,443 --> 00:57:43,173
I'm not some loser, you know.

734
00:57:48,613 --> 00:57:51,283
No, just wait.

735
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:53,653
This is my battle to fight.

736
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,022
Where are you going
at this late hour?

737
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,252
Nowhere important.

738
00:58:28,193 --> 00:58:30,562
I just have an errand to run.

739
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:39,602
Goodnight, then.

740
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:44,243
Yeon, wait.

741
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,642
Don't be so nice to me.

742
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,352
To be honest, it scares me.

743
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:58,682
Having a protector makes
me want to be dependent,

744
00:59:00,252 --> 00:59:01,953
and I'm worried...

745
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:05,392
that it'll only make me weaker.

746
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,562
So that's how you've
lived your life.

747
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:26,443
Then I promise you this.

748
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:30,653
You'll reunite
with your family...

749
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:32,622
and live out the
rest of your life.

750
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:35,823
When the time comes,

751
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:39,263
you'll forget about...

752
00:59:39,323 --> 00:59:41,732
your time with me and the
knowledge you have on my world.

753
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:47,973
You will live...

754
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:51,073
a normal human life.

755
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:01,883
You startled me.

756
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:04,082
Make your presence
known, you fool.

757
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:13,522
Granny, you know
everything, don't you?

758
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:17,803
Regarding what?

759
01:00:19,102 --> 01:00:20,303
Imoogi.

760
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,573
It still lives.

761
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:43,212
Cause and effect is the
cardinal rule of our world.

762
01:01:46,553 --> 01:01:48,593
Enough with the nonsense.

763
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:54,022
The girl was the one who
woke it up from its sleep.

764
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:58,332
And you were the one who sought
her out against my advice.

765
01:01:58,432 --> 01:01:59,703
Then it's alive.

766
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:02,633
Yes, it is.

767
01:02:05,272 --> 01:02:06,343
Then...

768
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:11,013
what was it that I fought for?

769
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:17,153
Why did A Eum have
to give her life?

770
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:19,522
It was the path you two chose.

771
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:24,493
Where is it right now?

772
01:02:24,763 --> 01:02:26,892
I've warned you
time and time again.

773
01:02:28,462 --> 01:02:30,863
Foxes and humans can
never end up together.

774
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,102
- Tell me.
- Your obsession...

775
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:38,102
- will be calamity.
- Tell me!

776
01:02:57,962 --> 01:02:59,022
Hi.

777
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:17,513
What exited the well...

778
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:20,243
went into hiding immediately.

779
01:03:22,953 --> 01:03:26,383
A piece of it was
found recently though.

780
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:30,423
What?

781
01:04:15,372 --> 01:04:18,292
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

782
01:04:18,872 --> 01:04:20,203
<i>I made a promise.</i>

783
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:21,573
<i>I'll protect her even
if it ends my life.</i>

784
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:23,412
<i>That's the thing with love.</i>

785
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,443
<i>One wrong move and it
can swallow you whole.</i>

786
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:29,682
<i>Yeon is someone I
care about now too.</i>

787
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:35,153
<i>Imoogi and Rang are
connected somehow.</i>

788
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:38,723
<i>Harm her in any way and I will
end you for good this time.</i>

789
01:04:39,263 --> 01:04:40,593
<i>Don't get swept up in this.</i>

790
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:41,962
<i>You don't want to see
the tragedy on replay.</i>

791
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:44,432
<i>But she'll be hurt
if I don't go.</i>

792
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:47,363
<i>You or the girl. One
must die in the end.</i>
