1
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,514
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

2
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,885
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

3
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,525
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

4
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:23,225
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

5
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:24,694
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

6
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,095
Please don't die.

7
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,334
Don't die...

8
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,804
because of me.

9
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:41,735
I found you.

10
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,655
I also...

11
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,625
waited for you.

12
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:35,055
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 4: I ALSO
WAITED FOR YOU</font>

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,004
I know you got
hurt because of me.

14
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,275
But I didn't think it'd be
okay to take you to a hospital.

15
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:00,085
My mom was a doctor, so I
learned how to give first aid.

16
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,495
Open your mouth.

17
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:13,794
What?

18
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,264
- Open your mouth.
- My mouth?

19
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,305
It's candy.

20
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:26,204
When I was young, my mom used
to give me strawberry candy...

21
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,974
every time I went to the
hospital to get a shot.

22
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,615
After that, I wasn't scared
of going to the hospital.

23
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,715
It just reminded me...

24
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,585
of the sweet taste
of strawberry candy.

25
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,525
Keep talking.

26
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,034
Oh, right. When I was nine,

27
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,835
I got admitted in a pediatric
mental health hospital.

28
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,375
After my parents disappeared,

29
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,645
I told the police that
the culprit isn't human.

30
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:06,645
I wanted to get discharged,
but my doctor wouldn't let me.

31
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,715
I wouldn't have let
you leave either.

32
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,954
So I kept my eyes on him.

33
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,125
And later on, I saw
him stealing propofol.

34
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,694
So what did you do?

35
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,194
So I made him a deal.

36
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,065
"Do you want me to
shout and call someone,"

37
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,565
"or will you let
me get discharged?"

38
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:27,204
I can't forget the day
I got discharged...

39
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,375
and went home in my uncle's car.

40
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,175
Mom.

41
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,045
Dad.

42
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,495
I finally came home
in three months.

43
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,904
But I didn't like being all
alone without my parents,

44
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,764
so I sat in front
of the front door.

45
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,105
And the two fireflies I saw...

46
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,204
felt as if they were my parents.

47
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,274
I also...

48
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,245
waited for you.

49
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:51,745
<font color="#00ff00">ABSTRACT ALGEBRA</font>

50
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,055
Yeon!

51
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,454
Yeon!

52
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:48,364
Look at you. You're
a complete mess.

53
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,795
You had me so worried.

54
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,805
- Will you please be quiet?
- "Be quiet"? Why?

55
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,204
Why?

56
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,275
You're the vet from...

57
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,275
Dr. Koo Shin Ju?

58
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,484
Director Nam?

59
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,415
You guys know each other?

60
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:09,555
No way.

61
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,824
What are you guys doing
together? Does that mean...

62
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,724
Yeon!

63
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,694
You finally did it!

64
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:22,035
You finally found her after
waiting like a fool for 600 years.

65
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,135
What did you call me?

66
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:25,704
Oh, sorry.

67
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,574
I'm talking gibberish
because I'm so touched.

68
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,175
Even if I die right now, I'd
be able to rest in peace.

69
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:36,175
- Are you crying?
- Why am I tearing up?

70
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:37,744
Excuse me.

71
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,454
Let me introduce myself.

72
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:51,994
I was his loyal subject ever
since he was a mountain spirit.

73
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,464
And right now, I'm
his doctor, bodyguard,

74
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,135
and housekeeper.

75
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:59,204
He doesn't even know how
to wash his own underwear.

76
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:02,275
He's only able to live a
decent life thanks to me.

77
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:03,374
Shut your mouth.

78
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,675
I finally get why you know
everything about animals.

79
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,545
You were actually a fox?

80
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,584
Don't look so close.

81
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,685
I can't trust anyone anymore.

82
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:19,025
- I interviewed you so many times.
- He's so full of himself now.

83
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,984
He made his own autograph
and practices taking selfies.

84
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:23,755
Let's just say it
was all meant to be.

85
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:28,994
My gosh.

86
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:33,704
I'll take this.

87
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,805
The bezel for this watch
is made with red gold,

88
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,374
so it's a bit expensive.
It costs 35,000 dollars.

89
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:38,744
Can I get a discount?

90
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,614
- Pardon?
- It was a joke. Wasn't it funny?

91
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,114
I've never seen you make a joke.

92
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,185
What kind of person
do I seem like to you?

93
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,555
You're the type of person
that every man wants to be.

94
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,324
From head to toe.

95
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,425
But in my eyes, I seem
like a complete wreck.

96
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,994
I'm sick of waking
up every morning.

97
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:02,895
No matter what I buy or eat,
nothing ever pleases me.

98
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,234
I must've lived
for way too long.

99
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,844
How much does that watch cost?

100
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:14,974
This one is really cheap.

101
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,744
Why do you wear
something so cheap?

102
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:18,584
It belonged to my late father.

103
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,685
It must be precious to you.

104
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:26,584
Yes, it's the most precious
thing in the world to me.

105
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,525
Give it to me.

106
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,964
Isn't the handwriting so cute?

107
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:41,065
My father never learned
to read, so I taught him.

108
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:43,874
Give me this.

109
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,474
- Pardon?
- I'll trade you for my watch.

110
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,474
You're kidding, right?

111
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,545
No. I wonder which
you'll choose.

112
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,385
Family?

113
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,484
Or...

114
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,104
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

115
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,084
Okay, okay.

116
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,785
It's chicken porridge.

117
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:33,055
It's hot. I'll
blow on it for you.

118
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,724
Hey. I'm not a child. Get away.

119
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,864
You dressed the
wounds very well.

120
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,834
Thank you. Don't you
need to do anything else?

121
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,175
He heals at a different
rate from other people.

122
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,275
But he still has to rest
for at least a month.

123
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,574
He's in your care.

124
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,015
It would be better for you to...

125
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:03,714
The power of love. That's
the most effective treatment.

126
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,785
- Sorry?
- Mr. Lee...

127
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,525
has a nasty temper, can't
express himself, and he's stingy,

128
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,724
but he's the biggest
romantic in the world.

129
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,565
He owns properties worth
over 30 million dollars.

130
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,464
He's good looking. He
has no chronic diseases.

131
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:18,765
His life expectancy
is so long, it's sick.

132
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:23,074
Leave.

133
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,744
I'm leaving. Bye.

134
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:26,905
But...

135
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,415
Give him his ice cream after
he finishes his porridge.

136
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,244
Even if he whines, okay?

137
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,854
And when he takes a bath, give him
three rubber duckies. He loves them.

138
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:41,594
- Hey, I said to leave!
- I'm leaving.

139
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:42,895
I'm leaving.

140
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,305
What is that?

141
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,744
Something that was...

142
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,785
the most precious thing to a
young man until a moment ago.

143
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,515
He doesn't have anything
like that anymore.

144
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,755
Just like me.

145
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,275
What? What is it?

146
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,844
Give me come.

147
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,055
What are you thinking about?

148
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,824
Just...

149
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,795
that something simple like
ice cream could make life...

150
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:27,895
this sweet.

151
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,474
What was your first love like?

152
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:38,905
What kind of a person was she?

153
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:42,344
Not something like she
was pretty like a lotus.

154
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,984
Her name was A Eum,
which meant "high sound".

155
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,385
A Eum.

156
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:49,655
That was her name.

157
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,755
She didn't have a tacky name
like people used to back then.

158
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:55,724
She must have been from
a wealthy family then.

159
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,025
How did you meet?

160
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,765
Unforgettably.

161
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,104
She treated me like a dog.

162
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,275
Do you want to die?

163
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:19,315
That's odd. Our pet dog
loves it when I do this.

164
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:21,854
What? How dare you?
Do you know who I am?

165
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,454
You're a fox, right? I'm A Eum.

166
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,025
Don't come back here again.

167
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,864
- Why not?
- This is a spirit's resting place.

168
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,295
Why?

169
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:35,535
Are you stupid?

170
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,935
Why?

171
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,364
They say the nine-tailed
fly across the sky.

172
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:08,765
You must be very powerful.

173
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,765
Now that you know, scram.

174
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:12,364
Unless you want
to be tiger food.

175
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,834
I want you to serve me.

176
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,545
- What?
- I'll feed you rice every day.

177
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:20,945
I'll clothe you in silk too.

178
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,914
You'll live in luxury. Okay?

179
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,245
How cute.

180
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,315
She was too cute, so I gave
her a noogie and sent her away.

181
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,854
- And?
- And...

182
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,684
she went down, crying, and
came back within the day.

183
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,725
She's a persistent one.

184
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,124
Who won?

185
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:39,894
I let her win.

186
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:43,164
I was incredibly
magnanimous at the time.

187
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,894
Of course, I still am now.

188
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,364
I'm very magnanimous.

189
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:53,275
If you miss again,
I'm going to eat you.

190
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:03,114
Why can't you do
something this easy?

191
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:06,525
I told you. Shooting an arrow
is about riding the wind.

192
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,624
And I told you, I'm the
master of that wind.

193
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,594
- Let's do it again.
- You have no talent.

194
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:17,265
Human. Just go and do
embroidery or fly a kite, okay?

195
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,664
Don't you dare order me around.

196
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:23,074
You're testing my patience.

197
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,144
Look at this kid. Who are
you to have patience with me?

198
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,545
Throw it.

199
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:41,624
It wasn't that I couldn't
hit it, I didn't.

200
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,824
I didn't want you to get hurt.

201
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,225
Who are you to worry about me?

202
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:51,035
I like you.

203
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,334
You little human. Do you want
to be struck by lightning?

204
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,485
Isn't it time to tell me?

205
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,854
Why must it be an arrow?

206
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,465
Don't give me garbage
like, "Because it's cool."

207
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,765
I'm going to kill my father.

208
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,975
What? Your father?

209
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,674
Why? Who's your father?

210
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,344
He's the king of this nation.

211
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:55,795
Shoot.

212
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,965
As long as I'm around,
the wind belongs to you.

213
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:05,975
What an impressive first love.

214
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:10,674
It turned out she was the
king's seventh daughter.

215
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,844
An abandoned princess.

216
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:16,815
But why did she want
to kill her own father?

217
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:20,684
He was a king, and
yet not a king.

218
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:22,394
What?

219
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:27,124
Screams were heard
daily from the palace,

220
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,695
and hardship and suffering
were unending on the peninsula.

221
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:36,005
An evil being was in the palace
pretending to be the king.

222
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,104
An evil being?

223
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:40,844
Back in the day, people
called it the earth dragon.

224
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:42,674
Earth dragon?

225
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:45,545
A dragon buried in the ground...

226
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,245
Do you mean Imoogi?

227
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:52,285
My gosh. You are even
better looking in person.

228
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:53,555
You're very handsome.

229
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:55,225
Thank you.

230
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,025
No, thank you.

231
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:00,465
You sent a very generous
advance payment in cash.

232
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:03,094
- Does anyone know...
- Definitely not.

233
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:06,505
Anyway, whose child
is the baby...

234
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,305
that you're so secretive...

235
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:13,005
Actually, who cares
whose child the baby is?

236
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,545
All babies are angels.

237
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,844
The kid's room is the last
one on the second floor.

238
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:20,715
I see.

239
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,215
Then what should I do first?

240
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,555
As of now,

241
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,285
he only needs his meal.

242
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,854
Yes, of course.

243
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,354
Kid?

244
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,765
It's time for your meal.

245
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:19,174
Do you perhaps have
trouble hearing?

246
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,555
My gosh, your face...

247
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,025
Your wrist too.

248
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,725
Please don't tell me
that this is contagious.

249
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:38,394
I don't know.

250
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:41,424
How about you see for yourself?

251
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,275
What about the
rest of the story?

252
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:27,144
I never recollect
any more than that.

253
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,545
How did she die?

254
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,775
Your obsession will
bring about calamity.

255
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:34,745
To both you and
her who was reborn.

256
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:39,084
It's none of your business.

257
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,195
But it is. I know it is.

258
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:47,795
At times,

259
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,134
it's better to be in the dark.

260
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:57,374
So live your life as the
clueless person you have been.

261
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,005
I don't intend to live...

262
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,945
as the past version of
someone I do not know.

263
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,614
No, not yet!

264
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:16,924
It's fine. I've rested enough.

265
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,225
Let's get some fresh air.

266
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,574
It's hideous, isn't it?

267
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:37,815
I actually like it.

268
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:39,584
It suits you.

269
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,015
But I don't.

270
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:44,985
It's like I'm telling the
world that I was in a zoo.

271
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:48,184
- Says who?
- That veterinarian.

272
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:51,955
Unlike other men, he
doesn't push himself on me.

273
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,995
He looks at me with pity
and sadness in his eyes.

274
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,695
Then don't make him
look at you that way.

275
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:58,065
How?

276
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,364
How can one see without eyes?

277
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,245
Stop the car.

278
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:13,084
Let's raise the pot
from 5 dollars to 10.

279
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,515
- I'm in.
- It's mine anyway.

280
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:17,055
Here I go.

281
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,854
- No way.
- See that?

282
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,795
- Okay!
- What did I tell you?

283
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:26,465
Wait, it's not dead yet though.

284
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:27,795
- Hey!
- You're over the line.

285
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:29,995
- Take a step back.
- I'm not over the line.

286
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,005
Having fun, are we?

287
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:38,475
What the...

288
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:40,574
That's not how you
respond to your elders.

289
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,104
I asked if you were having fun.

290
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,745
Is he serious?

291
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:46,344
What's it to you anyway? Let go.

292
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:48,584
Let go of me!

293
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:53,584
How did such weaklings reach
the top of the food chain?

294
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,324
Don't just stand there!

295
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,164
- Hi, guys.
- And who might you be?

296
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,505
Did you just swear at me?

297
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,535
Die, die!

298
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:11,005
You're... You're bleeding.

299
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:13,975
Why you...

300
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:27,755
It stings, doesn't it?

301
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,904
You can't start
weeping just yet.

302
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,934
I have all the time
in the world, you see.

303
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:50,144
<font color="#00ff00">YEONGJU HANEUL FUNERAL HALL</font>

304
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,015
A morgue.

305
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:00,384
Nothing can top this as
a place for an outing.

306
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,555
It's quiet...

307
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:03,025
and has coffins.

308
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,824
Sorry about this, but
I can never let go...

309
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,424
of anything that bothers me.

310
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:11,695
Okay.

311
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:18,374
Come out.

312
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,545
Come on out.

313
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,684
- Hey, it's a fox.
- A fox.

314
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,795
Yes, I'm a fox.

315
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:38,195
Young sisters,
please come closer.

316
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:41,324
It's all right. Come this way.

317
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,535
That's it. Come closer.

318
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:46,404
Yes, that's close enough.

319
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,434
First of all, you
deserve this each.

320
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,745
Spirits shouldn't
cling onto humans.

321
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,644
Especially this human.

322
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,114
Ask away then.

323
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,525
What are your names?

324
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,725
- I'm Min Seo.
- I'm Yeon Seo.

325
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:14,124
Min Seo and Yeon Seo, you
have something to say to me.

326
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:27,344
Are you the victims
of this accident?

329
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:44,495
Have you read this?

330
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:49,065
The reporters are adding
fuel to the flame.

331
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,834
Darn it!

00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:37,775
I'd rather not choose.

340
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:39,384
Why are you doing this to us?

341
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,985
This being a pastime of mine
is none of your business.

342
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:44,455
- Please don't kill us.
- Fine, you choose.

343
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:47,584
I made these myself.

344
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,195
Chance cards that are
either good or bad.

345

The probability is 50-50.

346

What are those?

347
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:55,765
Just pick one.

348
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:09,228
I made these myself.

349
00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:10,828
Chance cards that are
either good or bad.

350
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,397

351

What are those?

352
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,597
Just pick one.

353
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:34,818
You picked an interesting one.

00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:39,328
Congratulations.

357
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:44,627
What are you guys good at?

358
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,897
We're good at playing baseball.

359
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:49,498
We're baseball players.

360
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,568
I love baseball.

361
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:53,367
If you let us go,
we'll teach you well.

362
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,407
Yes, we will.

363
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,078
I know what you
guys are thinking,

364
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,877
but that's not it.

365
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:03,718
You won't be able to play baseball
for the rest of your lives.

366
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,288
In other words, you'll literally
be donating your talents.

367
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:13,127
Are you all right-handed?

368
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:15,758
He looks left-handed to me.

369
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:20,127
Gosh, whatever. Yu Ri, just
break both of their hands.

370
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,538
- Let's go.
- No, please.

371
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:25,097
- We're sorry!
- We won't do it again!

372
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:27,207
- We promise we won't do it again!
- Please don't do this to us!

373
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:28,508
- Please!
- No, don't!

374
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,808
We won't do it again!

375
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:32,278
Please...

376
00:31:37,778 --> 00:31:39,417
Who... Who are you?

377
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:42,218
I was close with Min
Seo and Yeon Seo.

378
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:45,417
Oh, I see.

379
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,357
I'm a truck driver, you see.

380
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:52,357
So I'm rarely ever home.

381
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,468
Yes, I know. I also know
that your brother...

382
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:58,268
took care of the kids
when you weren't home.

383
00:31:58,338 --> 00:32:01,637
My brother happened to have
a job interview that day.

384
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,548
Do you know that
there are cherries...

385
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,207
inside the bag?

386
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:13,647
You must've been really
close with my kids.

387
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,758
These cherries were
quite expensive.

388
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:23,957
But they didn't
even touch them...

389
00:32:23,957 --> 00:32:26,597
because they didn't like
anything I got for them.

390
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:47,647
Will you come with
me for a moment?

391
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:50,417
Help!

392
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:54,088
How do you think it'll
feel to get burned alive?

393
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,798
I heard this is about 1000°C.

394
00:32:57,857 --> 00:33:00,367
Gosh, it's so hot. You're the reason
why I'm here feeling all this heat.

395
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:03,097
Please... Why are
you doing this to me?

396
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,397
You did something bad to
your nieces, didn't you?

397
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:08,437
No, I didn't. Who told you that?

398
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:12,508
- Just go inside.
- No, wait! Wait!

399
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,278
Wait! Yes, you're right.

400
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:16,718
I did it. It was me.
Please don't kill me.

401
00:33:17,017 --> 00:33:18,278
You sexually molested
them, didn't you?

402
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,057
Yes, but I swear
I didn't mean to.

403
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,588
I was too drunk.

404
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,528
I didn't mean to kill them.

405
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:31,057
But the kids ran
to the balcony...

406
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:32,298
That's good enough.

407
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:41,107
You piece of trash!

408
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,508
The police are on
their way here.

409
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,448
I can't believe I had no idea.

410
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:50,678
I was such a fool.

411
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:58,088
Sir, the reason Min
Seo and Yeon Seo...

412
00:33:58,158 --> 00:33:59,988
didn't eat any of
those cherries...

413
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:03,258
wasn't because they
didn't like you.

414
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:10,167
They just thought the
cherries were too precious.

415
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,368
They couldn't eat them because
they wanted to cherish...

416
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,738
what you got for them.

417
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:27,318
I'm so sorry.

418
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:05,488
He must like you.

419
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,687
I can't believe he's
wagging its tail...

420
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:10,957
even after what
he's been through.

421
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,568
He's so dumb and foolish.

422
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:15,127
I feel so bad for him.

423
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,437
Why don't we take him with us?

424
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:22,707
Oh, no.

425
00:35:24,577 --> 00:35:26,647
Why did you come back?

426
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,408
I told you to run far away.

427
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:33,548
Does it hurt?

428
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:36,787
Oh, my gosh.

429
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:39,658
There was only one
thing I could do.

430
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:43,857
And that was to end
the pain myself.

431
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:47,098
No.

432
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:49,028
I can't do it.

433
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,368
I don't want to.

434
00:35:54,338 --> 00:35:56,807
Yeon. Help.

435
00:35:58,107 --> 00:35:59,278
Yeon!

436
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:11,687
Geomdoong.

437
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:13,888
Here.

438
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,258
I'm so excited.

439
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:19,868
Give him a lot of love, and
take good care of him, okay?

440
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,997
Okay, Yeon.

441
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,468
I'm so excited. You're
excited too, right?

442
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:27,968
Good boy.

443
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,167
Run faster.

444
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:33,548
I never should've
let him grow on me.

445
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,008
I never should've
given him a name.

446
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,577
I never should've slept
with him in my arms.

447
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:43,888
The day Yeon left the
forest, I lost everything...

448
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:45,988
that was precious to me.

449
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:49,698
Let's take him with us. Please.

450
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,298
No.

451
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:54,568
Why not?

452
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,638
I don't like dogs. Their
life span is too short.

453
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,077
Let's go.

454
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,178
Goodbye.

455
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:15,218
Farewell.

456
00:37:45,118 --> 00:37:47,988
Hey, go play somewhere else.

457
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:50,888
Go on.

458
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:55,988
Get going.

459
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:10,008
Who were those kids?

460
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:13,848
This used to be a
grave for little kids.

461
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:15,247
They need to resolve
their resentment...

462
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,318
in order to leave
the Living Realm.

463
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,477
But it's too late.

464
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:20,687
I guess they died
a long time ago.

465
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:25,017
Back in the old days, they didn't
make gravestones for kids...

466
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:27,957
so that their parents
wouldn't be able to find them.

467
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:30,727
That's sad.

468
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:33,568
It's a sad custom that
was created in the past...

469
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:36,698
to prevent parents from dwelling
on their children's deaths.

470
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:38,798
Just like now,

471
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:41,537
parents were devastated to have
their children die so young.

472
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:59,017
You keep looking at me. Why?

473
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:00,528
No reason.

474
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,827
You just seem a little
different today.

475
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,968
You were the one who helped those
sisters resolve their resentment.

476
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:10,767
Thank you.

477
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,207
For what?

478
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,238
For everything.

479
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:28,917
My gosh.

480
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,787
Is it going to be
a meal or alcohol?

481
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:38,727
You told me humans treat people
to things when they're grateful.

482
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,338
I prefer alcohol.

483
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:53,778
Didn't you bring an
umbrella earlier?

484
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:55,848
I lost it.

485
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:58,877
- Are you stupid?
- Yes, I'm stupid.

486
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:00,718
No wonder.

487
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:03,687
You didn't sound very clever
when you interviewed me.

488
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:25,267
What? Why is a tree...

489
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:27,537
Let's go.

490
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:39,048
You always carry this
umbrella with you.

491
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,888
I hate getting wet.
It's bad for the fur.

492
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:45,388
It must be like how
dogs hate taking baths.

493
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:46,787
- Right. Hey.
- Yes.

494
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,827
I caught you because
of this umbrella.

495
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:53,698
I let you catch me.

496
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:54,727
Whatever.

497
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:56,968
Like I can't lose
someone you if I tried?

498
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:03,807
Even if it pours like
this, I eat chicken.

499
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:06,008
Shin Ju likes chicken.

500
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:07,107
Hey.

501
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:10,017
Why were you out
during business hours?

502
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,818
I was bored out of my mind.

503
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:14,118
What... What brings
you here today?

504
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:18,318
Treat him.

505
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:39,138
How is he?

506
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:41,348
His bone was crushed.

507
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,678
He's malnourished
and has skin disease.

508
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:45,678
The leash dug into his skin.

509
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,488
Where's my necklace?

510
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:52,787
I need to talk to him.

511
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:55,658
Hurry.

512
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,127
Darn it.

513
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,238
What happened?

514
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:10,178
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

515
00:43:10,937 --> 00:43:13,607
Yes. So she didn't do it?

516
00:43:14,348 --> 00:43:15,377
Okay.

517
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:18,017
He isn't a pet.

518
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:20,988
I stole him. I thought he'd
be better off being a pet.

519
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,057
- Yu Ri.
- What?

520
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:25,658
You did good.

521
00:43:26,658 --> 00:43:29,857
I didn't like the necklace
thief, but I like the dog thief.

522
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:32,727
- Dog thief?
- I can't do it even if I wanted to.

523
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:34,497
I can't cross the line.

524
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:38,868
I have no boundaries.

525
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:41,167
If you don't mind,
would you wait there?

526
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,687
It's okay.

527
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,457
It's okay.

528
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:17,377
How could you not
watch "Toy Story 3"?

529
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:22,977
When Woody stays behind and
watches Andy leave, and goes,

530
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,417
"So long, partner."

531
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:25,548
How could you not know that?

532
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:27,588
Isn't that a kids' movie?

533
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,388
It made adults
around the world cry.

534
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:33,957
I can't stand it when people
cry while watching a movie.

535
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:38,198
- Then which movie do you like?
- Me?

536
00:44:39,298 --> 00:44:41,627
"Mad Max", "Avengers",

537
00:44:41,798 --> 00:44:44,667
and every zombie movie
that ever existed.

538
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:48,937
I see. What's your
favorite type of music?

539
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,307
Anything by a boy
band, of course.

540
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:53,707
- What about classical music?
- I can't distinguish the singers.

541
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:54,948
Not singers, composers.

542
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:58,048
- Hiking.
- Not even if someone carries me.

543
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:01,348
Single malt whiskey.

544
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,848
I'd rather drink cold medicine.

545
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:06,258
- Korean food or western food?
- Always Korean food.

546
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:07,327
Me too.

547
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:15,698
You don't have many
friends, right?

548
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,798
Me neither.

549
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,207
We're a good match.

550
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:25,278
"You Quiz on the Block"
or "Amazing Saturday"?

551
00:45:25,278 --> 00:45:27,678
- "Amazing Saturday"!
- "Amazing Saturday"!

552
00:45:49,368 --> 00:45:51,838
Yeon, what is your dream?

553
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:55,638
A future dream? At this age?

554
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:59,738
You know, like opening
a cafe after you retire.

555
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,348
Coffee tastes the best
when someone else makes it.

556
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:04,477
Like traveling around the world.

557
00:46:04,477 --> 00:46:08,017
I'm a homebody, so I prefer
watching videos at home.

558
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,687
Saving up a million dollars.

559
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:10,758
A million dollars?

560
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:13,588
What's your account number?
I'll transfer it now.

561
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:17,798
Put that away.

562
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:20,057
- What? I can do smart banking.
- No.

563
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:36,278
If something that can never
come true can be a dream,

564
00:46:37,877 --> 00:46:38,977
I want...

565
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:42,017
to become human.

566
00:46:46,057 --> 00:46:50,028
Gosh. This nine-tailed
fox got spoiled by luxury.

567
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:53,357
If you want to know what
it's like to be human,

568
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,428
take the subway
during rush hour.

569
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,468
The Underworld is
closer than you think.

570
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:02,437
That's not all. You work
late, pull all-nighters,

571
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:05,008
listen to your boss nag,
which is all he ever does,

572
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:07,207
and the stress about
ratings pummel down on you.

573
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,107
- Should I get rid of it?
- What?

574
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:11,647
The TV station. You
said it torments you.

575
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:18,957
Whereas that is a
very novel approach,

576
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:21,727
let's drink first and
then think about it.

577
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:37,877
What about you?
What's your dream?

578
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:42,747
For me...

579
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:49,647
I'm fine if I live in a hut,

580
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,758
but I wish my my mom and
dad will be with me...

581
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:56,488
in my future.

582
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:12,638
Do you have a picture
of your parents?

583
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:14,977
Send me one.

584
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:30,827
Are you okay?

585
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:34,368
It's so dark.

586
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,627
The street lamps are out.

587
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,767
- Can't you do things like that?
- What?

588
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:43,307
It would be so cool if you
could use your powers...

589
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:44,778
to fix them.

590
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,607
Submit a request with
the local authority.

591
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,008
What a useless nine-tailed fox.

592
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,077
Shin Ju closes the clinic
and comes running...

593
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:53,348
if a light blows out in my home.

594
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,088
He trained you all wrong.

595
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:58,187
Even a nine-tailed fox
is afraid of electricity.

596
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:05,428
- We're here.
- Yes, we are.

597
00:49:10,468 --> 00:49:13,138
- Okay, bye now.
- Okay. Go on in.

598
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:15,767
Hey.

599
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:21,307
Good night.

600
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:23,348
You too. Good night.

601
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,718
It was Yeon...

602
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:07,787
back then too.

603
00:50:40,729 --> 00:50:42,860
<font color="#00ff00">THE SITE OF GOBLINS CAN
BRING LUCK OR CALAMITY.</font>

604
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,630
<font color="#00ff00">NOODLES, SAMGYETANG</font>

605
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,300
<font color="#00ff00">VIEWER BULLETIN BOARD</font>

606
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:56,780
"I can't reach a
babysitter I know."

607
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:01,087
Ms. Kim, have you
read this story?

608
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,427
I'm in the zone,
so don't bother me.

609
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:05,826
- It'll only take a second.
- Leave me alone.

610
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,867
What's there to work on when you
copy and paste your own pieces?

611
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:10,567
I dare you to say that again.

612
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:14,206
I heard him loud and clear.
He said, "copy and paste."

613
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:15,337
Ms. Nam!

614
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,407
Don't you know that the pen
is mightier than the sword?

615
00:51:17,637 --> 00:51:20,306
Today, you and I will both
take our last breaths.

616
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,117
Don't they get sick
and tired of that?

617
00:51:30,146 --> 00:51:32,617
All right. So from now on,

618
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:36,087
you will build a stone tower
in the Underworld for Children.

619
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:39,096
When it's all built, a
goblin will appear...

620
00:51:39,157 --> 00:51:40,626
and knock it all down,

621
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,396
but you must keep on
stacking the stones.

622
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,637
It's how you can
someday be reincarnated.

623
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,837
I don't want to go there.

624
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,806
My sister brushes her teeth
well and listens to our dad.

625
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,306
It may be called
as an Underworld,

626
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,476
but you'll be playing a
game of stacking blocks.

627
00:51:57,677 --> 00:51:59,876
Just imagine how fun it'll be...

628
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:02,117
to play this game
with your sister?

629
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,956
I don't like stacking blocks.

630
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:06,657
My sister doesn't want to.

631
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:09,956
I'm afraid you have
no choice though.

632
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:13,496
Can I watch cartoons
in the Underworld?

633
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:15,496
You can't.

634
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:22,337
Then can I bring
this toy with me?

635
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:38,587
Objects from the Living
Realm aren't allowed.

636
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,387
I'm sorry, my dear.

637
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:45,826
Must you really be
this inconsiderate?

638
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:51,067
Always such a
stickler for rules.

639
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:53,067
Why not ban the dead
from receiving money too?

640
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,766
My thoughts exactly.

641
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,436
You, stay out of this.

642
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,076
Take the children
to the Underworld.

643
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,646
Got it. Kids, this way.

644
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:06,317
This way, please.

645
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:15,056
Kiddo, take good
care of your sister.

646
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:22,297
What a sap.

647
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:23,626
This way, please.

648
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:29,436
Is the Underworld for
Children still in operation?

649
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,576
They must be punished for
breaking their parents' hearts.

650
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:34,576
Isn't it bad that their
lives ended early?

651
00:53:34,576 --> 00:53:36,547
Must they be framed
as unfilial as well?

652
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:40,887
It's to quicken the process
of their reincarnation.

653
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,056
The Afterlife desperately
needs a face-lift too.

654
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:46,786
We need a younger King
Hades for starters.

655
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:50,326
And a trip to the Underworld
of Tongue Ripping...

656
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:52,556
will snap some sense
into your head.

657
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:56,027
Again with the torture. This
isn't the Middle Age anymore.

658
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,396
Ripping of tongues in an era...

659
00:53:58,396 --> 00:54:00,036
where we now brief
the dead via monitors?

660
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,376
Did you come by to pick a
fight with me this morning?

661
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:06,936
Of course not.

662
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:10,846
Here you go. It's
an iced Americano.

663
00:54:16,947 --> 00:54:18,887
What do I need to do
to locate someone?

664
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,797
Are you a PI on the side now?

665
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:29,626
Here.

666
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,936
I already checked the
list for their names.

667
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:36,536
They're not dead but haven't
been in contact for 20 years.

668
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,806
- So?
- Let me use the Clairvoyance once.

669
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:42,947
Get that out of my face.

670
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:44,346
You know where they are, right?

671
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:46,547
- I don't.
- Don't be...

672
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,317
so stingy with your powers.

673
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,257
I meant that I can't see them.

674
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:01,297
- What?
- Those who I can't see...

675
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,967
They're not in the Afterlife
or the Living Realm.

676
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:10,806
I'd ask the ones who
initially took them.

677
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:11,907
Who took them?

678
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,076
And who may that be?

679
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:17,817
Why does my list of assignments
keep getting longer?

680
00:55:20,947 --> 00:55:22,987
I know that this is to
keep food on the table,

681
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:25,056
- but you take it too far.
- Sandwiches.

682
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:26,487
Guys, stop!

683
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:28,587
Here comes the president
of our network.

684
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,726
It's been a while.

685
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,096
Hello, sir.

686
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,297
Has the job been fun lately?

687
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:43,137
We work to earn paychecks,
not to have fun.

688
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:44,576
You're as feisty as ever.

689
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:46,637
I heard your show had the
highest ratings last month.

690
00:55:46,706 --> 00:55:48,876
That's right, so treat
us to a meal, sir.

691
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:51,846
Sure. I'll take your whole
team out for a meal soon.

692
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:55,317
Thank you, sir.

693
00:55:58,757 --> 00:55:59,857
Have a good day!

694
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:08,596
Pubyokru of the Taedong river.

695
00:56:09,396 --> 00:56:15,567
I miss sailing.

696
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:18,237
Who sails these days?

697
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,536
We now enjoy beer to the
crashing of the waves.

698
00:56:20,607 --> 00:56:22,677
What nonsense are you spewing...

699
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:26,076
You're the old
totem, aren't you?

700
00:56:27,277 --> 00:56:28,416
I am,

701
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:30,916
but I prefer makgeolli
over beer now.

702
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:35,657
You should know better than
to show your back to me.

703
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:41,766
I heard you're the
totem of Yeou Gogae.

704
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:43,996
I'm looking for some people.

705
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,907
Have you seen them before?

706
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:52,976
Yes or no?

707
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:54,277
I don't know.

708
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,447
I won't ask this again.

709
00:56:57,516 --> 00:56:58,876
I really don't know!

710
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:06,617
You should've answered
me when I asked nicely...

711
00:57:06,617 --> 00:57:08,226
instead of being
an intolerant brat.

712
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:11,197
So you're saying that someone
else knows about them?

713
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,496
Who may that be?

714
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,266
The g...

715
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:20,867
Louder, please.

716
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:22,436
The governor!

717
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:24,507
The governor?

718
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:32,076
For some reason,

719
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,177
the president of the
network only addresses you.

720
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:35,887
I know.

721
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:39,016
What's your secret?

722
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:42,857
For one, grow some balls.

723
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,826
That simple, is it?

724
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:48,567
You'll see once
you're at my rank.

725
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,896
Meeting the president from
an administrative position?

726
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,837
You'll cower just like me.

727
00:57:55,107 --> 00:57:56,266
It's not like you to
eat honey-garlic bread.

728
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,206
When life takes you on
a roller coaster ride,

729
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:00,706
nothing grounds you like the
combination of sweet and salty.

730
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:02,206
Want some?

731
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:06,646
What flavor is that?

732
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,686
Blueberry. But don't you dare.

733
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:11,087
I'll let you once
you quit smoking.

734
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:13,387
You're such a jerk,
you know that?

735
00:58:17,387 --> 00:58:19,157
Is this for real or am I
living in virtual reality?

736
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,867
Fit as a model and
just as handsome.

737
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:25,596
He also drives a sweet car.

738
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:34,846
Meanwhile, what's in
front of me is a tragedy.

739
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:36,076
That's verbal
harassment, you know.

740
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:39,777
Let's go.

741
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:42,416
Why are you here?

742
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:44,956
But...

743
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:46,456
What the...

744
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:50,657
What on earth?

745
00:58:50,857 --> 00:58:52,427
- Where are we going?
- Just get in.

746
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,797
Hurry.

747
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:04,306
What just happened?

748
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:06,436
Beats me.

749
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:13,447
Where are we going?

750
00:59:13,976 --> 00:59:15,387
To make your dream come true.

751
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:17,987
No way.

752
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:20,286
I even picked out some
songs you might like.

753
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:27,867
<font color="#00ff00">"NEWTON" BY MONSTA X</font>

754
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:51,416
I'm looking for something.

755
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:54,257
What... What is it?

756
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:55,726
The eyebrows of a tiger.

757
00:59:56,286 --> 00:59:59,326
- That's just a legend.
- So am I.

758
00:59:59,326 --> 01:00:01,726
But I'm right here
holding onto your collar.

759
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,197
I'm only going to ask you once.

760
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,596
Did you see it or not?

761
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,536
No, I never saw it.

762
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:10,036
Really? Then you'll
just have to fall.

763
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:13,907
No, wait! Wait!

764
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:17,376
Wait! Wait a minute!

765
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:23,646
Those darn foxes.

766
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,697
Come and check this out!

767
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:45,137
Consider yourself lucky!

768
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:47,607
I'm doing this because I
never got to get married.

769
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:53,246
Check it out! 1, 2...

770
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:56,146
Over here!

771
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:04,087
Wait here for a moment. I
need to take a look around.

772
01:01:04,697 --> 01:01:07,056
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,166
I promise...

776
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:04,907
to find you.

777
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,846
Where were you? I looked
