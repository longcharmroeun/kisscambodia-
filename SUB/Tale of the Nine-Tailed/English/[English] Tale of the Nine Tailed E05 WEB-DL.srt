00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,145

11
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:06,614
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

12
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,015
Please don't die.

13
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:50,254
Don't die...

14
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,724
because of me.

15
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,655
I found you.

16
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,575
I also...

17
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,545
waited for you.

18
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:16,975
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 4: I ALSO
WAITED FOR YOU</font>

19
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,924
I know you got
hurt because of me.

20
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,195
But I didn't think it'd be
okay to take you to a hospital.

21
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:42,005
My mom was a doctor, so I
learned how to give first aid.

22
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,415
Open your mouth.

23
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,714
What?

24
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,184
- Open your mouth.
- My mouth?

25
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,225
It's candy.

26
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,124
When I was young, my mom used
to give me strawberry candy...

27
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:10,894
every time I went to the
hospital to get a shot.

28
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,535
After that, I wasn't scared
of going to the hospital.

29
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,635
It just reminded me...

30
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,505
of the sweet taste
of strawberry candy.

31
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,445
Keep talking.

32
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,954
Oh, right. When I was nine,

33
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,755
I got admitted in a pediatric
mental health hospital.

34
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,295
After my parents disappeared,

35
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,565
I told the police that
the culprit isn't human.

36
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:48,565
I wanted to get discharged,
but my doctor wouldn't let me.

37
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,635
I wouldn't have let
you leave either.

38
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,874
So I kept my eyes on him.

39
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:56,045
And later on, I saw
him stealing propofol.

40
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:57,614
So what did you do?

41
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,114
So I made him a deal.

42
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:01,985
"Do you want me to
shout and call someone,"

43
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:03,485
"or will you let
me get discharged?"

44
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:09,124
I can't forget the day
I got discharged...

45
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,295
and went home in my uncle's car.

46
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,095
Mom.

47
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,965
Dad.

48
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,415
I finally came home
in three months.

49
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,824
But I didn't like being all
alone without my parents,

50
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,684
so I sat in front
of the front door.

51
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,025
And the two fireflies I saw...

52
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,124
felt as if they were my parents.

53
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,194
I also...

54
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:02,165
waited for you.

55
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:33,665
<font color="#00ff00">ABSTRACT ALGEBRA</font>

56
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,975
Yeon!

57
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,374
Yeon!

58
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,284
Look at you. You're
a complete mess.

59
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,715
You had me so worried.

60
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,725
- Will you please be quiet?
- "Be quiet"? Why?

61
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,124
Why?

62
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,195
You're the vet from...

63
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,195
Dr. Koo Shin Ju?

64
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,404
Director Nam?

65
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,335
You guys know each other?

66
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,475
No way.

67
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,744
What are you guys doing
together? Does that mean...

68
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,644
Yeon!

69
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:01,614
You finally did it!

70
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,955
You finally found her after
waiting like a fool for 600 years.

71
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,055
What did you call me?

72
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,624
Oh, sorry.

73
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,494
I'm talking gibberish
because I'm so touched.

74
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:14,095
Even if I die right now, I'd
be able to rest in peace.

75
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:18,095
- Are you crying?
- Why am I tearing up?

76
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,664
Excuse me.

77
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,374
Let me introduce myself.

78
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:33,914
I was his loyal subject ever
since he was a mountain spirit.

79
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:36,384
And right now, I'm
his doctor, bodyguard,

80
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,055
and housekeeper.

81
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:41,124
He doesn't even know how
to wash his own underwear.

82
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:44,195
He's only able to live a
decent life thanks to me.

83
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:45,294
Shut your mouth.

84
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:50,595
I finally get why you know
everything about animals.

85
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:52,465
You were actually a fox?

86
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,504
Don't look so close.

87
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,605
I can't trust anyone anymore.

88
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:00,945
- I interviewed you so many times.
- He's so full of himself now.

89
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,904
He made his own autograph
and practices taking selfies.

90
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:05,675
Let's just say it
was all meant to be.

91
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:10,914
My gosh.

92
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:15,624
I'll take this.

93
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:17,725
The bezel for this watch
is made with red gold,

94
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,294
so it's a bit expensive.
It costs 35,000 dollars.

95
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,664
Can I get a discount?

96
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:24,534
- Pardon?
- It was a joke. Wasn't it funny?

97
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,034
I've never seen you make a joke.

98
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,105
What kind of person
do I seem like to you?

99
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:34,475
You're the type of person
that every man wants to be.

100
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,244
From head to toe.

101
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,345
But in my eyes, I seem
like a complete wreck.

102
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,914
I'm sick of waking
up every morning.

103
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:44,815
No matter what I buy or eat,
nothing ever pleases me.

104
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,154
I must've lived
for way too long.

105
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,764
How much does that watch cost?

106
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:56,894
This one is really cheap.

107
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:58,664
Why do you wear
something so cheap?

108
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:00,504
It belonged to my late father.

109
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,605
It must be precious to you.

110
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,504
Yes, it's the most precious
thing in the world to me.

111
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,445
Give it to me.

112
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,884
Isn't the handwriting so cute?

113
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,985
My father never learned
to read, so I taught him.

114
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,794
Give me this.

115
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,394
- Pardon?
- I'll trade you for my watch.

116
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:32,394
You're kidding, right?

117
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,465
No. I wonder which
you'll choose.

118
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:38,305
Family?

119
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,404
Or...

120
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,024
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

121
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,004
Okay, okay.

122
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,705
It's chicken porridge.

123
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,975
It's hot. I'll
blow on it for you.

124
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,644
Hey. I'm not a child. Get away.

125
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,784
You dressed the
wounds very well.

126
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,754
Thank you. Don't you
need to do anything else?

127
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,095
He heals at a different
rate from other people.

128
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,195
But he still has to rest
for at least a month.

129
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:38,494
He's in your care.

130
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,935
It would be better for you to...

131
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:45,634
The power of love. That's
the most effective treatment.

132
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,705
- Sorry?
- Mr. Lee...

133
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,445
has a nasty temper, can't
express himself, and he's stingy,

134
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,644
but he's the biggest
romantic in the world.

135
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,485
He owns properties worth
over 30 million dollars.

136
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:58,384
He's good looking. He
has no chronic diseases.

137
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,685
His life expectancy
is so long, it's sick.

138
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,994
Leave.

139
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,664
I'm leaving. Bye.

140
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,825
But...

141
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,335
Give him his ice cream after
he finishes his porridge.

142
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,164
Even if he whines, okay?

143
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,774
And when he takes a bath, give him
three rubber duckies. He loves them.

144
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,514
- Hey, I said to leave!
- I'm leaving.

145
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:24,815
I'm leaving.

146
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,225
What is that?

147
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,664
Something that was...

148
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:47,705
the most precious thing to a
young man until a moment ago.

149
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,435
He doesn't have anything
like that anymore.

150
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:52,675
Just like me.

151
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,195
What? What is it?

152
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,764
Give me come.

153
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,975
What are you thinking about?

154
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,744
Just...

155
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:08,715
that something simple like
ice cream could make life...

156
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:09,815
this sweet.

157
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,394
What was your first love like?

158
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:20,825
What kind of a person was she?

159
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,264
Not something like she
was pretty like a lotus.

160
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,904
Her name was A Eum,
which meant "high sound".

161
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:29,305
A Eum.

162
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,575
That was her name.

163
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,675
She didn't have a tacky name
like people used to back then.

164
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,644
She must have been from
a wealthy family then.

165
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:40,945
How did you meet?

166
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:45,685
Unforgettably.

167
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,024
She treated me like a dog.

168
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,195
Do you want to die?

169
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:01,235
That's odd. Our pet dog
loves it when I do this.

170
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,774
What? How dare you?
Do you know who I am?

171
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:06,374
You're a fox, right? I'm A Eum.

172
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,945
Don't come back here again.

173
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,784
- Why not?
- This is a spirit's resting place.

174
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:15,215
Why?

175
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,455
Are you stupid?

176
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:18,855
Why?

177
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:49,284
They say the nine-tailed
fly across the sky.

178
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,685
You must be very powerful.

179
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,685
Now that you know, scram.

180
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,284
Unless you want
to be tiger food.

181
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,754
I want you to serve me.

182
00:17:58,695 --> 00:18:01,465
- What?
- I'll feed you rice every day.

183
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:02,865
I'll clothe you in silk too.

184
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,834
You'll live in luxury. Okay?

185
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,165
How cute.

186
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:11,235
She was too cute, so I gave
her a noogie and sent her away.

187
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,774
- And?
- And...

188
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,604
she went down, crying, and
came back within the day.

189
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,645
She's a persistent one.

190
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,044
Who won?

191
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,814
I let her win.

192
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:25,084
I was incredibly
magnanimous at the time.

193
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,814
Of course, I still am now.

194
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,284
I'm very magnanimous.

195
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:35,195
If you miss again,
I'm going to eat you.

196
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,034
Why can't you do
something this easy?

197
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:48,445
I told you. Shooting an arrow
is about riding the wind.

198
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,544
And I told you, I'm the
master of that wind.

199
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:54,514
- Let's do it again.
- You have no talent.

200
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:59,185
Human. Just go and do
embroidery or fly a kite, okay?

201
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,584
Don't you dare order me around.

202
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,994
You're testing my patience.

203
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:09,064
Look at this kid. Who are
you to have patience with me?

204
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,465
Throw it.

205
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,544
It wasn't that I couldn't
hit it, I didn't.

206
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,744
I didn't want you to get hurt.

207
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,145
Who are you to worry about me?

208
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,955
I like you.

209
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:38,254
You little human. Do you want
to be struck by lightning?

210
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,405
Isn't it time to tell me?

211
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,774
Why must it be an arrow?

212
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,385
Don't give me garbage
like, "Because it's cool."

213
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:07,685
I'm going to kill my father.

214
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,895
What? Your father?

215
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,594
Why? Who's your father?

216
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,264
He's the king of this nation.

217
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:37,715
Shoot.

218
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:40,885
As long as I'm around,
the wind belongs to you.

219
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:47,895
What an impressive first love.

220
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:52,594
It turned out she was the
king's seventh daughter.

221
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,764
An abandoned princess.

222
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:58,735
But why did she want
to kill her own father?

223
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,604
He was a king, and
yet not a king.

224
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,314
What?

225
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:09,044
Screams were heard
daily from the palace,

226
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,615
and hardship and suffering
were unending on the peninsula.

227
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:17,925
An evil being was in the palace
pretending to be the king.

228
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,024
An evil being?

229
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,764
Back in the day, people
called it the earth dragon.

230
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,594
Earth dragon?

231
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,465
A dragon buried in the ground...

232
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,165
Do you mean Imoogi?

233
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:34,205
My gosh. You are even
better looking in person.

234
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,475
You're very handsome.

235
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,145
Thank you.

236
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:38,945
No, thank you.

237
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,385
You sent a very generous
advance payment in cash.

238
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:45,014
- Does anyone know...
- Definitely not.

239
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,425
Anyway, whose child
is the baby...

240
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,225
that you're so secretive...

241
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:54,925
Actually, who cares
whose child the baby is?

242
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:57,465
All babies are angels.

243
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,764
The kid's room is the last
one on the second floor.

244
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,635
I see.

245
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:06,135
Then what should I do first?

246
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:07,475
As of now,

247
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:10,205
he only needs his meal.

248
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,774
Yes, of course.

249
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,274
Kid?

250
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,685
It's time for your meal.

251
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:01,094
Do you perhaps have
trouble hearing?

252
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:11,475
My gosh, your face...

253
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:14,945
Your wrist too.

254
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,645
Please don't tell me
that this is contagious.

255
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:20,314
I don't know.

256
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,344
How about you see for yourself?

257
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:06,195
What about the
rest of the story?

258
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:09,064
I never recollect
any more than that.

259
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,465
How did she die?

260
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,695
Your obsession will
bring about calamity.

261
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,665
To both you and
her who was reborn.

262
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,004
It's none of your business.

263
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:27,115
But it is. I know it is.

264
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:29,715
At times,

265
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:34,054
it's better to be in the dark.

266
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:39,294
So live your life as the
clueless person you have been.

267
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,925
I don't intend to live...

268
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,865
as the past version of
someone I do not know.

269
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,534
No, not yet!

270
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:58,844
It's fine. I've rested enough.

271
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,145
Let's get some fresh air.

272
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:15,494
It's hideous, isn't it?

273
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,735
I actually like it.

274
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,504
It suits you.

275
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:23,935
But I don't.

276
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:26,905
It's like I'm telling the
world that I was in a zoo.

277
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:30,104
- Says who?
- That veterinarian.

278
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:33,875
Unlike other men, he
doesn't push himself on me.

279
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,915
He looks at me with pity
and sadness in his eyes.

280
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,615
Then don't make him
look at you that way.

281
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:39,985
How?

282
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,284
How can one see without eyes?

283
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,165
Stop the car.

284
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,004
Let's raise the pot
from 5 dollars to 10.

285
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,435
- I'm in.
- It's mine anyway.

286
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:58,975
Here I go.

287
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,774
- No way.
- See that?

288
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,715
- Okay!
- What did I tell you?

289
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:08,385
Wait, it's not dead yet though.

290
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,715
- Hey!
- You're over the line.

291
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,915
- Take a step back.
- I'm not over the line.

292
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:18,925
Having fun, are we?

293
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:20,395
What the...

294
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,494
That's not how you
respond to your elders.

295
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,024
I asked if you were having fun.

296
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:25,665
Is he serious?

297
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:28,264
What's it to you anyway? Let go.

298
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:30,504
Let go of me!

299
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:35,504
How did such weaklings reach
the top of the food chain?

300
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,244
Don't just stand there!

301
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,084
- Hi, guys.
- And who might you be?

302
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,425
Did you just swear at me?

303
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,455
Die, die!

304
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:52,925
You're... You're bleeding.

305
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:55,895
Why you...

306
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,675
It stings, doesn't it?

307
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:23,824
You can't start
weeping just yet.

308
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:26,854
I have all the time
in the world, you see.

309
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,064
<font color="#00ff00">YEONGJU HANEUL FUNERAL HALL</font>

310
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,935
A morgue.

311
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:42,304
Nothing can top this as
a place for an outing.

312
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,475
It's quiet...

313
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:44,945
and has coffins.

314
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,744
Sorry about this, but
I can never let go...

315
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,344
of anything that bothers me.

316
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:53,615
Okay.

317
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:00,294
Come out.

318
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,465
Come on out.

319
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:15,604
- Hey, it's a fox.
- A fox.

320
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:17,715
Yes, I'm a fox.

321
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,115
Young sisters,
please come closer.

322
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:23,244
It's all right. Come this way.

323
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:26,455
That's it. Come closer.

324
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:28,324
Yes, that's close enough.

325
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:31,354
First of all, you
deserve this each.

326
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:34,665
Spirits shouldn't
cling onto humans.

327
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,564
Especially this human.

328
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:42,034
Ask away then.

329
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,445
What are your names?

330
00:28:50,574 --> 00:28:52,645
- I'm Min Seo.
- I'm Yeon Seo.

331
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:56,044
Min Seo and Yeon Seo, you
have something to say to me.

332
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:09,264
Are you the victims
of this accident?

335
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,415
Have you read this?

336
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:30,985

I'd rather not choose.

346

Why are you doing this to us?

347
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:23,905
This being a pastime of mine
is none of your business.

348
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,375
- Please don't kill us.
- Fine, you choose.

349
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:29,504
I made these myself.

00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,685
Just pick one.

354
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:51,048
I made these myself.

355
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,648

Congratulations.

363
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:26,447
What are you guys good at?

364
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,717
We're good at playing baseball.

365
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:31,318
We're baseball players.

366
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:33,388
I love baseball.

367
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,187
If you let us go,
we'll teach you well.

368
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,227
Yes, we will.

369
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,898
I know what you
guys are thinking,

370

but that's not it.

371
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:45,538
You won't be able to play baseball
for the rest of your lives.

372
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:49,108
In other words, you'll literally
be donating your talents.

373
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:54,947
Are you all right-handed?

374
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,578
He looks left-handed to me.

375
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:01,947
Gosh, whatever. Yu Ri, just
break both of their hands.

376
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,358
- Let's go.
- No, please.

377
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,917
- We're sorry!
- We won't do it again!

378
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,027
- We promise we won't do it again!
- Please don't do this to us!

379
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,328
- Please!
- No, don't!

380
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:11,628
We won't do it again!

381
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,098
Please...

382
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,237
Who... Who are you?

383
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:24,038
I was close with Min
Seo and Yeon Seo.

384
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,237
Oh, I see.

385
00:32:28,378 --> 00:32:32,177
I'm a truck driver, you see.

386
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:34,177
So I'm rarely ever home.

387
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:37,288
Yes, I know. I also know
that your brother...

388
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:40,088
took care of the kids
when you weren't home.

389
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,457
My brother happened to have
a job interview that day.

390
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:48,368
Do you know that
there are cherries...

391
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,027
inside the bag?

392
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:55,467
You must've been really
close with my kids.

393
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,578
These cherries were
quite expensive.

394
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:05,777
But they didn't
even touch them...

395
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:08,417
because they didn't like
anything I got for them.

396
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,467
Will you come with
me for a moment?

397
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,237
Help!

398
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,908
How do you think it'll
feel to get burned alive?

399
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:39,618
I heard this is about 1000°C.

400
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:42,187
Gosh, it's so hot. You're the reason
why I'm here feeling all this heat.

401
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:44,917
Please... Why are
you doing this to me?

402
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,217
You did something bad to
your nieces, didn't you?

403
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,257
No, I didn't. Who told you that?

404
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,328
- Just go inside.
- No, wait! Wait!

405
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,098
Wait! Yes, you're right.

406
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,538
I did it. It was me.
Please don't kill me.

407
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,098
You sexually molested
them, didn't you?

408
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,877
Yes, but I swear
I didn't mean to.

409
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,408
I was too drunk.

410
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:10,348
I didn't mean to kill them.

411
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,877
But the kids ran
to the balcony...

412
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:14,118
That's good enough.

413
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:22,927
You piece of trash!

414
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:24,328
The police are on
their way here.

415
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,268
I can't believe I had no idea.

416
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:32,498
I was such a fool.

417
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,908
Sir, the reason Min
Seo and Yeon Seo...

418
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,808
didn't eat any of
those cherries...

419
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:45,078
wasn't because they
didn't like you.

420
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,987
They just thought the
cherries were too precious.

421
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:55,188
They couldn't eat them because
they wanted to cherish...

422
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,558
what you got for them.

423
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,138
I'm so sorry.

424
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,308
He must like you.

425
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,507
I can't believe he's
wagging its tail...

426
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:52,777
even after what
he's been through.

427
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:55,388
He's so dumb and foolish.

428
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:56,947
I feel so bad for him.

429
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,257
Why don't we take him with us?

430
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:04,527
Oh, no.

431
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,467
Why did you come back?

432
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,228
I told you to run far away.

433
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,368
Does it hurt?

434
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,607
Oh, my gosh.

435
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,478
There was only one
thing I could do.

436
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:25,677
And that was to end
the pain myself.

437
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:28,918
No.

438
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,848
I can't do it.

439
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,188
I don't want to.

440
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:38,627
Yeon. Help.

441
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:41,098
Yeon!

442
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,507
Geomdoong.

443
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:55,708
Here.

444
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:58,078
I'm so excited.

445
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:01,688
Give him a lot of love, and
take good care of him, okay?

446
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:02,817
Okay, Yeon.

447
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,288
I'm so excited. You're
excited too, right?

448
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,788
Good boy.

449
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:10,987
Run faster.

450
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:15,368
I never should've
let him grow on me.

451
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,828
I never should've
given him a name.

452
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:20,397
I never should've slept
with him in my arms.

453
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:25,708
The day Yeon left the
forest, I lost everything...

454
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:27,808
that was precious to me.

455
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,518
Let's take him with us. Please.

456
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,118
No.

457
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:36,388
Why not?

458
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,458
I don't like dogs. Their
life span is too short.

459
00:37:49,797 --> 00:37:50,897
Let's go.

460
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,998
Goodbye.

461
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,038
Farewell.

462
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,808
Hey, go play somewhere else.

463
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:32,708
Go on.

464
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,808
Get going.

465
00:38:50,388 --> 00:38:51,828
Who were those kids?

466
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,668
This used to be a
grave for little kids.

467
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:57,067
They need to resolve
their resentment...

468
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,138
in order to leave
the Living Realm.

469
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:00,297
But it's too late.

470
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,507
I guess they died
a long time ago.

471
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,837
Back in the old days, they didn't
make gravestones for kids...

472
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,777
so that their parents
wouldn't be able to find them.

473
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:12,547
That's sad.

474
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:15,388
It's a sad custom that
was created in the past...

475
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,518
to prevent parents from dwelling
on their children's deaths.

476
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:20,618
Just like now,

477
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:23,357
parents were devastated to have
their children die so young.

478
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,837
You keep looking at me. Why?

479
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,348
No reason.

480
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,647
You just seem a little
different today.

481
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,788
You were the one who helped those
sisters resolve their resentment.

482
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,587
Thank you.

483
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,027
For what?

484
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:57,058
For everything.

485
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,737
My gosh.

486
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:16,607
Is it going to be
a meal or alcohol?

487
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:20,547
You told me humans treat people
to things when they're grateful.

488
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,158
I prefer alcohol.

489
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,598
Didn't you bring an
umbrella earlier?

490
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,668
I lost it.

491
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:40,697
- Are you stupid?
- Yes, I'm stupid.

492
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:42,538
No wonder.

493
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:45,507
You didn't sound very clever
when you interviewed me.

494
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:07,087
What? Why is a tree...

495
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:09,357
Let's go.

496
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:20,868
You always carry this
umbrella with you.

497
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,708
I hate getting wet.
It's bad for the fur.

498
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,208
It must be like how
dogs hate taking baths.

499
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,607
- Right. Hey.
- Yes.

500
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:33,647
I caught you because
of this umbrella.

501
00:42:34,078 --> 00:42:35,518
I let you catch me.

502
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:36,547
Whatever.

503
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,788
Like I can't lose
someone you if I tried?

504
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:45,627
Even if it pours like
this, I eat chicken.

505
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,828
Shin Ju likes chicken.

506
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:48,927
Hey.

507
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:51,837
Why were you out
during business hours?

508
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,638
I was bored out of my mind.

509
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,938
What... What brings
you here today?

510
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:00,138
Treat him.

511
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:20,958
How is he?

512
00:43:21,828 --> 00:43:23,168
His bone was crushed.

513
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,498
He's malnourished
and has skin disease.

514
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:27,498
The leash dug into his skin.

515
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,308
Where's my necklace?

516
00:43:33,038 --> 00:43:34,607
I need to talk to him.

517
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:37,478
Hurry.

518
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:39,947
Darn it.

519
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:50,058
What happened?

520
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:51,998
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

521
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:55,427
Yes. So she didn't do it?

522
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:57,197
Okay.

523
00:43:58,598 --> 00:43:59,837
He isn't a pet.

524
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,808
I stole him. I thought he'd
be better off being a pet.

525
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:05,877
- Yu Ri.
- What?

526
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,478
You did good.

527
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:11,677
I didn't like the necklace
thief, but I like the dog thief.

528
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:14,547
- Dog thief?
- I can't do it even if I wanted to.

529
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:16,317
I can't cross the line.

530
00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:20,688
I have no boundaries.

531
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:22,987
If you don't mind,
would you wait there?

532
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,507
It's okay.

533
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,277
It's okay.

534
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:59,197
How could you not
watch "Toy Story 3"?

535
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:04,797
When Woody stays behind and
watches Andy leave, and goes,

536
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:06,237
"So long, partner."

537
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,368
How could you not know that?

538
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,408
Isn't that a kids' movie?

539
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,208
It made adults
around the world cry.

540
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,777
I can't stand it when people
cry while watching a movie.

541
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:20,018
- Then which movie do you like?
- Me?

542
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,447
"Mad Max", "Avengers",

543
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:26,487
and every zombie movie
that ever existed.

544
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:30,757
I see. What's your
favorite type of music?

545
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:32,127
Anything by a boy
band, of course.

546
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:35,527
- What about classical music?
- I can't distinguish the singers.

547
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:36,768
Not singers, composers.

548
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:39,868
- Hiking.
- Not even if someone carries me.

549
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:43,168
Single malt whiskey.

550
00:45:43,268 --> 00:45:44,668
I'd rather drink cold medicine.

551
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:48,078
- Korean food or western food?
- Always Korean food.

552
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,147
Me too.

553
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:57,518
You don't have many
friends, right?

554
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,618
Me neither.

555
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,027
We're a good match.

556
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:07,098
"You Quiz on the Block"
or "Amazing Saturday"?

557
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,498
- "Amazing Saturday"!
- "Amazing Saturday"!

558
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,658
Yeon, what is your dream?

559
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:37,458
A future dream? At this age?

560
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:41,558
You know, like opening
a cafe after you retire.

561
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:44,168
Coffee tastes the best
when someone else makes it.

562
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,297
Like traveling around the world.

563
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:49,837
I'm a homebody, so I prefer
watching videos at home.

564
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,507
Saving up a million dollars.

565
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:52,578
A million dollars?

566
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:55,408
What's your account number?
I'll transfer it now.

567
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,618
Put that away.

568
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:01,877
- What? I can do smart banking.
- No.

569
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:18,098
If something that can never
come true can be a dream,

570
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:20,797
I want...

571
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,837
to become human.

572
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:31,848
Gosh. This nine-tailed
fox got spoiled by luxury.

573
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:35,177
If you want to know what
it's like to be human,

574
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:37,248
take the subway
during rush hour.

575
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:40,288
The Underworld is
closer than you think.

576
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,257
That's not all. You work
late, pull all-nighters,

577
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,828
listen to your boss nag,
which is all he ever does,

578
00:47:46,828 --> 00:47:49,027
and the stress about
ratings pummel down on you.

579
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:51,927
- Should I get rid of it?
- What?

580
00:47:51,927 --> 00:47:53,467
The TV station. You
said it torments you.

581
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:00,777
Whereas that is a
very novel approach,

582
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,547
let's drink first and
then think about it.

583
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:19,697
What about you?
What's your dream?

584
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:24,567
For me...

585
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:31,467
I'm fine if I live in a hut,

586
00:48:32,938 --> 00:48:36,578
but I wish my my mom and
dad will be with me...

587
00:48:36,578 --> 00:48:38,308
in my future.

588
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,458
Do you have a picture
of your parents?

589
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:56,797
Send me one.

590
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:12,647
Are you okay?

591
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,188
It's so dark.

592
00:49:17,147 --> 00:49:18,447
The street lamps are out.

593
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,587
- Can't you do things like that?
- What?

594
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:25,127
It would be so cool if you
could use your powers...

595
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:26,598
to fix them.

596
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:29,427
Submit a request with
the local authority.

597
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:31,828
What a useless nine-tailed fox.

598
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:33,897
Shin Ju closes the clinic
and comes running...

599
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:35,168
if a light blows out in my home.

600
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,908
He trained you all wrong.

601
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,007
Even a nine-tailed fox
is afraid of electricity.

602
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:47,248
- We're here.
- Yes, we are.

603
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:54,958
- Okay, bye now.
- Okay. Go on in.

604
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,587
Hey.

605
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,127
Good night.

606
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,168
You too. Good night.

607
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:47,538
It was Yeon...

608
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:49,607
back then too.

609
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:24,680
<font color="#00ff00">THE SITE OF GOBLINS CAN
BRING LUCK OR CALAMITY.</font>

610

<font color="#00ff00">NOODLES, SAMGYETANG</font>

611
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,120

612
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:38,600
"I can't reach a
babysitter I know."

613
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:42,907
Ms. Kim, have you
read this story?

614
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:45,247
I'm in the zone,
so don't bother me.

615
00:51:45,307 --> 00:51:47,646
- It'll only take a second.
- Leave me alone.

616
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:50,687
What's there to work on when you
copy and paste your own pieces?

617
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:52,387
I dare you to say that again.

618
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:56,026
I heard him loud and clear.
He said, "copy and paste."

619
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:57,157
Ms. Nam!

620
00:51:57,486 --> 00:51:59,227
Don't you know that the pen
is mightier than the sword?

621
00:51:59,457 --> 00:52:02,126
Today, you and I will both
take our last breaths.

622
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:07,937
Don't they get sick
and tired of that?

623
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,437
All right. So from now on,

624
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,907
you will build a stone tower
in the Underworld for Children.

625
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,916
When it's all built, a
goblin will appear...

626
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,446
and knock it all down,

627
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:26,216
but you must keep on
stacking the stones.

628
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:29,457
It's how you can
someday be reincarnated.

629
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:31,657
I don't want to go there.

630
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:34,626
My sister brushes her teeth
well and listens to our dad.

631
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:37,126
It may be called
as an Underworld,

632
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,296
but you'll be playing a
game of stacking blocks.

633
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:41,696
Just imagine how fun it'll be...

634
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,937
to play this game
with your sister?

635
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:46,776
I don't like stacking blocks.

636
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,477
My sister doesn't want to.

637
00:52:48,537 --> 00:52:51,776
I'm afraid you have
no choice though.

638
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,316
Can I watch cartoons
in the Underworld?

639
00:52:56,046 --> 00:52:57,316
You can't.

640
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,157
Then can I bring
this toy with me?

641
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:20,407
Objects from the Living
Realm aren't allowed.

642
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:23,207
I'm sorry, my dear.

643
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:27,646
Must you really be
this inconsiderate?

644
00:53:29,816 --> 00:53:32,887
Always such a
stickler for rules.

645
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:34,887
Why not ban the dead
from receiving money too?

646
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:36,586
My thoughts exactly.

647
00:53:37,057 --> 00:53:38,256
You, stay out of this.

648
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:40,896
Take the children
to the Underworld.

649
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:43,466
Got it. Kids, this way.

650
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:48,137
This way, please.

651
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:56,876
Kiddo, take good
care of your sister.

652
00:54:02,747 --> 00:54:04,117
What a sap.

653
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:05,446
This way, please.

654
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:11,256
Is the Underworld for
Children still in operation?

655
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,396
They must be punished for
breaking their parents' hearts.

656
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:16,396
Isn't it bad that their
lives ended early?

657
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:18,367
Must they be framed
as unfilial as well?

658
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,707
It's to quicken the process
of their reincarnation.

659
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:25,876
The Afterlife desperately
needs a face-lift too.

660
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,606
We need a younger King
Hades for starters.

661
00:54:30,006 --> 00:54:32,146
And a trip to the Underworld
of Tongue Ripping...

662
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:34,376
will snap some sense
into your head.

663
00:54:34,477 --> 00:54:37,847
Again with the torture. This
isn't the Middle Age anymore.

664
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:40,216
Ripping of tongues in an era...

665
00:54:40,216 --> 00:54:41,856
where we now brief
the dead via monitors?

666
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:47,196
Did you come by to pick a
fight with me this morning?

667
00:54:47,696 --> 00:54:48,756
Of course not.

668
00:54:50,427 --> 00:54:52,666
Here you go. It's
an iced Americano.

669
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,707
What do I need to do
to locate someone?

670
00:55:05,146 --> 00:55:06,617
Are you a PI on the side now?

671
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,446
Here.

672
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,756
I already checked the
list for their names.

673
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:18,356
They're not dead but haven't
been in contact for 20 years.

674
00:55:19,427 --> 00:55:21,626
- So?
- Let me use the Clairvoyance once.

675
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:24,767
Get that out of my face.

676
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,166
You know where they are, right?

677
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:28,367
- I don't.
- Don't be...

678
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:30,137
so stingy with your powers.

679
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:38,077
I meant that I can't see them.

680
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:43,117
- What?
- Those who I can't see...

681
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:45,787
They're not in the Afterlife
or the Living Realm.

682
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,626
I'd ask the ones who
initially took them.

683
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:53,727
Who took them?

684
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:55,896
And who may that be?

685
00:55:56,696 --> 00:55:59,637
Why does my list of assignments
keep getting longer?

686
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:04,807
I know that this is to
keep food on the table,

687
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:06,876
- but you take it too far.
- Sandwiches.

688
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:08,307
Guys, stop!

689
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:10,407
Here comes the president
of our network.

690
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:13,546
It's been a while.

691
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:16,916
Hello, sir.

692
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,117
Has the job been fun lately?

693
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:24,957
We work to earn paychecks,
not to have fun.

694
00:56:25,187 --> 00:56:26,396
You're as feisty as ever.

695
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:28,457
I heard your show had the
highest ratings last month.

696
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:30,696
That's right, so treat
us to a meal, sir.

697
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,666
Sure. I'll take your whole
team out for a meal soon.

698
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:37,137
Thank you, sir.

699
00:56:40,577 --> 00:56:41,677
Have a good day!

700
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:50,416
Pubyokru of the Taedong river.

701
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:57,387
I miss sailing.

702
00:56:58,557 --> 00:57:00,057
Who sails these days?

703
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:02,356
We now enjoy beer to the
crashing of the waves.

704
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:04,497
What nonsense are you spewing...

705
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:07,896
You're the old
totem, aren't you?

706
00:57:09,097 --> 00:57:10,236
I am,

707
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:12,736
but I prefer makgeolli
over beer now.

708
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:17,477
You should know better than
to show your back to me.

709
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:23,586
I heard you're the
totem of Yeou Gogae.

710
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:25,816
I'm looking for some people.

711
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:30,727
Have you seen them before?

712
00:57:33,696 --> 00:57:34,796
Yes or no?

713
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:36,097
I don't know.

714
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:39,267
I won't ask this again.

715
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:40,696
I really don't know!

716
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:48,437
You should've answered
me when I asked nicely...

717
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:50,046
instead of being
an intolerant brat.

718
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:53,017
So you're saying that someone
else knows about them?

719
00:57:55,216 --> 00:57:56,316
Who may that be?

720
00:57:58,086 --> 00:57:59,086
The g...

721
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:02,687
Louder, please.

722
00:58:02,756 --> 00:58:04,256
The governor!

723
00:58:05,187 --> 00:58:06,327
The governor?

724
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:13,896
For some reason,

725
00:58:13,966 --> 00:58:15,997
the president of the
network only addresses you.

726
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:17,707
I know.

727
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:20,836
What's your secret?

728
00:58:21,937 --> 00:58:24,677
For one, grow some balls.

729
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:27,646
That simple, is it?

730
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:30,387
You'll see once
you're at my rank.

731
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:33,716
Meeting the president from
an administrative position?

732
00:58:33,787 --> 00:58:35,657
You'll cower just like me.

733
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,086
It's not like you to
eat honey-garlic bread.

734
00:58:39,356 --> 00:58:41,026
When life takes you on
a roller coaster ride,

735
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:42,526
nothing grounds you like the
combination of sweet and salty.

736
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:44,026
Want some?

737
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:48,466
What flavor is that?

738
00:58:48,537 --> 00:58:50,506
Blueberry. But don't you dare.

739
00:58:50,836 --> 00:58:52,907
I'll let you once
you quit smoking.

740
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:55,207
You're such a jerk,
you know that?

741
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:00,977
Is this for real or am I
living in virtual reality?

742
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:05,687
Fit as a model and
just as handsome.

743
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,416
He also drives a sweet car.

744
00:59:13,856 --> 00:59:16,666
Meanwhile, what's in
front of me is a tragedy.

745
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:17,896
That's verbal
harassment, you know.

746
00:59:20,566 --> 00:59:21,597
Let's go.

747
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:24,236
Why are you here?

748
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:26,776
But...

749
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:28,276
What the...

750
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,477
What on earth?

751
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:34,247
- Where are we going?
- Just get in.

752
00:59:35,517 --> 00:59:36,617
Hurry.

753
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:46,126
What just happened?

754
00:59:47,256 --> 00:59:48,256
Beats me.

755
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:55,267
Where are we going?

756
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,207
To make your dream come true.

757
00:59:58,767 --> 00:59:59,807
No way.

758
00:59:59,977 --> 01:00:02,106
I even picked out some
songs you might like.

759
01:00:06,677 --> 01:00:09,687
<font color="#00ff00">"NEWTON" BY MONSTA X</font>

760
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:33,236
I'm looking for something.

761
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:36,077
What... What is it?

762
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:37,546
The eyebrows of a tiger.

763
01:00:38,106 --> 01:00:41,146
- That's just a legend.
- So am I.

764
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:43,546
But I'm right here
holding onto your collar.

765
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:46,017
I'm only going to ask you once.

766
01:00:46,216 --> 01:00:47,416
Did you see it or not?

767
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:49,356
No, I never saw it.

768
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:51,856
Really? Then you'll
just have to fall.

769
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:55,727
No, wait! Wait!

770
01:00:55,727 --> 01:00:59,196
Wait! Wait a minute!

771
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:05,466
Those darn foxes.

772
01:01:11,946 --> 01:01:14,517
Come and check this out!

773
01:01:24,157 --> 01:01:26,957
Consider yourself lucky!

774
01:01:26,957 --> 01:01:29,427
I'm doing this because I
never got to get married.

775
01:01:32,896 --> 01:01:35,066
Check it out! 1, 2...

776
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:37,966
Over here!

777
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,907
Wait here for a moment. I
need to take a look around.

778
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:48,876
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

I promise...

782
01:04:44,957 --> 01:04:46,727
to find you.

783
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:54,666
Where were you? I looked
