7
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,210
I told you to sit
tight, didn't I?

8
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,679
And so we meet again. How
long has it been exactly?

9
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,320
I didn't have to torture the
traitor to get my answers.

10
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,850
I wanted him to tell you
where and when to meet me.

11
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,789
I see the blade won't kill you.

12
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,929
Back then, I wore
the skin of a mortal.

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,170
Not this time though.

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,319
You have some cute tricks.

15
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,590
I wanted a chance to
measure our powers.

16
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,719
Sounds good to me.

17
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,670
Not bad.

18
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:32,400
You know nothing
about me, Lee Yeon.

19
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,969
I've lived far longer
than you think I have.

20
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,109
I existed long
before you were born.

21
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,879
The past is just a past.

22
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,650
And I'll outlive you.

23
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,680
Don't dream of an
unrealistic future.

24
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,519
In order to become a deity...

25
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,150
and finally be free of
this world's darkness,

26
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,890
you endured 1,000 years
beneath the black water.

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,590
This world would've been mine...

28
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,799
had I not been spotted by a human
while ascending as a dragon.

29
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,829
I feel bad for you. It's like...

30
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,530
getting kicked out of an exam...

31
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,939
because you got caught
with your phone.

32
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,199
How sad.

33
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,740
But that's how your fate
has been designed, Imoogi.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,310
You really should
get a proper name.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,909
You haven't changed at all.
You're still very arrogant.

36
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,849
You must think you have
the world at your feet.

37
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,349
I don't know about anything else,
but I do think that way about you.

38
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,219
You make me want
to trample on you.

39
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,389
Your brother, your woman,

40
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,759
and the life of her parents.

41
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,659
I have control over them all.

42
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:27,990
What do you have?

43
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,860
Let me make a reasonable offer.

44
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,069
Lee Yeon, if you give up your body,
I will let everyone else live.

45
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,009
What do I look like to you?

46
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,490
Seogyeong Traitor.

47
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,689
You're the one who
took my parents!

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,280
This is the carnation
I folded for them.

49
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,710
Flip it over.

50
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,189
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

51
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,259
Ji A, why won't you save us?

52
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,129
Are they alive?

53
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,030
- Where?
- Bring me the mountain spirit,

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,430
and I'll return
your parents to you.

55
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,800
- Tell me where they are!
- You saw them,

56
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,770
but failed to recognize them.

57
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,340
What do you mean by that?

58
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,439
You'll soon find out.

59
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,710
I won't let you
get away with this.

60
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,879
Call the cops then or
perhaps your boyfriend.

61
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,210
Any option will do,

62
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,280
but you won't ever see
your parents again.

63
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,780
Why? Why my parents?

64
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,490
Because I knew this
day would come.

65
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,560
You would do anything
to save your parents.

66
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,090
Just like how you saved your
father in your past life,

67
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,160
I hope that you'll once
again make a wise choice.

68
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,370
You'll let everyone go
if I give up my body?

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,310
Ji A, her parents,
and even Rang?

70
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,779
I'd like the entire package,

71
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,980
but just the heart will also do.

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,490
Are you serious?

73
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,389
I am.

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,089
So what will it be? Yes or no?

75
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,389
I...

76
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,170
I...

77
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,040
I don't want to.

78
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,480
- Why not?
- Because you seem like the type...

79
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,110
to go back on a deal.

80
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't do business
with those kinds.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,519
I'll personally free
them all from your grip.

82
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,750
Then enjoy...

83
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:12,860
trampling on those you treasure.

84
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,660
I know this isn't
appropriate to ask,

85
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,529
but why did you come back?

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,129
As if anyone would welcome...

87
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,000
the symbol of calamity,
plague, and war.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,199
If you're asking me my view of
the world, I don't have one.

89
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,199
All I want is one thing.

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,069
I want that woman.

91
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,079
The woman who was supposed to be
offered to me as a sacrifice...

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,709
but ended up saving
you and killing me.

93
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,350
I like her.

94
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,550
How dare you?

95
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,629
That's enough. I just
wanted to test your power.

96
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,000
For me, this is
just the beginning.

97
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,379
"I want to die. Now."

98
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,790
Do you feel it?

99
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,029
I knew it. You're
connected to him.

100
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,870
- What?
- You are his shell.

101
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,199
Why are you doing this?

102
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,670
You're also human.

103
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,339
I'm human, so I don't want to
die, and I have so many desires.

104
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,220
Was committing treason
not enough for you?

105
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,990
All I did was dream
of a new world...

106
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,220
after having been
born as a lowlife.

107
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,019
My kids, wife, and mother.

108
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,360
All I wanted to do was make
sure they could eat proper food.

109
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,160
But they called it treason
and threatened to behead me.

110
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,430
And that's when I met him.

111
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,670
I'm sure it wasn't for free.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,269
What did you have to give in return
for being able to stay alive?

113
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,339
My kids, wife, and mother.

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,910
I offered my family to Imoogi
and was able live in return.

115
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,610
You're crazy.

116
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,449
You must lose something in
order to gain something.

117
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,149
So you want me to sell Yeon out?

118
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,060
You want me to become
someone like you?

119
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,990
The choice is yours, Ji A.

120
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,560
Because of you, your parents
were gone for half their lives.

121
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,959
You can either see them
at their funeral or...

122
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,170
One drop of this
will be enough...

123
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,310
to make him fall
into a deep sleep.

124
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,939
Put Yeon to sleep.

125
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,980
Then you can get the life
you've always dreamed of.

126
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,559
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 11: GROUND CHERRIES</font>

127
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,200
I told you we should've
gotten a massage chair.

128
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,029
We'll only end up using
it as a clothing rack.

129
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,200
It's a waste of money.

130
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,169
I'm old now, so my body
isn't as healthy as...

131
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,370
Will you put some
strength into your hands?

132
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,279
Got it.

133
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,809
Bok Gil used to
give great massages.

134
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,649
He was also worried that you were
always working day and night,

135
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,490
so he'd gather the bark of hardy
rubber trees and Siberian ginseng...

136
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,220
and boil them for your joints...

137
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,860
I don't want to hear you
talking about that unfilial son.

138
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,039
Don't call my son unfilial.

139
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,509
Get out.

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,690
Why do you keep acting
like you're the only one...

141
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,059
who's heartbroken because
of our son's death?

142
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,019
I said get out!

143
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,360
It was because of you.

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
He wouldn't have
committed suicide...

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,629
if you hadn't killed his wife.

146
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,440
She was possessed with a
ghost that causes plagues.

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,710
I couldn't just sit back and
watch the entire nation...

148
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,210
suffer from a plague
because of her.

149
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,570
Exactly.

150
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,940
That's who you are.

151
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,009
You're neither Bok Gil's
mother nor my wife.

152
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,450
You're just the gatekeeper
of the Samdo River.

153
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,620
Meanwhile, I've been
trying so hard...

154
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,389
to understand you for so long, but
I guess that was foolish of me.

155
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,830
I don't even want to
look at you. Just leave!

It's Imoogi, isn't it?

159
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,039
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

160
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,000
It's his body I need.

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,639
Rather than thinking
about breaking the deal,

162
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,370
think of a way to
untangle the mess.

163
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,509
Imoogi, that scumbag.

164
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,379
What in the world has he done?

165
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,019
<font color="#00ff00">"UNPRECEDENTED MASS
SUICIDE, CITIZENS IN SHOCK"</font>

166
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,789
Can you believe this?

167
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,659
It's like a horror movie.

168
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,820
How could 132 people
in the same district...

169
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,159
all commit suicide
at the same time?

170
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,429
Do you think they were some
kind of a suicide group?

171
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,629
There wasn't a
single will found.

172
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,269
People who commit suicide
normally feel the urge...

173
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,669
to let people know
why they chose to die.

174
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,870
Or maybe it was a cult.

175
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,110
In the 1970s, a group of cult
believers in Jonestown...

176
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,370
committed mass suicide.

177
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,809
They all drank poison,

178
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,509
but this time, the causes
of death are all different.

179
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,250
This is so weird.

180
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,649
I'm back.

181
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,220
Hey, Terry. You're back.

182
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,490
Hey, wait. You were at
Geumran-gu. Hey, are you...

183
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,559
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

184
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,259
- Pardon?
- Didn't you see the news?

185
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,159
An hour ago, a group
of people died there.

186
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,629
- Really?
- Where is Ji A?

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,059
Didn't she come with you?

188
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,100
She left early saying
something urgent came up.

189
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,899
- Isn't she at the office?
- Really?

190
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,539
I didn't see her come back.

191
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,769
- Here's the footage I took.
- Thank you.

192
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,679
How was it today?

193
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,809
Did Ji A give you a hard time?

194
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,250
No, not at all.
She's really kind.

195
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,820
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A</font>

196
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,100
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A</font>

197
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,779
Bring me the mountain spirit,

198
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,350
and I'll return
your parents to you.

199
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,559
<font color="#00ff00">LEE YEON</font>

200
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,269
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

201
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,240
Come in.

202
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,009
My goodness.

203
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,179
This place is nice.

204
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,980
The living room is spacious,
but there aren't a lot of rooms.

205
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,889
I guess vets make
a lot of money.

206
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,129
Come this way.

207
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,700
Have a seat.

208
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,820
This is...

209
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,019
It's borscht, a
traditional Russian dish.

210
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,190
I know you probably didn't
grow up eating this.

211
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,190
But I thought you might miss
the smell of where you're from.

212
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,700
Don't you like it?

213
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,870
I sometimes miss the forest
where I was born and grew up in.

214
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,899
Right now, it's turned
into an apartment complex.

215
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,850
I know this smell.
I also like it.

216
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,830
On top of that, it's delicious.

217
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,429
Eat up.

218
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,649
Geomdoong?

220
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,049
Mister.

221
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,789
You brat. Get back here.

222
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,090
Don't annoy me. I will kill you.

223
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,820
Who's this?

224
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,559
My stepdad.

225
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,129
Come out. Get over here.

226
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,769
You choose.

227
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,429
You ask me for help,

228
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,740
I'll make sure you never
have to see him again.

229
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,309
Or I'll just go my way.

230
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,779
Hey you. Do you know him?

231
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,940
Why are you butting
into our family matter?

232
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,210
Quiet. I'm waiting
to hear his response.

233
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,649
What are you? Are you a cop?

234
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,250
So...

235
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,559
I...

236
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,289
Soo Ho. Answer wisely. Got it?

237
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,799
I have to go home.

238
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Okay.

239
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:53,559
Yu Ri, who has no
friends or family.

240
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,029
- What?
- I can't live without chicken,

241
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,500
but if you want to eat
Russian food at every meal,

242
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,599
I'm willing to change
my preferences.

243
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,339
What are you talking about?

244
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm saying I want to become...

245
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,140
your family and your friend.

246
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,380
Family... Well,

247
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,589
I have something
similar to that.

248
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,519
Your fake mom and dad
that Lee Rang gave you?

249
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,160
The department store owner?

250
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,619
Yes.

251
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm their dead daughter's
fill-in and just an empty shell,

252
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,329
but they can't live without me.

253
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,700
People say...

254
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:38,140
they'd like to throw away their
family if no one was watching.

255
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,299
Because they make life
hard on each other.

256
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,180
But then again, you
end up going back...

257
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,410
and taking them back.

258
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,509
Like Lee Yeon and Mr. Lee?

259
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,880
Right.

260
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,349
So...

261
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,589
Let the department owners
have their lives back,

262
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,019
and become a true
family with me and...

263
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,460
What are you guys doing here?

264
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,789
- Mr. Lee!
- Yeon?

265
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,130
What are you doing here?

266
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:06,500
I live here.

267
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,099
Hey. Have you seen Ji A?

268
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,869
She wasn't here. Why?

269
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,799
She isn't at the office
either. Where is she?

270
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,910
Anyway, keep doing whatever it
was with the necklace thief.

271
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,380
This is Yeon's house?

272
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,250
It's okay. His
house is my house.

273
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,450
Did you just laugh?

274
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,250
Sorry. Let's eat.

275
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,730
Mr. Lee?

276
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,200
What?

277
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,799
What are you doing here?

278
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,069
I felt like I could see
you if I hung around here.

279
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,039
You weren't answering your phone
all day long. Did something happen?

280
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,250
Yes.

281
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,680
Me too.

282
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,519
What happened?

283
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,019
But first...

284
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:36,950
Ta-da.

285
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,990
Open it.

286
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,269
Something that makes you happy
just by thinking about it.

287
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,079
You remembered.

288
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,109
Of course.

289
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,950
The smell of freshly cooked rice,
a complete set of world literature,

290
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,250
Dad's handmade
gimbap, new sneakers,

291
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:08,150
and me.

292
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,220
Buy one, get one free.

293
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,430
They say if you buy your girlfriend
sneakers, she'll run away.

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,029
Even if you run away, I want
you to wear new sneakers...

295
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,799
and only go on nice paths.

296
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,279
Why are you smiling so sadly?

297
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:36,750
Do you not like them?

298
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,750
I do.

299
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:43,190
I never knew that the
word "sneakers"...

300
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:46,589
had such a sweet meaning.

301
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,960
I like you.

302
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,069
So much that I wouldn't regret
exchanging my life for you.

303
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,079
Should we take a walk?

304
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,319
On a nice path.

305
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,349
Together.

306
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,690
What's this?

307
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,299
What else? A fresh human.

308
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:28,900
Who is he?

309
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,400
None of your concern.

310
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,299
Turn him into a ground
cherry for emergency food.

311
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,470
Much obliged.

312
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,819
He moved the ground
cherry pot somewhere else?

313
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,589
Do you want to watch?

314
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:54,059
Are you allowed to show me?

315
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,289
There's nothing to
hide between us.

316
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,700
It looks like an ordinary
seed, doesn't it?

317
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,930
It traps the body and soul,

318
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,940
so I call it a latch
for the body and soul.

319
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,609
Only Imoogi can create it.

320
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,150
What an evil soul.

321
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,019
He was in and out of prison...

322
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,589
Did you save a little kid?

323
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,430
I need at least one good deed...

324
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:05,259
to defend myself with when
I enter the Afterlife.

325
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,509
- Do you want more milk?
- Yes.

326
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,779
Eat up.

327
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,710
Stop eating already.
That milk is mine.

328
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,049
Why doesn't that lady go home?

329
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,779
You go home.

330
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,819
Or I'll eat your liver.

331
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,589
I don't have a home anymore.

332
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,730
Stop acting all pathetic.

333
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,359
Thousands of people in
Seoul don't have a home.

334
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,930
- Are you homeless too?
- Not me.

335
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,269
Stop fighting.

336
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:49,740
Soo Ho, right? Where's your mom?

337
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:52,210
My mom got beat up
every single day...

338
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,980
and ran away with
some guy I don't know.

339
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,880
That's why my stepdad
was so mad at me.

340
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,450
So you must have nowhere to go.

341
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,819
Oh, my gosh.

342
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,859
Mr. Lee, why are you
doing this to me?

343
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:05,960
Eat up.

344
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,069
What are you thinking about?

345
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,380
You know the story "The
Little Mermaid", right?

346
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,450
Andersen?

347
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,009
Yes.

348
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:34,480
Ever since I was a child,
I hated the ending.

349
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,089
She could've lived if she
had killed the prince.

350
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,619
So why did she
turn into sea foam?

351
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,900
What about you? What would
you do if it were you?

352
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,630
A long time ago, I thought I'd
definitely kill the prince...

353
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,529
and save myself.

354
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,099
But? Have you changed your mind?

355
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,170
Now that I've met the prince,

356
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,309
I grew to like him much
more than I imagined.

357
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,480
Although if the
prince were gone,

358
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,619
the fairy tale could
end with a happy ending.

359
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,660
If I were the little mermaid,

360
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,230
I'd kill the sea witch.

361
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,930
I'd rather not be her plaything.

362
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,140
I've been cursed.

363
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,809
I could have my parents
back if I sell you out.

364
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,259
I've heard their wish,

365
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,390
so tell me yours.

366
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:52,460
I want my voice back...

367
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,460
and find my prince.

368
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,430
All while not turning
into sea foam.

369
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,440
So come witch-hunting with me.

370
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,269
Are you sure you
can spare such time?

371
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:06,740
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

372
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,849
It may very well be
my last living day,

373
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:17,690
so what's it to you
whether or not...

374
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,190
I let it go to waste?

375
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,920
You'll just throw
your life away?

376
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,430
For the brother you loathe?

377
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,630
Imoogi met with Lee Yeon today.

378
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,940
He let your brother know
of our three hostages.

379
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,440
Ji A, her parents, and you.

380
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:41,210
Where do you think
he is right now?

381
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,250
Has he even called
you in concern?

382
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,220
Liar.

383
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,190
You've been
abandoned once again.

384
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:59,200
You're right. I did abandon you.

385
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,559
I'm sorry...

386
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,230
for saving you after your
human mother abandoned you.

387
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,799
Yeon...

388
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,769
I never abandoned you.

389
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,279
He said he never
once abandoned me.

390
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,190
You of all people
know that it's a lie.

391
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,819
- Hey, kid!
- Yeon?

392
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,900
He saved me from the
Forest of the Starved.

393
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,759
He had to in order to save Ji A.

394
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,329
You're nothing but disposable.

395
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,569
Shut it!

396
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,940
Lee Yeon will do
anything for Ji A...

397
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,039
even if that
involves killing you.

398
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,680
If you go after her,

399
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,980
I'll kill you for
real this time.

400
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,789
Will you give up your life...

401
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,819
for a brother who only
cares for his girl?

402
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:23,509
Yes, Mr. Lee.

403
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,089
What? Shin Ju?

404
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:31,759
He wants to talk to you.

405
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,859
This is Shin Ju.

406
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,259
You know, right? Where's Yeon?

407
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:39,029
He went to see Ms. Nam.

408
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,329
So where?

409
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,630
I'll call you back
with an answer.

410
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:53,910
It's 132 people.

411
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,579
The number of dead people
who aren't on the list is...

412
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,309
There will be more.

413
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,819
- What?
- He is chaos itself.

414
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,349
We're only getting started.

415
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:05,089
Then let's bring him in. Tell
me how, and I'll do it myself.

416
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,789
It's beyond your capacity.

417
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,859
In order to bring him in,

418
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,430
you'll have to do what
you hate with passion.

419
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,599
And what may that be?

420
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,099
Hey, Yeon. You're here.

421
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,019
What? My gosh, you...

422
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,789
Hello, sir and ma'am.

423
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,619
I'm Nam Ji A.

424
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:57,205
Well, Yeon told us
a lot about you.

425
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:58,505
It's nice to meet you.

426
00:30:58,634 --> 00:30:59,874
You!

427
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:04,344
How dare you bring a
living person here?

428
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:06,074
I know she's a living person,

429
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,384
but she's also at the center of
the argument you were having.

430
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:18,554
You have stepped in here
far too early. Go back.

431
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,195
I'm well aware that you highly
value rules and principles.

432
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:23,725
I came here knowing
the risks because...

433
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,965
Do I look like your
fairy godmother?

434
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,965
- What the...
- Hold it.

435
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:31,235
Or maybe...

436
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:33,975
you'd like to know when you die.

437
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,475
No. I stay away from fortune
tellers since I hate spoilers...

438
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,844
even about my own life.

439
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:40,945
- Then what?
- I lost my parents at nine.

440
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:43,114
This isn't a place
for your sob story.

441
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,985
I hear that I possess something
that belongs to Imoogi.

442
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:48,015
That's also the fate
you were handed.

443
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:52,094
I plan to defy that fate
until my last breath.

444
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,495
It is why I came here knowing
that it wasn't a place...

445
00:31:58,495 --> 00:31:59,765
for living people.

446
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:03,765
- She's just like you.
- Yes, we were made for each other.

447
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:08,475
I admire you not being
intimidated by me.

448
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:10,074
So tell me why you're here.

449
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:13,915
Let me borrow Clairvoyance.

450
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:16,044
I wish to know where
my parents are.

451
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:19,485
- What?
- It won't be for free.

452
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:21,584
As if you have anything
to offer in return.

453
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:24,425
I'd let you overcharge
me knowingly,

454
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,725
but I don't have much to spare.

455
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,225
Then with what will
you strike a deal?

456
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,265
We'll bring you Imoogi.

457
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:36,035
Yeon and I.

458
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:52,955
Gosh, I made it out alive.

459
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,324
Didn't you see me
trembling in there?

460
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,455
It hardly seemed like the case.

461
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,824
I thought that past lives
and the Afterlife...

462
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:04,725
only existed in comic books,

463
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:06,134
but they're real.

464
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:09,035
Sinners only have
better lives...

465
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:10,935
until they take
their last breaths.

466
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,304
Do you help the dead cross
Samdo River from here?

467
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:18,374
I give a presentation about
what to expect in the Afterlife,

468
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:20,915
catch those who refuse
to cross the river,

469
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:23,215
and keep my wife happy.

470
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:26,114
I'm glad...

471
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,884
that someone as considerate
as you is the first person...

472
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,755
people meet after passing.

473
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:36,765
You grew up well even though...

474
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,894
you lost your parents
at a young age.

475
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,195
They'll be incredibly
proud of you.

476
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:44,965
Will I ever get
to see them again?

477
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:49,945
Let's trust Yeon and
believe that he'll deliver.

478
00:33:57,614 --> 00:33:58,884
This isn't like you, Granny.

479
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:00,685
Why do you say that?

480
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:03,955
Because you would've
turned Imoogi into stone...

481
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:06,955
way before he became a problem.

482
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,565
I remember how you turned...

483
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:11,424
the northern mountain
spirit into one...

484
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,765
just for getting
on your wrong side.

485
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:13,964
So why...

486
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:17,804
is Imoogi an exception?

487
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,304
Because I don't want
to see you go crazy.

488
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:26,415
- What do you mean by that?
- A piece of him lies with her.

489
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:27,815
The Imoogi.

490
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:34,984
Is there a way...

491
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:38,024
to free her from it?

492
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:39,424
No.

493
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,024
Either she dies...

494
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,795
or the Imoogi leaves
her voluntarily.

495
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:47,694
I don't believe that. How can
a piece of it be with her?

496
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:50,035
You must've heard
something about it.

497
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:55,645
Despite your best efforts,
Imoogi was awoken.

498
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,545
The girl will be sacrificed,

499
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:03,245
and the rest of your life
will be nothing but painful.

500
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:05,815
That...

501
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,484
is your fate.

502
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:14,895
Now I get why you didn't
want me to find her.

503
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:20,734
From the start, you
said we shouldn't meet.

504
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,205
You didn't want me
to get hurt again.

505
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:27,234
You didn't want me dragged
into that fate again.

506
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,245
Thanks, Granny.

507
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:39,955
But still, I choose her.

508
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:45,185
My only purpose in life
was to meet her again.

509
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,065
It looks like...

510
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:51,565
you'll always end up
making the same choice.

511
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,565
The ground cherries.

512
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:04,904
That's where her parents are.

513
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,085
Let's go.

514
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:17,955
- We'll be off now.
- Oh, okay.

515
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:20,395
If anything happens,

516
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:23,194
come here and repeat
my name three times.

517
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:24,725
I don't know if you'll win or
lose the fight against fate,

518
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,234
but I still want
to bet on you guys.

519
00:36:27,995 --> 00:36:29,065
Thank you.

520
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:32,035
You should go now.

521
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:43,585
Did you find out?

522
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,114
The ground cherries.

523
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:46,355
"Ground cherries"?

524
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,855
I've never seen ground
cherries in Seoul before.

525
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:51,185
Are these ground cherries?

526
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:53,194
That's where my mom and dad are?

527
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:55,665
How?

528
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,265
That plant can trap the body
and soul of a living person.

529
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,864
And he used that to lengthen
the lives of his followers.

530
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:03,964
Let's go. It was
in the living room.

531
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,234
It was in the center
of the living room.

532
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:06,574
He probably moved
it somewhere else.

533
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:07,904
It wasn't there
when I last went.

534
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,895
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

535
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,424
You drove a wedge
between the two brothers.

536
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:01,594
Do you think Rang
will fall for it?

537
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:02,694
Yes, he will.

538
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,795
Rang has a deep-rooted
obsession for his brother.

539
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:07,995
It's a lot more
twisted than you think.

540
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:11,035
You think he can kill
him because he loves him?

541
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:12,875
Leave this to me.

542
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:15,274
I'll bring you Yeon's heart.

543
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,705
Don't look down on him.

544
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,415
The reason I got defeated
by him long ago...

545
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,375
was because I
underestimated him.

546
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,915
That's why I set up three traps.

547
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,585
We just need one of
them to fall for it.

548
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,754
Once this is over,
I'll go into politics.

549
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,194
I'm sick of pretending to be the
CEO of a broadcasting company.

550
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,895
- And I deserve a reward.
- Whatever you want.

551
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,335
You little monster.

552
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,875
Where do you think
he is right now?

553
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,745
Has he even called
you in concern?

554
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:50,645
You've been
abandoned once again.

555
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:52,344
Will you give up your life...

556
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:55,114
for a brother who only
cares for his girl?

557
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,625
- Yeon.
- Were there ground cherries...

558
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,895
at Imoogi's house?

559
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:09,924
Ji A's parents are
trapped inside there.

560
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:11,194
Do you know anything about that?

561
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:16,335
Is that all you
have to say to me?

562
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:18,605
Did you see the cherries or not?

563
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,904
I did.

564
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:23,045
Where did he hide the cherries?

565
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:24,904
I don't know that much.

566
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:27,714
- Bye.
- I can find out.

567
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:30,344
The CEO values it as
much as his own life.

568
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,085
- Really?
- Let's meet tomorrow.

569
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:34,654
Let's talk about it then.

570
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:56,804
Rang told me he'll look into it.
I'm going to meet him tomorrow.

571
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:59,274
Where? What time?
Should I go with you?

572
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:02,685
Leave it to me.

573
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,785
I need you to do the thing
that only you can do.

574
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:11,824
What are you guys doing here?

575
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,355
We got too worried about her...

576
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:15,054
after knowing her boyfriend
is a nine-tailed fox.

577
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:17,194
- Ji A.
- What?

578
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:18,995
How did you know where I live?

579
00:40:18,995 --> 00:40:21,364
Director Nam once did a
background check on you.

580
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:23,004
Why did you come
all the way here?

581
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,234
We came to see if you're safe.

582
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:28,205
I won't ever approve
of a nine-tailed fox...

583
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,975
Actually, I take that back.
How big is this living room?

584
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,685
I didn't think it was right
to visit empty-handedly.

585
00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:40,754
- What is it?
- It's just a snack.

586
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:43,785
Mealworms?

587
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,654
I asked a friend who
directs an animal show,

588
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:47,194
and he told me foxes love it.

589
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:50,395
I had trouble choosing between
mealworms and crickets.

590
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:51,665
You can go ahead and enjoy it.

591
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:56,265
Did you guys eat dinner?

592
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:58,304
- No.
- I'll order.

593
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:46,484
Only the fox's death can
break a deal made by a fox.

594
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:56,725
<font color="#00ff00">GOBOON'S TRIPE RESTAURANT</font>

595
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:02,404
They wrap it in a bundle?

596
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,265
Let me eat with them first.

597
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:15,214
The CEO was the accomplice
of the mummy case?

598
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:18,545
I asked him about the nail I
found, and he admitted everything.

599
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:19,785
Why don't you call the cops?

600
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:21,015
And say what?

601
00:42:21,214 --> 00:42:24,625
That our CEO is from Goryeo?

602
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,694
And that he's a follower of Imoogi
and goes around killing people?

603
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:28,995
You think they'll believe that?

604
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:30,295
You're right.

605
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:32,395
Then why not let Detective
Baek put on those glasses...

606
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:34,165
that show you
people's past lives?

607
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:35,964
Once he sees
people's past lives,

608
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:37,464
he might believe that
there's a guy from Goryeo.

609
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,634
Are you sure he graduated from
the best university in Korea?

610
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:43,245
He's a nice guy.

611
00:42:44,174 --> 00:42:45,745
Why aren't you eating anything?

612
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:48,114
You didn't eat the mealworms,
and you're not eating any tripe.

613
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,415
Do you eat people's livers?

614
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,714
You're making me
crave it a little.

615
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:03,464
It's pretty good.

616
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:06,665
I know this is rude,
but do you have a tail?

617
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:07,935
Why would you ask if
you know it's rude?

618
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:10,535
I still can't believe that
you're a nine-tailed fox.

619
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:12,165
Yes, he has one. I saw it.

620
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:13,975
Unbelievable. Then do you also
put a leaf on your forehead...

621
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:15,475
and transform yourself?

622
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:16,645
That's a raccoon.

623
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:19,074
And I do know how to transform, but
I don't because it's not classy.

624
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,645
Show us! Show us!

625
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:22,984
You punk.

626
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,785
- My gosh, just eat.
- Just eat the food.

627
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:44,964
I'll do it.

628
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:50,745
What made you change your mind?

629
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:53,015
I want to live.

630
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:58,984
Do you really think you can
take out your brother's heart?

631
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:02,185
You can take out his heart.

632
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:04,785
I'll lure him to you.

633
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:07,725
You have such a tender heart.

634
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:12,194
Take this.

635
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:18,065
And lure Yeon to the
location I tell you to.

636
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:21,234
From now on, we'll
be moving together.

637
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:24,004
You can sleep here tonight.

638
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,984
He's so fit to work at
a broadcasting company.

639
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:14,654
- You should keep working here.
- You're too kind.

640
00:45:15,024 --> 00:45:16,565
Did you buy everything
this morning?

641
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:17,565
Yes.

642
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,194
- Eat up.
- It looks good. Let's eat.

643
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:22,065
When did you get so close?

644
00:45:22,134 --> 00:45:24,504
Hey. He's a real piece of work.

645
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:27,734
He knows history, literature,
arts, religion, everything.

646
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:29,105
He's a walking encyclopedia.

647
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:30,645
He was useful on the field too.

648
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,274
Remember the foreign language
papers on past lives?

649
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,944
He translated the English,
French, and Chinese papers...

650
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,085
all last night.

651
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:39,415
What's your secret?

652
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:42,315
I never left home when I was
young because of my health.

653
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:45,054
I was alone other than
for my babysitter.

654
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,094
So all I did was read.

655
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:00,674
Good morning. So this
was where you all were.

656
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:03,045
Nice. Who picked up sandwiches?

657
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:06,545
- It's mine.
- Just one. Don't be cheap.

658
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:11,815
Urban Legends team, we
have a team dinner tonight.

659
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:13,455
- I'm out.
- Me too.

660
00:46:13,455 --> 00:46:15,785
No, no, no. No
investigations, no editing,

661
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:18,154
no excuses will
work today. Why not?

662
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:19,995
Because it's Terry's
welcome dinner.

663
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:39,844
Hey.

664
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:43,714
What are you doing here?

665
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:47,455
Making coffee.

666
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:50,585
What's with these flowers
that don't suit you at all?

667
00:46:51,554 --> 00:46:53,355
So that you can enjoy the
scent of our old home.

668
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,594
Pick one that you like.
Women love this stuff.

669
00:46:57,964 --> 00:46:59,535
That was thoughtful of you.

670
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:45,344
So? Where are the ground
cherries? Did you find out?

671
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:46,574
What's the rush?

672
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:48,045
I don't have time to chit chat.

673
00:47:50,545 --> 00:47:52,815
- What?
- I don't have time either.

674
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:56,225
But still, listen to
what I have to say.

675
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:00,024
What is it?

676
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:05,625
What am I to you?

677
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:11,504
Where did things
get twisted again?

678
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:14,174
I've done all I could.

679
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,004
What's the problem this time?

680
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:17,304
Answer me.

681
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:20,344
What am I to you?

682
00:48:23,344 --> 00:48:24,484
You're family.

683
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:27,915
Sickening family that thinks
just because we had the same dad,

684
00:48:27,915 --> 00:48:31,484
you had the right to do all
sorts of wicked things to me.

685
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:36,094
Don't think I'll feed
you flowery words...

686
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:38,565
just because you
surrounded me with flowers.

687
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:42,234
I'm sick of your
whining at your age!

688
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:47,475
You're so mean to me...

689
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:51,375
when you're endlessly
magnanimous to her.

690
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,015
Yes. Because she's
much tougher than you.

691
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:57,085
She doesn't cling onto her
family tragedy like a loser...

692
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:58,745
and whine like somebody.

693
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:01,685
Isn't it odd?

694
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,094
You were never once
a nice brother,

695
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:10,265
but shone in my
eyes as if you were.

696
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:13,565
You seemed perfect.

697
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:15,995
I wanted...

698
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:18,964
to become like you.

699
00:49:26,774 --> 00:49:27,875
Drink it.

700
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:30,944
What if you spiked it?

701
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:37,085
Calm down. I'm just kidding.

702
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:02,884
So? Where are the
ground cherries?

703
00:50:03,185 --> 00:50:05,085
Wait. We'll find them soon.

704
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:08,654
Don't you dare try
anything funny.

705
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,924
After you saved me from
the Forest of the Starved,

706
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:12,995
I thought...

707
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:20,165
I should die for you someday...

708
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:22,464
in order to save you.

709
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:28,404
But you know, I
realized I couldn't.

710
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:30,245
I want to live.

711
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:34,015
That's why...

712
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:38,145
I need you to die, big brother.

713
00:50:51,895 --> 00:50:53,065
Do you want to fight?

714
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:56,864
I can't beat you if we
fight fair and square.

715
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:02,674
The coffee.

716
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:19,524
If you cared for me even a fraction
of how much you worry about her,

717
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:22,654
I wouldn't have done this.

718
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:25,364
I could never.

719
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:32,265
You idiot.

720
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:29,165
We got Lee Yeon.

721
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:34,205
Wait until I get there.

722
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,734
Don't call me on
this phone again.

723
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:45,884
Darn it. Does he think I'm
his lackey or something?

724
00:52:57,165 --> 00:52:59,634
Hey. Here. Come here.

725
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:02,594
Sit down. Sit. Okay.

726
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:05,734
Okay, then. Fill your
glasses everyone.

727
00:53:05,904 --> 00:53:07,674
I'll fill yours, Terry.

728
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:10,275
Okay. Here you go.

729
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:12,404
- Thank you.
- I'll pour my own.

730
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:16,484
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

731
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,415
- Thank you.
- Drink up.

732
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:24,025
Gosh. I wish I had
a son like him.

733
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:28,295
He's handsome,
smart... He's so...

734
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:30,694
My gosh. He's so
fit. He's solid.

735
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:35,534
He's totally... Sure.
You're a good kid.

736
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:38,364
I'm starting to
respect Mr. Choi now.

737
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:40,734
How is he so unchanging?

738
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:50,415
I'm going to get some air.

739
00:53:54,754 --> 00:53:55,984
Terry, where are you going?

740
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,094
I need to meet
someone for a bit.

741
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:07,395
I'll be right back.

742
00:54:07,464 --> 00:54:09,364
Where did you
learn such manners?

743
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,864
- Sorry?
- Who leaves a dinner...

744
00:54:11,864 --> 00:54:13,105
without saying anything?

745
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:14,435
Especially the guest of honor.

746
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,844
- I'm sorry.
- I have a lot of questions for you.

747
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:23,114
Like what, for instance?

748
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:27,784
What's your favorite book?

749
00:54:28,815 --> 00:54:30,784
- "A Lover's Discourse: Fragments".
- By Roland Barthes?

750
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:31,924
Have you read it?

751
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:33,355
I got baited by the title.

752
00:54:33,824 --> 00:54:35,725
I thought it'd
teach me about love,

753
00:54:35,895 --> 00:54:38,324
but to understand
his language of love,

754
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:41,134
one needs at least
a master's degree.

755
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:43,705
He wrote many beautiful phrases.

756
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:47,335
"He praises her perfection..."

757
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:50,504
"and praises himself..."

758
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:52,475
"for choosing pure perfection."

759
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:57,284
Meanwhile, I praise cocktails.

760
00:54:57,915 --> 00:54:59,085
Come on.

761
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:15,895
I have five minutes
left. End our deal.

762
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:20,875
Our deal ends when I
have Lee Yeon's heart.

763
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:23,605
I brought him to
you as promised.

764
00:55:24,245 --> 00:55:26,475
Now announce the
end of our deal.

765
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:28,875
Can't you see I'm
waiting for Imoogi?

766
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,444
Being rude, are we?

767
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:31,915
I bet it drives you crazy.

768
00:55:33,085 --> 00:55:35,554
You can't kill the one
who you owe a favor.

769
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:43,565
Once a slave, always a slave.

770
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:46,324
You can't do anything without
your master's approval.

771
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:47,864
Watch what you say.

772
00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:50,964
You're still bound to
me by the favor you owe.

773
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:54,034
You serve a creature that
sucked the blood of your family.

774
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:56,234
Shut it.

775
00:55:56,234 --> 00:55:57,304
How did it feel...

776
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,975
to watch your parents,
wife, and children die?

777
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:01,714
Did you cry?

778
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,214
- I told you to shut it.
- Then say it!

779
00:56:04,685 --> 00:56:06,344
Say that our deal is over.

780
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,154
Fine. I'll end our deal...

781
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:11,685
in my own way.

782
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,364
You've lost your mind.

783
00:56:26,835 --> 00:56:28,674
No can do, I'm afraid.

784
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:31,645
I may be a worthless
piece of trash,

785
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:35,375
but I can't sacrifice my
family to get what I want.

786
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:39,245
You... Then you'll die.

787
00:56:40,415 --> 00:56:41,515
I won't.

788
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:43,824
Foxes die when they
go back on a deal.

789
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,484
And foxes...

790
00:56:48,025 --> 00:56:49,554
can change their appearances.

791
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:52,864
Although, I find it distasteful.

792
00:56:59,234 --> 00:57:01,504
You and your desire
to seem graceful.

793
00:57:01,804 --> 00:57:04,275
I thought you said
you'd only take a sip?

794
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:07,275
What's going on?

795
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:08,475
Since when...

796
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:12,944
Since your place last night.

797
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,324
What are you...

798
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:27,765
doing here?

799
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:35,875
I'm sorry.

800
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:39,174
I only thought you were
one of the hostages.

801
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,515
I didn't think
he'd kill everyone.

802
00:57:51,525 --> 00:57:53,924
So how about you keep
living by my side?

803
00:57:59,265 --> 00:58:00,565
No matter what I do,

804
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,605
I can't be free of my deal.

805
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:05,265
There's a way.

806
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,375
How?

807
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,574
Swap places with me...

808
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:16,315
and bring me to him
just like he wants.

809
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:19,384
I'll do it.

810
00:58:20,384 --> 00:58:21,515
Take this.

811
00:58:22,654 --> 00:58:24,284
You can sleep here tonight.

812
00:58:43,745 --> 00:58:47,174
Darn you. How dare you!

813
00:58:57,725 --> 00:59:00,254
You. Kill Lee Yeon right now...

814
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:03,594
Stop harassing my brother...

815
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:05,964
or I'll have to snap your neck.

816
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:10,265
So, the choice is yours.

817
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:14,034
Kill Rang and have your
life ended by me. Or...

818
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:16,904
change his deal.

819
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:26,185
Save me and our
deal will be over.

820
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:49,975
The ground cherries...
Take me to where they are.

821
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:18,004
- Here.
- We drink to get drunk.

822
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:20,004
- Darn it.
- But you're wasted, sir.

823
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:21,574
- But...
- Please drive safely. Bye!

824
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:23,205
I'll get going then!

825
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:28,674
Take my car instead. I called
for a designated driver.

826
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,344
- It's fine.
- But I'm not.

827
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:39,725
Sorry about that.
You can get going.

828
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:55,475
Ms. Nam.

829
01:00:56,504 --> 01:00:58,705
- Yes?
- Are you seeing someone?

830
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:01,275
Yes, I am.

831
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:03,275
What's your boyfriend like?

832
01:01:05,344 --> 01:01:06,915
Like someone from a fairy tale.

833
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:09,085
Break up with him.

834
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:13,185
- What?
- Fairy tales for grown-ups...

835
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:16,625
tend to have savage endings.

836
01:01:28,475 --> 01:01:30,275
So long. Thank you
for everything.

837
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:34,645
What a blabbermouth.

838
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,125
I no longer am bound.

839
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,424
Nice acting, by the way.

840
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:55,234
You were good enough
to be an actor.

841
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:56,935
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

842
01:02:23,154 --> 01:02:24,225
Terry.

843
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:28,495
Don't pretend with
the romantic feelings.

844
01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:31,464
Because to me,

845
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:38,944
you're nothing...

846
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:41,745
but the thing that took
my parents from me.

847
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:44,944
I see you've known all along.

848
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:52,424
Is that why you've
been keeping me here?

849
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:56,495
I need you to do the thing
that only you can do.

850
01:02:57,464 --> 01:02:58,895
What only I can do?

851
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,694
While I search for
the ground cherries,

852
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,364
keep Imoogi occupied.

853
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:05,004
Imoogi?

854
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:07,534
Where is he?

855
01:03:07,904 --> 01:03:08,904
Someplace...

856
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,475
much closer to you
than you think.

857
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,344
Much closer to me?

858
01:03:17,185 --> 01:03:18,484
No way...

859
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:26,254
You seem unprotected...

860
01:03:26,254 --> 01:03:27,795
for someone who knows
my true identity.

861
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:31,795
Yeon told me...

862
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:34,634
that you can't kill me.

863
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:38,665
He's right.

864
01:03:43,804 --> 01:03:45,674
I'm quite fond of you.

865
01:05:36,254 --> 01:05:37,384
Mom.

866
01:05:41,254 --> 01:05:42,395
Dad.

867
01:06:27,034 --> 01:06:30,134
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

868
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:32,105
<i>You probably wanted to warn me.</i>

869
01:06:32,745 --> 01:06:34,645
<i>I'll save your life
no matter what.</i>

870
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:36,645
<i>You're going to attack
Imoogi directly?</i>

871
01:06:36,645 --> 01:06:38,344
<i>I'm going to find his weakness.</i>

872
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,955
<i>I'll kill those who
are precious to you.</i>

873
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,554
<i>A bigger disaster is on its way.</i>

874
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:44,455
<i>Don't touch them.</i>

875
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:46,984
<i>Look carefully. I am you.</i>

876
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,125
<i>Where is Ji A? Where is she?</i>

877
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:51,025
<i>A plague will hit this world.</i>

878
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,395
<i>No one will be happy.</i>

879
01:06:53,395 --> 01:06:54,795
<i>Why does it have
to be Ji A? Why?</i>

880
01:06:54,964 --> 01:06:57,435
<i>Turn everything back
to where it belongs.</i>
