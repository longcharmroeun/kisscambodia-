1
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,050
I told you to sit
tight, didn't I?

2
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,519
And so we meet again. How
long has it been exactly?

3
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,160
I didn't have to torture the
traitor to get my answers.

4
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,690
I wanted him to tell you
where and when to meet me.

5
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,629
I see the blade won't kill you.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,769
Back then, I wore
the skin of a mortal.

7
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,010
Not this time though.

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,159
You have some cute tricks.

9
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,430
I wanted a chance to
measure our powers.

10
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,559
Sounds good to me.

11
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,510
Not bad.

12
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,240
You know nothing
about me, Lee Yeon.

13
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,809
I've lived far longer
than you think I have.

14
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,949
I existed long
before you were born.

15
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,719
The past is just a past.

16
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,490
And I'll outlive you.

17
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,520
Don't dream of an
unrealistic future.

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,359
In order to become a deity...

19
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,990
and finally be free of
this world's darkness,

20
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,730
you endured 1,000 years
beneath the black water.

21
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,430
This world would've been mine...

22
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,639
had I not been spotted by a human
while ascending as a dragon.

23
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,669
I feel bad for you. It's like...

24
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,370
getting kicked out of an exam...

25
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,779
because you got caught
with your phone.

26
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,039
How sad.

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,580
But that's how your fate
has been designed, Imoogi.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,150
You really should
get a proper name.

29
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,749
You haven't changed at all.
You're still very arrogant.

30
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,689
You must think you have
the world at your feet.

31
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,189
I don't know about anything else,
but I do think that way about you.

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,059
You make me want
to trample on you.

33
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,229
Your brother, your woman,

34
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,599
and the life of her parents.

35
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,499
I have control over them all.

36
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,830
What do you have?

37
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,700
Let me make a reasonable offer.

38
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,909
Lee Yeon, if you give up your body,
I will let everyone else live.

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,849
What do I look like to you?

40
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,330
Seogyeong Traitor.

41
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,529
You're the one who
took my parents!

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,120
This is the carnation
I folded for them.

43
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,550
Flip it over.

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,029
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

45
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:43,099
Ji A, why won't you save us?

46
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,969
Are they alive?

47
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,870
- Where?
- Bring me the mountain spirit,

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,270
and I'll return
your parents to you.

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,640
- Tell me where they are!
- You saw them,

50
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,610
but failed to recognize them.

51
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,180
What do you mean by that?

52
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,279
You'll soon find out.

53
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,550
I won't let you
get away with this.

54
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,719
Call the cops then or
perhaps your boyfriend.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,050
Any option will do,

56
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,120
but you won't ever see
your parents again.

57
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,620
Why? Why my parents?

58
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,330
Because I knew this
day would come.

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,400
You would do anything
to save your parents.

60
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,930
Just like how you saved your
father in your past life,

61
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,000
I hope that you'll once
again make a wise choice.

62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,210
You'll let everyone go
if I give up my body?

63
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,150
Ji A, her parents,
and even Rang?

64
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,619
I'd like the entire package,

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,820
but just the heart will also do.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,330
Are you serious?

67
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,229
I am.

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,929
So what will it be? Yes or no?

69
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,229
I...

70
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,010
I...

71
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,880
I don't want to.

72
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,320
- Why not?
- Because you seem like the type...

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,950
to go back on a deal.

74
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,760
I don't do business
with those kinds.

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,359
I'll personally free
them all from your grip.

76
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,590
Then enjoy...

77
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,700
trampling on those you treasure.

78
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,500
I know this isn't
appropriate to ask,

79
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,369
but why did you come back?

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,969
As if anyone would welcome...

81
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:31,840
the symbol of calamity,
plague, and war.

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,039
If you're asking me my view of
the world, I don't have one.

83
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,039
All I want is one thing.

84
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,909
I want that woman.

85
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,919
The woman who was supposed to be
offered to me as a sacrifice...

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,549
but ended up saving
you and killing me.

87
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,190
I like her.

88
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,390
How dare you?

89
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,469
That's enough. I just
wanted to test your power.

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,840
For me, this is
just the beginning.

91
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,219
"I want to die. Now."

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,630
Do you feel it?

93
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,869
I knew it. You're
connected to him.

94
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,710
- What?
- You are his shell.

95
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,039
Why are you doing this?

96
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,510
You're also human.

97
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,179
I'm human, so I don't want to
die, and I have so many desires.

98
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:28,060
Was committing treason
not enough for you?

99
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,830
All I did was dream
of a new world...

100
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,060
after having been
born as a lowlife.

101
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,859
My kids, wife, and mother.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
All I wanted to do was make
sure they could eat proper food.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
But they called it treason
and threatened to behead me.

104
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,270
And that's when I met him.

105
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,510
I'm sure it wasn't for free.

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,109
What did you have to give in return
for being able to stay alive?

107
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,179
My kids, wife, and mother.

108
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,750
I offered my family to Imoogi
and was able live in return.

109
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,450
You're crazy.

110
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,289
You must lose something in
order to gain something.

111
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,989
So you want me to sell Yeon out?

112
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,900
You want me to become
someone like you?

113
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,830
The choice is yours, Ji A.

114
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,400
Because of you, your parents
were gone for half their lives.

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,799
You can either see them
at their funeral or...

116
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,010
One drop of this
will be enough...

117
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,150
to make him fall
into a deep sleep.

118
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,779
Put Yeon to sleep.

119
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,820
Then you can get the life
you've always dreamed of.

120
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,399
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 11: GROUND CHERRIES</font>

121
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,040
I told you we should've
gotten a massage chair.

122
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,869
We'll only end up using
it as a clothing rack.

123
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,040
It's a waste of money.

124
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,009
I'm old now, so my body
isn't as healthy as...

125
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,210
Will you put some
strength into your hands?

126
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,119
Got it.

127
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:07,649
Bok Gil used to
give great massages.

128
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,489
He was also worried that you were
always working day and night,

129
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,330
so he'd gather the bark of hardy
rubber trees and Siberian ginseng...

130
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,060
and boil them for your joints...

131
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,700
I don't want to hear you
talking about that unfilial son.

132
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,879
Don't call my son unfilial.

133
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,349
Get out.

134
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,530
Why do you keep acting
like you're the only one...

135
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,899
who's heartbroken because
of our son's death?

136
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:50,859
I said get out!

137
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,200
It was because of you.

138
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
He wouldn't have
committed suicide...

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,469
if you hadn't killed his wife.

140
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,280
She was possessed with a
ghost that causes plagues.

141
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,550
I couldn't just sit back and
watch the entire nation...

142
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,050
suffer from a plague
because of her.

143
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,410
Exactly.

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,780
That's who you are.

145
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,849
You're neither Bok Gil's
mother nor my wife.

146
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,290
You're just the gatekeeper
of the Samdo River.

147
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,460
Meanwhile, I've been
trying so hard...

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,229
to understand you for so long, but
I guess that was foolish of me.

149
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,670
I don't even want to
look at you. Just leave!

150
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,109
<font color="#00ff00">132 PEOPLE COMMITTED

152
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,190
It's Imoogi, isn't it?

153
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,879
You have two days to
bring me Lee Yeon.

154
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,840
It's his body I need.

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,479
Rather than thinking
about breaking the deal,

156
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,210
think of a way to
untangle the mess.

157
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,349
Imoogi, that scumbag.

158
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,219
What in the world has he done?

<font color="#00ff00">"UNPRECEDENTED MASS
SUICIDE, CITIZENS IN SHOCK"</font>

160
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,629
Can you believe this?

161
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,499
It's like a horror movie.

162
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:29,660
How could 132 people
in the same district...

163
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,999
all commit suicide
at the same time?

164
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,269
Do you think they were some
kind of a suicide group?

165
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,469
There wasn't a
single will found.

166
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:38,109
People who commit suicide
normally feel the urge...

167
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:41,509
to let people know
why they chose to die.

168
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,710
Or maybe it was a cult.

169
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,950
In the 1970s, a group of cult
believers in Jonestown...

170
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,210
committed mass suicide.

171
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,649
They all drank poison,

172
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,349
but this time, the causes
of death are all different.

173
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,090
This is so weird.

174
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,489
I'm back.

175
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,060
Hey, Terry. You're back.

176
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,330
Hey, wait. You were at
Geumran-gu. Hey, are you...

177
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,399
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

178
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,099
- Pardon?
- Didn't you see the news?

179
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,999
An hour ago, a group
of people died there.

180
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,469
- Really?
- Where is Ji A?

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,899
Didn't she come with you?

182
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,940
She left early saying
something urgent came up.

183
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,739
- Isn't she at the office?
- Really?

184
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,379
I didn't see her come back.

185
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,609
- Here's the footage I took.
- Thank you.

186
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,519
How was it today?

187
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,649
Did Ji A give you a hard time?

188
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,090
No, not at all.
She's really kind.

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,660
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A</font>

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,940
<font color="#00ff00">NAM JI A</font>

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,619
Bring me the mountain spirit,

192
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,190
and I'll return
your parents to you.

193
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,399
<font color="#00ff00">LEE YEON</font>

194
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,109
<font color="#00ff00">JI A, WHY WON'T YOU SAVE US?</font>

195
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,080
Come in.

196
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:28,849
My goodness.

197
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,019
This place is nice.

198
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,820
The living room is spacious,
but there aren't a lot of rooms.

199
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,729
I guess vets make
a lot of money.

200
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,969
Come this way.

201
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,540
Have a seat.

202
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,660
This is...

203
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,859
It's borscht, a
traditional Russian dish.

204
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,030
I know you probably didn't
grow up eating this.

205
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,030
But I thought you might miss
the smell of where you're from.

206
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't you like it?

207
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,710
I sometimes miss the forest
where I was born and grew up in.

208
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,739
Right now, it's turned
into an apartment complex.

209
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,690
I know this smell.
I also like it.

210
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,670
On top of that, it's delicious.

211
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,269
Eat up.

212
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,180
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,489
Geomdoong?

214
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:48,889
Mister.

215
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,629
You brat. Get back here.

216
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,930
Don't annoy me. I will kill you.

217
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:57,660
Who's this?

218
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,399
My stepdad.

219
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,969
Come out. Get over here.

220
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,609
You choose.

221
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,269
You ask me for help,

222
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:09,580
I'll make sure you never
have to see him again.

223
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,149
Or I'll just go my way.

224
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,619
Hey you. Do you know him?

225
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,780
Why are you butting
into our family matter?

226
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,050
Quiet. I'm waiting
to hear his response.

227
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,489
What are you? Are you a cop?

228
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,090
So...

229
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,399
I...

230
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,129
Soo Ho. Answer wisely. Got it?

231
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,639
I have to go home.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Okay.

233
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,399
Yu Ri, who has no
friends or family.

234
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,869
- What?
- I can't live without chicken,

235
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,340
but if you want to eat
Russian food at every meal,

236
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,439
I'm willing to change
my preferences.

237
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,179
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,980
I'm saying I want to become...

239
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,980
your family and your friend.

240
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,220
Family... Well,

241
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,429
I have something
similar to that.

242
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,359
Your fake mom and dad
that Lee Rang gave you?

243
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,000
The department store owner?

244
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,459
Yes.

245
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm their dead daughter's
fill-in and just an empty shell,

246
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,169
but they can't live without me.

247
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,540
People say...

248
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,980
they'd like to throw away their
family if no one was watching.

249
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,139
Because they make life
hard on each other.

250
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,020
But then again, you
end up going back...

251
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,250
and taking them back.

252
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,349
Like Lee Yeon and Mr. Lee?

253
00:17:58,449 --> 00:17:59,720
Right.

254
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,189
So...

255
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,429
Let the department owners
have their lives back,

256
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,859
and become a true
family with me and...

257
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,300
What are you guys doing here?

258
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,629
- Mr. Lee!
- Yeon?

259
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,970
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:17,340
I live here.

261
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,939
Hey. Have you seen Ji A?

262
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,709
She wasn't here. Why?

263
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,639
She isn't at the office
either. Where is she?

264
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,750
Anyway, keep doing whatever it
was with the necklace thief.

265
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,220
This is Yeon's house?

266
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,090
It's okay. His
house is my house.

267
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,290
Did you just laugh?

268
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,090
Sorry. Let's eat.

269
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,570
Mr. Lee?

270
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,040
What?

271
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,639
What are you doing here?

272
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,909
I felt like I could see
you if I hung around here.

273
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,879
You weren't answering your phone
all day long. Did something happen?

274
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,090
Yes.

275
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:41,520
Me too.

276
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,359
What happened?

277
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:45,859
But first...

278
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:47,790
Ta-da.

279
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,830
Open it.

280
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,109
Something that makes you happy
just by thinking about it.

281
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,919
You remembered.

282
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,949
Of course.

283
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,790
The smell of freshly cooked rice,
a complete set of world literature,

284
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,090
Dad's handmade
gimbap, new sneakers,

285
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,990
and me.

286
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,060
Buy one, get one free.

287
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,270
They say if you buy your girlfriend
sneakers, she'll run away.

288
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,869
Even if you run away, I want
you to wear new sneakers...

289
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,639
and only go on nice paths.

290
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,119
Why are you smiling so sadly?

291
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:47,590
Do you not like them?

292
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,590
I do.

293
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,030
I never knew that the
word "sneakers"...

294
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,429
had such a sweet meaning.

295
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,800
I like you.

296
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,909
So much that I wouldn't regret
exchanging my life for you.

297
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:19,919
Should we take a walk?

298
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,159
On a nice path.

299
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,189
Together.

300
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,530
What's this?

301
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:38,139
What else? A fresh human.

302
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:39,740
Who is he?

303
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,240
None of your concern.

304
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,139
Turn him into a ground
cherry for emergency food.

305
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:47,310
Much obliged.

306
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,659
He moved the ground
cherry pot somewhere else?

307
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:00,429
Do you want to watch?

308
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,899
Are you allowed to show me?

309
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,129
There's nothing to
hide between us.

310
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,540
It looks like an ordinary
seed, doesn't it?

311
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,770
It traps the body and soul,

312
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,780
so I call it a latch
for the body and soul.

313
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,449
Only Imoogi can create it.

314
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,990
What an evil soul.

315
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:05,859
He was in and out of prison...

316
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,429
Did you save a little kid?

317
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:13,270
I need at least one good deed...

318
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,099
to defend myself with when
I enter the Afterlife.

319
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:28,349
- Do you want more milk?
- Yes.

320
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,619
Eat up.

321
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:32,550
Stop eating already.
That milk is mine.

322
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,889
Why doesn't that lady go home?

323
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:37,619
You go home.

324
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,659
Or I'll eat your liver.

325
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,429
I don't have a home anymore.

326
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,570
Stop acting all pathetic.

327
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,199
Thousands of people in
Seoul don't have a home.

328
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,770
- Are you homeless too?
- Not me.

329
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,109
Stop fighting.

330
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,580
Soo Ho, right? Where's your mom?

331
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,050
My mom got beat up
every single day...

332
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,820
and ran away with
some guy I don't know.

333
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:08,720
That's why my stepdad
was so mad at me.

334
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,290
So you must have nowhere to go.

335
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,659
Oh, my gosh.

336
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,699
Mr. Lee, why are you
doing this to me?

337
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:16,800
Eat up.

338
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,909
What are you thinking about?

339
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,220
You know the story "The
Little Mermaid", right?

340
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,290
Andersen?

341
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,849
Yes.

342
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:45,320
Ever since I was a child,
I hated the ending.

343
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,929
She could've lived if she
had killed the prince.

344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,459
So why did she
turn into sea foam?

345
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,740
What about you? What would
you do if it were you?

346
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,470
A long time ago, I thought I'd
definitely kill the prince...

347
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,369
and save myself.

348
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,939
But? Have you changed your mind?

349
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:06,010
Now that I've met the prince,

350
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,149
I grew to like him much
more than I imagined.

351
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,320
Although if the
prince were gone,

352
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,459
the fairy tale could
end with a happy ending.

353
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,500
If I were the little mermaid,

354
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,070
I'd kill the sea witch.

355
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,770
I'd rather not be her plaything.

356
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:43,980
I've been cursed.

357
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,649
I could have my parents
back if I sell you out.

358
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,099
I've heard their wish,

359
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,230
so tell me yours.

360
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,300
I want my voice back...

361
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,300
and find my prince.

362
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,270
All while not turning
into sea foam.

363
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,280
So come witch-hunting with me.

364
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,109
Are you sure you
can spare such time?

365
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:17,580
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

366
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,689
It may very well be
my last living day,

367
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,530
so what's it to you
whether or not...

368
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:30,030
I let it go to waste?

369
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,760
You'll just throw
your life away?

370
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,270
For the brother you loathe?

371
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,470
Imoogi met with Lee Yeon today.

372
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,780
He let your brother know
of our three hostages.

373
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,280
Ji A, her parents, and you.

374
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,050
Where do you think
he is right now?

375
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,090
Has he even called
you in concern?

376
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,060
Liar.

377
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,030
You've been
abandoned once again.

378
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:10,040
You're right. I did abandon you.

379
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,399
I'm sorry...

380
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,070
for saving you after your
human mother abandoned you.

381
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,639
Yeon...

382
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,609
I never abandoned you.

383
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,119
He said he never
once abandoned me.

384
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,030
You of all people
know that it's a lie.

385
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,659
- Hey, kid!
- Yeon?

386
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:42,740
He saved me from the
Forest of the Starved.

387
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,599
He had to in order to save Ji A.

388
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,169
You're nothing but disposable.

389
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:48,409
Shut it!

390
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:50,780
Lee Yeon will do
anything for Ji A...

391
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,879
even if that
involves killing you.

392
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,520
If you go after her,

393
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,820
I'll kill you for
real this time.

394
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,629
Will you give up your life...

395
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,659
for a brother who only
cares for his girl?

396
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,349
Yes, Mr. Lee.

397
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,929
What? Shin Ju?

398
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:42,599
He wants to talk to you.

399
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,699
This is Shin Ju.

400
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,099
You know, right? Where's Yeon?

401
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,869
He went to see Ms. Nam.

402
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,169
So where?

403
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,470
I'll call you back
with an answer.

404
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,750
It's 132 people.

405
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,419
The number of dead people
who aren't on the list is...

406
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,149
There will be more.

407
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,659
- What?
- He is chaos itself.

408
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,189
We're only getting started.

409
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:15,929
Then let's bring him in. Tell
me how, and I'll do it myself.

410
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,629
It's beyond your capacity.

411
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,699
In order to bring him in,

412
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,270
you'll have to do what
you hate with passion.

413
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,439
And what may that be?

414
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,939
Hey, Yeon. You're here.

415
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,859
What? My gosh, you...

416
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,629
Hello, sir and ma'am.

417
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:48,459
I'm Nam Ji A.

418
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:08,045
Well, Yeon told us
a lot about you.

419
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:09,345
It's nice to meet you.

420
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,714
You!

421
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:15,184
How dare you bring a
living person here?

422
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:16,914
I know she's a living person,

423
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:20,224
but she's also at the center of
the argument you were having.

424
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:29,394
You have stepped in here
far too early. Go back.

425
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,035
I'm well aware that you highly
value rules and principles.

426
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,565
I came here knowing
the risks because...

427
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:36,805
Do I look like your
fairy godmother?

428
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:39,805
- What the...
- Hold it.

429
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,075
Or maybe...

430
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,815
you'd like to know when you die.

431
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:47,315
No. I stay away from fortune
tellers since I hate spoilers...

432
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:48,684
even about my own life.

433
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:51,785
- Then what?
- I lost my parents at nine.

434
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,954
This isn't a place
for your sob story.

435
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:56,825
I hear that I possess something
that belongs to Imoogi.

436
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,855
That's also the fate
you were handed.

437
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:02,934
I plan to defy that fate
until my last breath.

438
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,335
It is why I came here knowing
that it wasn't a place...

439
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,605
for living people.

440
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:14,605
- She's just like you.
- Yes, we were made for each other.

441
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,315
I admire you not being
intimidated by me.

442
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:20,914
So tell me why you're here.

443
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,755
Let me borrow Clairvoyance.

444
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,884
I wish to know where
my parents are.

445
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:30,325
- What?
- It won't be for free.

446
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:32,424
As if you have anything
to offer in return.

447
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,265
I'd let you overcharge
me knowingly,

448
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,565
but I don't have much to spare.

449
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:41,065
Then with what will
you strike a deal?

450
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,105
We'll bring you Imoogi.

451
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,875
Yeon and I.

452
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,795
Gosh, I made it out alive.

453
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,164
Didn't you see me
trembling in there?

454
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:10,295
It hardly seemed like the case.

455
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:13,664
I thought that past lives
and the Afterlife...

456
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,565
only existed in comic books,

457
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:16,974
but they're real.

458
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,875
Sinners only have
better lives...

459
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,775
until they take
their last breaths.

460
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:26,144
Do you help the dead cross
Samdo River from here?

461
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:29,214
I give a presentation about
what to expect in the Afterlife,

462
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,755
catch those who refuse
to cross the river,

463
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:34,055
and keep my wife happy.

464
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,954
I'm glad...

465
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:40,724
that someone as considerate
as you is the first person...

466
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,595
people meet after passing.

467
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,605
You grew up well even though...

468
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,734
you lost your parents
at a young age.

469
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,035
They'll be incredibly
proud of you.

470
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,805
Will I ever get
to see them again?

471
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,785
Let's trust Yeon and
believe that he'll deliver.

472
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,724
This isn't like you, Granny.

473
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,525
Why do you say that?

474
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:14,795
Because you would've
turned Imoogi into stone...

475
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,795
way before he became a problem.

476
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:20,405
I remember how you turned...

477
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:22,264
the northern mountain
spirit into one...

478
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:23,605
just for getting
on your wrong side.

479
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:24,804
So why...

480
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:28,644
is Imoogi an exception?

481
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:31,144
Because I don't want
to see you go crazy.

482
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:37,255
- What do you mean by that?
- A piece of him lies with her.

483
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:38,655
The Imoogi.

484
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,824
Is there a way...

485
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,864
to free her from it?

486
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:50,264
No.

487
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:52,864
Either she dies...

488
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,635
or the Imoogi leaves
her voluntarily.

489
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:58,534
I don't believe that. How can
a piece of it be with her?

490
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,875
You must've heard
something about it.

491
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:06,485
Despite your best efforts,
Imoogi was awoken.

492
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:09,385
The girl will be sacrificed,

493
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:14,085
and the rest of your life
will be nothing but painful.

494
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,655
That...

495
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,324
is your fate.

496
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:25,735
Now I get why you didn't
want me to find her.

497
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:31,574
From the start, you
said we shouldn't meet.

498
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,045
You didn't want me
to get hurt again.

499
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,074
You didn't want me dragged
into that fate again.

500
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:46,085
Thanks, Granny.

501
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,795
But still, I choose her.

502
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:56,025
My only purpose in life
was to meet her again.

503
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,905
It looks like...

504
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:02,405
you'll always end up
making the same choice.

505
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,405
The ground cherries.

506
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,744
That's where her parents are.

507
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,925
Let's go.

508
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:28,795
- We'll be off now.
- Oh, okay.

509
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,235
If anything happens,

510
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:34,034
come here and repeat
my name three times.

511
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,565
I don't know if you'll win or
lose the fight against fate,

512
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,074
but I still want
to bet on you guys.

513
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:39,905
Thank you.

514
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:42,875
You should go now.

515
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:54,425
Did you find out?

516
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:55,954
The ground cherries.

517
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,195
"Ground cherries"?

518
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,695
I've never seen ground
cherries in Seoul before.

519
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,025
Are these ground cherries?

520
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:04,034
That's where my mom and dad are?

521
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:06,505
How?

522
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,105
That plant can trap the body
and soul of a living person.

523
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,704
And he used that to lengthen
the lives of his followers.

524
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:14,804
Let's go. It was
in the living room.

525
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,074
It was in the center
of the living room.

526
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:17,414
He probably moved
it somewhere else.

527
00:36:17,414 --> 00:36:18,744
It wasn't there
when I last went.

528
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,735
Our deal expires in 24 hours.

529
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:10,264
You drove a wedge
between the two brothers.

530
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,434
Do you think Rang
will fall for it?

531
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,534
Yes, he will.

532
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:16,635
Rang has a deep-rooted
obsession for his brother.

533
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,835
It's a lot more
twisted than you think.

534
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:21,875
You think he can kill
him because he loves him?

535
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:23,715
Leave this to me.

536
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,114
I'll bring you Yeon's heart.

537
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:27,545
Don't look down on him.

538
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:30,255
The reason I got defeated
by him long ago...

539
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,215
was because I
underestimated him.

540
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,755
That's why I set up three traps.

541
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,425
We just need one of
them to fall for it.

542
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,594
Once this is over,
I'll go into politics.

543
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:43,034
I'm sick of pretending to be the
CEO of a broadcasting company.

544
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:45,735
- And I deserve a reward.
- Whatever you want.

545
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,175
You little monster.

546
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:56,715
Where do you think
he is right now?

547
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,585
Has he even called
you in concern?

548
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,485
You've been
abandoned once again.

549
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:03,184
Will you give up your life...

550
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,954
for a brother who only
cares for his girl?

551
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:17,465
- Yeon.
- Were there ground cherries...

552
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:18,735
at Imoogi's house?

553
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,764
Ji A's parents are
trapped inside there.

554
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:22,034
Do you know anything about that?

555
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:27,175
Is that all you
have to say to me?

556
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:29,445
Did you see the cherries or not?

557
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:31,744
I did.

558
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,885
Where did he hide the cherries?

559
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:35,744
I don't know that much.

560
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:38,554
- Bye.
- I can find out.

561
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:41,184
The CEO values it as
much as his own life.

562
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,925
- Really?
- Let's meet tomorrow.

563
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,494
Let's talk about it then.

564
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,644
Rang told me he'll look into it.
I'm going to meet him tomorrow.

565
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,114
Where? What time?
Should I go with you?

566
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:13,525
Leave it to me.

567
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,625
I need you to do the thing
that only you can do.

568
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:22,664
What are you guys doing here?

569
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:24,195
We got too worried about her...

570
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,894
after knowing her boyfriend
is a nine-tailed fox.

571
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,034
- Ji A.
- What?

572
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,835
How did you know where I live?

573
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:32,204
Director Nam once did a
background check on you.

574
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,844
Why did you come
all the way here?

575
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:36,074
We came to see if you're safe.

576
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:39,045
I won't ever approve
of a nine-tailed fox...

577
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:42,815
Actually, I take that back.
How big is this living room?

578
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,525
I didn't think it was right
to visit empty-handedly.

579
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:51,594
- What is it?
- It's just a snack.

580
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:54,625
Mealworms?

581
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,494
I asked a friend who
directs an animal show,

582
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:58,034
and he told me foxes love it.

583
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:01,235
I had trouble choosing between
mealworms and crickets.

584
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:02,505
You can go ahead and enjoy it.

585
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,105
Did you guys eat dinner?

586
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,144
- No.
- I'll order.

587
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:57,324
Only the fox's death can
break a deal made by a fox.

588
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:07,565
<font color="#00ff00">GOBOON'S TRIPE RESTAURANT</font>

589
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,244
They wrap it in a bundle?

590
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:15,105
Let me eat with them first.

591
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:26,054
The CEO was the accomplice
of the mummy case?

592
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:29,385
I asked him about the nail I
found, and he admitted everything.

593
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:30,625
Why don't you call the cops?

594
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,855
And say what?

595
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:35,465
That our CEO is from Goryeo?

596
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:38,534
And that he's a follower of Imoogi
and goes around killing people?

597
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:39,835
You think they'll believe that?

598
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:41,135
You're right.

599
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:43,235
Then why not let Detective
Baek put on those glasses...

600
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:45,005
that show you
people's past lives?

601
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,804
Once he sees
people's past lives,

602
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,304
he might believe that
there's a guy from Goryeo.

603
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:52,474
Are you sure he graduated from
the best university in Korea?

604
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:54,085
He's a nice guy.

605
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,585
Why aren't you eating anything?

606
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,954
You didn't eat the mealworms,
and you're not eating any tripe.

607
00:41:58,985 --> 00:42:00,255
Do you eat people's livers?

608
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:04,554
You're making me
crave it a little.

609
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:14,304
It's pretty good.

610
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,505
I know this is rude,
but do you have a tail?

611
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:18,775
Why would you ask if
you know it's rude?

612
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,375
I still can't believe that
you're a nine-tailed fox.

613
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:23,005
Yes, he has one. I saw it.

614
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:24,815
Unbelievable. Then do you also
put a leaf on your forehead...

615
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,315
and transform yourself?

616
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:27,485
That's a raccoon.

617
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,914
And I do know how to transform, but
I don't because it's not classy.

618
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:32,485
Show us! Show us!

619
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:33,824
You punk.

620
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,625
- My gosh, just eat.
- Just eat the food.

621
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,804
I'll do it.

622
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:01,585
What made you change your mind?

623
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:03,855
I want to live.

624
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,824
Do you really think you can
take out your brother's heart?

625
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:13,025
You can take out his heart.

626
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:15,625
I'll lure him to you.

627
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,565
You have such a tender heart.

628
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:23,034
Take this.

629
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,905
And lure Yeon to the
location I tell you to.

630
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:32,074
From now on, we'll
be moving together.

631
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:34,844
You can sleep here tonight.

632
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:22,824
He's so fit to work at
a broadcasting company.

633
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,494
- You should keep working here.
- You're too kind.

634
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,405
Did you buy everything
this morning?

635
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:28,405
Yes.

636
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:31,034
- Eat up.
- It looks good. Let's eat.

637
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:32,905
When did you get so close?

638
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:35,344
Hey. He's a real piece of work.

639
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:38,574
He knows history, literature,
arts, religion, everything.

640
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:39,945
He's a walking encyclopedia.

641
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,485
He was useful on the field too.

642
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:44,114
Remember the foreign language
papers on past lives?

643
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,784
He translated the English,
French, and Chinese papers...

644
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,925
all last night.

645
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,255
What's your secret?

646
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:53,155
I never left home when I was
young because of my health.

647
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,894
I was alone other than
for my babysitter.

648
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,934
So all I did was read.

649
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:11,514
Good morning. So this
was where you all were.

650
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:13,885
Nice. Who picked up sandwiches?

651
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:17,385
- It's mine.
- Just one. Don't be cheap.

652
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,655
Urban Legends team, we
have a team dinner tonight.

653
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:24,295
- I'm out.
- Me too.

654
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:26,625
No, no, no. No
investigations, no editing,

655
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,994
no excuses will
work today. Why not?

656
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:30,835
Because it's Terry's
welcome dinner.

657
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,684
Hey.

658
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,554
What are you doing here?

659
00:45:57,195 --> 00:45:58,295
Making coffee.

660
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:01,425
What's with these flowers
that don't suit you at all?

661
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:04,195
So that you can enjoy the
scent of our old home.

662
00:46:04,534 --> 00:46:07,434
Pick one that you like.
Women love this stuff.

663
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:10,375
That was thoughtful of you.

664
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,184
So? Where are the ground
cherries? Did you find out?

665
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:57,414
What's the rush?

666
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,885
I don't have time to chit chat.

667
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,655
- What?
- I don't have time either.

668
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:07,065
But still, listen to
what I have to say.

669
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:10,864
What is it?

670
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,465
What am I to you?

671
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,344
Where did things
get twisted again?

672
00:47:23,445 --> 00:47:25,014
I've done all I could.

673
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:26,844
What's the problem this time?

674
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,144
Answer me.

675
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:31,184
What am I to you?

676
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,324
You're family.

677
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:38,755
Sickening family that thinks
just because we had the same dad,

678
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,324
you had the right to do all
sorts of wicked things to me.

679
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,934
Don't think I'll feed
you flowery words...

680
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,405
just because you
surrounded me with flowers.

681
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:53,074
I'm sick of your
whining at your age!

682
00:47:56,344 --> 00:47:58,315
You're so mean to me...

683
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:02,215
when you're endlessly
magnanimous to her.

684
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,855
Yes. Because she's
much tougher than you.

685
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,925
She doesn't cling onto her
family tragedy like a loser...

686
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:09,585
and whine like somebody.

687
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,525
Isn't it odd?

688
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,934
You were never once
a nice brother,

689
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:21,105
but shone in my
eyes as if you were.

690
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,405
You seemed perfect.

691
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:26,835
I wanted...

692
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,804
to become like you.

693
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,715
Drink it.

694
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:41,784
What if you spiked it?

695
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:47,925
Calm down. I'm just kidding.

696
00:49:11,085 --> 00:49:13,724
So? Where are the
ground cherries?

697
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:15,925
Wait. We'll find them soon.

698
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:19,494
Don't you dare try
anything funny.

699
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:21,764
After you saved me from
the Forest of the Starved,

700
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:23,835
I thought...

701
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:31,005
I should die for you someday...

702
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,304
in order to save you.

703
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:39,244
But you know, I
realized I couldn't.

704
00:49:39,945 --> 00:49:41,085
I want to live.

705
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:44,855
That's why...

706
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,985
I need you to die, big brother.

707
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:03,905
Do you want to fight?

708
00:50:04,905 --> 00:50:07,704
I can't beat you if we
fight fair and square.

709
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,514
The coffee.

710
00:50:26,894 --> 00:50:30,364
If you cared for me even a fraction
of how much you worry about her,

711
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:33,494
I wouldn't have done this.

712
00:50:34,835 --> 00:50:36,204
I could never.

713
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:43,105
You idiot.

714
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:40,005
We got Lee Yeon.

715
00:51:43,474 --> 00:51:45,045
Wait until I get there.

716
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:46,574
Don't call me on
this phone again.

717
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:56,724
Darn it. Does he think I'm
his lackey or something?

718
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,474
Hey. Here. Come here.

719
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:13,434
Sit down. Sit. Okay.

720
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:16,574
Okay, then. Fill your
glasses everyone.

721
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:18,514
I'll fill yours, Terry.

722
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,115
Okay. Here you go.

723
00:52:21,115 --> 00:52:23,244
- Thank you.
- I'll pour my own.

724
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,324
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

725
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,255
- Thank you.
- Drink up.

726
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:34,865
Gosh. I wish I had
a son like him.

727
00:52:35,594 --> 00:52:39,135
He's handsome,
smart... He's so...

728
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,534
My gosh. He's so
fit. He's solid.

729
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:46,374
He's totally... Sure.
You're a good kid.

730
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:49,204
I'm starting to
respect Mr. Choi now.

731
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:51,574
How is he so unchanging?

732
00:52:59,684 --> 00:53:01,255
I'm going to get some air.

733
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:06,824
Terry, where are you going?

734
00:53:15,335 --> 00:53:16,934
I need to meet
someone for a bit.

735
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:18,235
I'll be right back.

736
00:53:18,304 --> 00:53:20,204
Where did you
learn such manners?

737
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:22,704
- Sorry?
- Who leaves a dinner...

738
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:23,945
without saying anything?

739
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:25,275
Especially the guest of honor.

740
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:30,684
- I'm sorry.
- I have a lot of questions for you.

741
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:33,954
Like what, for instance?

742
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:38,624
What's your favorite book?

743
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:41,624
- "A Lover's Discourse: Fragments".
- By Roland Barthes?

744
00:53:41,664 --> 00:53:42,764
Have you read it?

745
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:44,195
I got baited by the title.

746
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,565
I thought it'd
teach me about love,

747
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:49,164
but to understand
his language of love,

748
00:53:49,264 --> 00:53:51,974
one needs at least
a master's degree.

749
00:53:52,974 --> 00:53:54,545
He wrote many beautiful phrases.

750
00:53:55,105 --> 00:53:58,175
"He praises her perfection..."

751
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:01,344
"and praises himself..."

752
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:03,315
"for choosing pure perfection."

753
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:08,124
Meanwhile, I praise cocktails.

754
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:09,925
Come on.

755
00:54:24,835 --> 00:54:26,735
I have five minutes
left. End our deal.

756
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:31,715
Our deal ends when I
have Lee Yeon's heart.

757
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:34,445
I brought him to
you as promised.

758
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:37,315
Now announce the
end of our deal.

759
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,715
Can't you see I'm
waiting for Imoogi?

760
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:41,284
Being rude, are we?

761
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:42,755
I bet it drives you crazy.

762
00:54:43,925 --> 00:54:46,394
You can't kill the one
who you owe a favor.

763
00:54:52,764 --> 00:54:54,405
Once a slave, always a slave.

764
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:57,164
You can't do anything without
your master's approval.

765
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:58,704
Watch what you say.

766
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:01,804
You're still bound to
me by the favor you owe.

767
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:04,874
You serve a creature that
sucked the blood of your family.

768
00:55:05,974 --> 00:55:07,074
Shut it.

769
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,144
How did it feel...

770
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:10,815
to watch your parents,
wife, and children die?

771
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:12,554
Did you cry?

772
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:15,054
- I told you to shut it.
- Then say it!

773
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,184
Say that our deal is over.

774
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:19,994
Fine. I'll end our deal...

775
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:22,525
in my own way.

776
00:55:34,304 --> 00:55:36,204
You've lost your mind.

777
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:39,514
No can do, I'm afraid.

778
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,485
I may be a worthless
piece of trash,

779
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:46,215
but I can't sacrifice my
family to get what I want.

780
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:50,085
You... Then you'll die.

781
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:52,355
I won't.

782
00:55:52,355 --> 00:55:54,664
Foxes die when they
go back on a deal.

783
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:57,324
And foxes...

784
00:55:58,865 --> 00:56:00,394
can change their appearances.

785
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,704
Although, I find it distasteful.

786
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:12,344
You and your desire
to seem graceful.

787
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:15,115
I thought you said
you'd only take a sip?

788
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:18,115
What's going on?

789
00:56:18,155 --> 00:56:19,315
Since when...

790
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:23,784
Since your place last night.

791
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:36,164
What are you...

792
00:56:37,505 --> 00:56:38,605
doing here?

793
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:46,715
I'm sorry.

794
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:50,014
I only thought you were
one of the hostages.

795
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:53,355
I didn't think
he'd kill everyone.

796
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:04,764
So how about you keep
living by my side?

797
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:11,405
No matter what I do,

798
00:57:12,735 --> 00:57:14,445
I can't be free of my deal.

799
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:16,105
There's a way.

800
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,215
How?

801
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,414
Swap places with me...

802
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:27,155
and bring me to him
just like he wants.

803
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:30,224
I'll do it.

804
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:32,355
Take this.

805
00:57:33,494 --> 00:57:35,124
You can sleep here tonight.

806
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:58,014
Darn you. How dare you!

807
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,094
You. Kill Lee Yeon right now...

808
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,434
Stop harassing my brother...

809
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:16,804
or I'll have to snap your neck.

810
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:21,105
So, the choice is yours.

811
00:58:21,775 --> 00:58:24,874
Kill Rang and have your
life ended by me. Or...

812
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,744
change his deal.

813
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,025
Save me and our
deal will be over.

814
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:00,815
The ground cherries...
Take me to where they are.

815
00:59:26,874 --> 00:59:28,844
- Here.
- We drink to get drunk.

816
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:30,844
- Darn it.
- But you're wasted, sir.

817
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:32,414
- But...
- Please drive safely. Bye!

818
00:59:32,414 --> 00:59:34,045
I'll get going then!

819
00:59:37,385 --> 00:59:39,514
Take my car instead. I called
for a designated driver.

820
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:43,184
- It's fine.
- But I'm not.

821
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,565
Sorry about that.
You can get going.

822
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:06,315
Ms. Nam.

823
01:00:07,344 --> 01:00:09,545
- Yes?
- Are you seeing someone?

824
01:00:10,414 --> 01:00:12,115
Yes, I am.

825
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:14,115
What's your boyfriend like?

826
01:00:16,184 --> 01:00:17,755
Like someone from a fairy tale.

827
01:00:18,855 --> 01:00:19,925
Break up with him.

828
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:24,025
- What?
- Fairy tales for grown-ups...

829
01:00:25,195 --> 01:00:27,465
tend to have savage endings.

830
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:41,115
So long. Thank you
for everything.

831
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:45,485
What a blabbermouth.

832
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:56,965
I no longer am bound.

833
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,264
Nice acting, by the way.

834
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:06,074
You were good enough
to be an actor.

835
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:07,775
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

836
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,065
Terry.

837
01:01:36,804 --> 01:01:39,335
Don't pretend with
the romantic feelings.

838
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,304
Because to me,

839
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:49,784
you're nothing...

840
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:52,585
but the thing that took
my parents from me.

841
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:55,784
I see you've known all along.

842
01:02:01,324 --> 01:02:03,264
Is that why you've
been keeping me here?

843
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:07,335
I need you to do the thing
that only you can do.

844
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:09,735
What only I can do?

845
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:12,534
While I search for
the ground cherries,

846
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:14,204
keep Imoogi occupied.

847
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:15,844
Imoogi?

848
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:18,374
Where is he?

849
01:02:18,744 --> 01:02:19,744
Someplace...

850
01:02:20,045 --> 01:02:22,315
much closer to you
than you think.

851
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:25,184
Much closer to me?

852
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,324
No way...

853
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:37,094
You seem unprotected...

854
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:38,635
for someone who knows
my true identity.

855
01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:42,635
Yeon told me...

856
01:02:43,465 --> 01:02:45,474
that you can't kill me.

857
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:49,505
He's right.

858
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:56,514
I'm quite fond of you.

859
01:04:47,094 --> 01:04:48,224
Mom.

860
01:04:52,094 --> 01:04:53,235
Dad.

861
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:40,974
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

862
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:42,945
<i>You probably wanted to warn me.</i>

863
01:05:43,585 --> 01:05:45,485
<i>I'll save your life
no matter what.</i>

864
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:47,485
<i>You're going to attack
Imoogi directly?</i>

865
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,184
<i>I'm going to find his weakness.</i>

866
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:51,795
<i>I'll kill those who
are precious to you.</i>

867
01:05:51,795 --> 01:05:53,394
<i>A bigger disaster is on its way.</i>

868
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:55,295
<i>Don't touch them.</i>

869
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:57,824
<i>Look carefully. I am you.</i>

870
01:05:58,094 --> 01:05:59,965
<i>Where is Ji A? Where is she?</i>

871
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:01,865
<i>A plague will hit this world.</i>

872
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:04,235
<i>No one will be happy.</i>

873
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:05,635
<i>Why does it have
to be Ji A? Why?</i>

874
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:08,275
<i>Turn everything back
to where it belongs.</i>
