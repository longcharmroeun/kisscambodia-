7
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,259
Hi.

8
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,970
What exited the well...

9
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,299
went into hiding immediately.

10
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,170
A piece of it was
found recently though.

11
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,140
A piece of it?

12
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,179
It can't be.

13
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,980
On her body.

14
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
She has lost the fox
bead you gave her.

15
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,620
In consequence, something
within her awoke.

16
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
What?

17
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,550
Why there...

18
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,819
of all places...

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,689
when it took her 600 years...

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,729
to finally be reborn?

21
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,000
All she wants...

22
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,840
is to live her life out...

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,970
as normally as possible
with her family.

24
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,370
So why...

25
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,710
Why is it within her?

26
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,220
That's her destiny.

27
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,090
Her destiny?

28
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,150
Says who?

29
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,259
What did she do to deserve this?

30
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,389
Do you dare to question
the higher powers...

31
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,500
at a place of the Almighty?

32
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,000
You already knew, didn't you?

33
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,000
It's why you constantly
told me to forget about her.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,039
Right now,

35
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,240
I feel like I've
been betrayed...

36
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,509
by a bank I trusted
my money with.

37
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:12,609
So?

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,050
I'll need a compensation.

39
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,780
I took you in and helped you
when you had absolutely nothing.

40
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,319
How dare you have the guts to
think that I owe you something?

41
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,599
Enough!

42
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,309
Relax, Yeon.

43
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,280
You too, honey.

44
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,849
Listen to me carefully.

45
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:24,590
If I find out that Ji A
will end up dying early,

46
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,820
I'll make a mess of the
Living Realm and Afterlife.

47
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,659
I don't even want to
look at you. Leave.

48
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:33,559
Did you see it?

49
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,869
I'm curious to
know how you feel.

50
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,539
I feel like I might cry.

51
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:45,609
I had to wait such
a long time...

52
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,280
to finally meet that person.

53
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,650
You have a lot on your mind.

54
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,559
- Pardon?
- You think I'm peculiar.

55
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,260
Am I no longer the
Imoogi you once knew?

56
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,960
If I've changed, that's
because the world has changed.

57
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,400
Imoogis and nine-tailed foxes
exist in a rapidly changing world.

58
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,869
There's no need to see the
world in an old-fashioned way.

59
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,210
Now, they will start
looking for us.

60
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,640
That's what I've
been waiting for.

61
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,749
I really can't wait
to meet that person.

62
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,220
She was pretty harsh, but
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

63
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,130
She's very cold-hearted,
but she cared for you...

64
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
like her own son.

65
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:46,570
Don't console me.

66
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,599
I'm already pretty
close to crying.

67
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,309
Yeon, don't get
swept up in this.

68
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,739
Just act like you
don't know anything.

69
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,650
Don't jump into fire when
you know it's dangerous.

70
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,749
But she'll be hurt
if I don't go.

71
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:02,919
You don't want...

72
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,249
to see the tragedy on replay.

73
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,789
If you get involved,
either one of you...

74
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,799
must die in the end.

75
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,470
That's become fate for
both you and her...

76
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,440
the moment that
thing was born again.

77
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,109
No, Ji A won't die. Never.

78
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,280
I made a promise.

79
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,390
I promised to help her live
a proper life this time.

80
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,789
I'll protect her even
if it ends my life.

81
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,109
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 7: THE TRAP OF SAMSARA</font>

82
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,590
There are more moments when a child
needs her parents than I thought.

83
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,429
For example, when the
child takes her first step.

84
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,929
Who else would be that
moved that you got up...

85
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,669
and took just a few
steps by yourself?

86
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:30,200
When I was the only one at a
picnic without a homemade lunch.

87
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,640
When the kid I fought
with in class said,

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,780
"I'm going to tell
my mom on you."

89
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,309
I couldn't beat kids with moms.

90
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,820
If only they were mean though.

91
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,450
If they were, I
might've been able...

92
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,890
to forget about them and
move on with my life.

93
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,859
Why have you been searching
for your parents all this time?

94
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,130
It's simple.

95
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,530
I miss them, that's all.

96
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,609
The fox bead?

97
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,280
I didn't know it
was that important.

98
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,649
You gave it to that
fortune-teller, didn't you?

99
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,359
He suddenly started talking
to me about my fate...

100
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,460
and promised to let you
go if I gave him that.

101
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,660
But still, how could you...

102
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,359
give it to him so easily
like a piece of candy?

103
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,399
Because I couldn't
afford to lose you.

104
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,979
I'm going to stay
here for a while.

105
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,310
You're going to stay?

106
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,649
At my house?

107
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,119
- You're going to live here?
- Yes.

108
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,019
I've never seen a nine-tailed
fox with such an open-mind.

109
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,590
Then do you want to
come to my place?

110
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,889
That's not what I meant.
Why all of a sudden?

111
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,619
It's the least I can
do for your safety.

112
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,930
Don't make me risk
my life to save you.

113
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,239
I was going to ask if you're
okay sleeping on the sofa.

114
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,950
You're using your
life to negotiate,

115
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,479
so it's hard to refuse.

116
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,519
Why are you up? I left
after I saw you fall asleep.

117
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,460
I had a bad dream.

118
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,359
- You had a dream?
- I saw a little boy.

119
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,060
And he said "Hi" to me.

120
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,099
- And then?
- That's it.

121
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,910
At first, it totally
creeped me out.

122
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,639
But after I woke up,

123
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,340
I felt pleasant to have
met him for some reason.

124
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,379
It felt like I knew
him or something.

125
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,330
Yes, he's the most precious
thing in your life.

126
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:08,759
Your brother.

127
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,239
I'll have a cola.

128
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,940
Why cola?

129
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,580
Last time, I got drunk and ate
the pigeons in my neighborhood.

130
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,749
I've been trying not
to drink after that.

131
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,950
I had enteritis.

132
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,349
Were you the one who
left a dead pigeon...

133
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,379
in front of my front door?

134
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,450
I went all the way there?

135
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,859
I don't remember.

136
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,859
What are you? A stray cat?

137
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,590
Did you fail to find what
you were looking for?

138
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,639
These glasses are the
eyebrows of a tiger?

139
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,840
So if I wear this, I can
see people's past lives?

140
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,979
Why do you look so sad?

141
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:58,479
- I'm not sad. I'm angry.
- Why?

142
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,019
I'm angry that I still have
the emotions of a human being.

143
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,050
Maybe it's because
I'm a half-blood.

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,560
Yes, you told me your
mother was human.

145
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,489
Did she hold you and
carry you on her back?

146
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,200
Did she catch chickens for you
and feed you all the nice parts?

147
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,430
You're making the
alcohol taste bad.

148
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,040
I just want to know how
it feels to be loved.

149
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,070
"Love"?

150
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,220
Mom.

151
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,269
Wait here for a moment.

152
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,680
No, I'm scared.

153
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,349
I'll be right back after
I gather hazelnuts.

154
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,649
Let me go with you. I
want to go with you.

155
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,519
Why do you give me
such a hard time?

156
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,190
I haven't given up on my
life just because of you.

157
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,849
Do you want the both
of us to just die?

158
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,979
Mom?

159
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,090
Love...

160
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,489
can get you killed.

161
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,759
The one who loves the other
person more becomes the prey.

162
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,800
I don't want that. I'd
rather be the predator.

163
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,739
Is it Shin Ju?

164
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,239
What has he done to sway you?

165
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,479
I'm surprised to hear
you talk about love.

166
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,019
I won't get swayed.

167
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,979
No matter what happens,

168
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,519
your enemies will
always be my enemies.

169
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:21,889
You should go.

170
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,619
I want to be alone.

171
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,639
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

172
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,979
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

173
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,879
We got a 99.

174
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,090
Mr. Lee and Ms.
Nam only got a 25.

175
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,259
See that?

176
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,460
According to the scientific
law of probabilities,

177
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,899
there is definitely
something there. Yes.

178
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,729
Even if she is from another country
that doesn't know Confucianism,

179
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,269
she kissed me on the cheek
when we first met, and...

180
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,040
What are you saying?

181
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,710
Why should I get neutered?

182
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,450
What, do you mean, I'm in
heat? Watch your mouth.

183
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:23,420
Anyway, your mom...

184
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:26,849
pretended she didn't like it, but
she finished the chicken soup.

185
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,759
She speaks meanly, but
she isn't a bad person.

186
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,960
You know that, right?

187
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,660
What? You want chicken soup?

188
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,930
You had your dog food
just half an hour ago.

189
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,330
You don't remember?

190
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:42,099
You're driving me crazy.

191
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Hey!

192
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,590
How long will you stand there?

193
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,519
- All night long.
- All night?

194
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,330
Don't mind me.

195
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,960
You're standing right
there, staring at me.

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,460
How could I not mind you?

197
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,930
Should I watch
from outside then?

198
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,239
That's out of a horror film.

199
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,470
You don't like this, you don't like
that. How can I protect you then?

200
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,009
Sleep on the couch.

201
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,249
No. It's outside of
the monitoring radius.

202
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,509
- Then sleep here.
- Okay.

203
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,619
I meant in the
room, not in my bed.

204
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,590
As I told you before, I'm modern.
I need a bed in order to sleep.

205
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,859
You can sleep on the
floor if you're afraid.

206
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,259
I'm not afraid.

207
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,249
Aren't you going to sleep?

208
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,749
I can't fall asleep.

209
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,690
My dad taught me
this a long time ago.

210
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:11,430
If you can't fall asleep,

211
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,930
imagine something that makes you
happy just thinking about it.

212
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,529
Like mint chocolate
chip ice cream?

213
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,340
For me, it's the smell
of freshly cooked rice.

214
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,050
The sound of a pencil
being sharpened.

215
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,720
New sneakers.

216
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,090
Pro baseball season.

217
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,930
A complete set of
world literature.

218
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:47,529
A puppy's toe beans.

219
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,700
Dad's handmade gimbap.

220
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,400
Something no one writes anymore.

221
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,809
A letter.

222
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,650
Your turn.

223
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,650
Are you asleep?

224
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,749
What? For me...

225
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,519
Red umbrella.

226
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,059
No!

227
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,370
What was that about?

228
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,870
Why are you smiling?

229
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,670
Wasn't I cool just now?

230
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:09,839
I moved quickly like
Spiderman, and...

231
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,979
The type I hate the most.

232
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,420
And his nose is running.

233
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,059
Mister. Do you like Spiderman?

234
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,759
- No.
- Why not?

235
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,960
- I just don't.
- I like him.

236
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,430
I don't care at all.

237
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,170
Stop talking to me.

238
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,370
I'm in a bad mood already
without your help.

239
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,670
I woke up at 4:30...

240
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,539
It's almost done. Almost done.

241
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,440
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

242
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,749
- Dried pollack soup?
- That's right.

243
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,910
Did you burn this?

244
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,279
You are impressive.

245
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,720
It's not burned. It's...
What do you call it?

246
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,190
I'm making dried
pollack soup, but...

247
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,259
Go buy more pollack.
I used it all up.

248
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:31,289
All of it?

249
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,799
I added sugar by mistake.

250
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,029
I'll do it. Step aside.

251
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,269
Hi.

252
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,210
Hey. Did you sleep well?

253
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,910
Yes.

254
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,539
Let's have breakfast.

255
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,450
Dried pollack soup is
the best for hangovers.

256
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,350
Did you make all of
this by yourself?

257
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,279
That isn't important.

258
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,519
- It's the thought that counts.
- That's awesome.

259
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,989
- Good morning, Ms. Nam!
- Oh, my gosh.

260
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,569
Why are you coming from there?

261
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,440
I heard you moved in together.

262
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,210
I had to bring Mr. Lee
fresh clothes anyway, so...

263
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,610
Where's the bleach?

264
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,809
Bleach? Why?

265
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,680
The hard water stains on
the sink are terrible.

266
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,210
I scrubbed the tiles with
baking soda and vinegar.

267
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,549
I have to clear the drain
of all the hair too. Also!

268
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,690
Don't let delivery food pile up
in the fridge. They're all germs.

269
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:07,920
- She's like a mother-in-law.
- Gosh.

270
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,890
I don't want to meddle
with someone else's home,

271
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,559
but Mr. Lee has never done
a chore in his entire life.

272
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,630
And he has OCD to boot.

273
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:17,660
- What was that, you punk?
- Enjoy your breakfast.

274
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,069
Where's the bleach?

275
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,299
It's in the bathroom.
Under the sink.

276
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,239
He should just keep looking.
Why did he come out and...

277
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,170
Hold on.

278
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,680
- Did you burn this?
- Well, not "burn" per se.

279
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,950
It's more like I failed at
controlling the temperature.

280
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,130
Why are you cute in the
midst of all of this?

281
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,499
The dried pollack is
dominating my body.

282
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,829
Cute? I'm over 1,000 years old.

283
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,999
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's eat.

284
00:22:58,739 --> 00:22:59,839
It's soft-boiled.

285
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,450
Eat up.

286
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes?

287
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,269
Ma'am.

288
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,799
Come in.

289
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,370
Here.

290
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,610
- Thank you.
- Sure.

291
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,210
So... Ms. Nam.

292
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,979
I know it's not my place
to say this, but...

293
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,650
Please be safe.

294
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,589
If you get hurt, Mr. Lee...

295
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:50,319
He'll be hurt 2, 3...
No, 10 times worse.

296
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,130
Yeon's so lucky.

297
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,100
He has a friend who
worries so much about him.

298
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,999
He's very precious to me.

299
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,470
I promise.

300
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,110
I'll do my best to be safe.

301
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:08,339
Yeon has become...

302
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,039
precious to me as well.

303
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:14,650
Let's go.

304
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,819
- We'll be late.
- Okay.

305
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,890
Coming!

306
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,900
Where are you off to today?

307
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,670
Me? To work.

308
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:51,180
This place of work you implied.
Is it perhaps my place of work?

309
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,289
Yes, of course.

310
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,089
You need a pass to enter
a broadcasting station.

311
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,289
I'm a nine-tailed fox.
Who could get in my way?

312
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,360
I'll take care of it.

313
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:02,630
What's with the suit though?

314
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,930
It's so that I can
blend in at the office.

315
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,470
- Don't you like it?
- That's not why I mentioned it.

316
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,440
Only the executives
wear neckties, you see.

317
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,140
Really?

318
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:16,039
Can you at least discard that?

319
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,380
No, I'll pretend to be
an executive instead.

320
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,549
- Good morning, sir.
- Keep up the good work, everyone.

321
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,860
What on earth? Did you
just hypnotize them?

322
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,930
Yes.

323
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,559
Why take on a role
as a director though?

324
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,630
In TV shows,

325
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,660
that's the position held by
those handsome and wealthy.

326
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,370
So? What will you do
next as a director?

327
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,910
I'll wait for you right here.

328
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,269
Here? All day?

329
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:49,710
When it comes to waiting,
no one can do it better.

330
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,009
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

331
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,279
- Here.
- Right.

332
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,029
Have a good day.

333
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:15,799
Call me if anything happens.

334
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,600
Got it.

335
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,579
Thanks, Yeon, for
being here for me.

336
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,860
If you get involved,
either one of you...

337
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:40,829
must die in the end.

338
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,329
That's become fate for
both you and her...

339
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,970
the moment that
thing was born again.

340
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:50,470
This could very well be
the last life I live.

341
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,380
I guess it could be worse.

342
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,660
Darn, I forgot to
remove the nails.

343
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:28,339
Hello, I'm the babysitter
who starts today.

344
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:34,009
All I ask you is
to feed him well.

345
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:40,920
Today is the day.

346
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,019
Today, the Imoogi
will be fully grown...

347
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,559
with a new face and body.

348
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,509
A man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

349
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,779
He told me about the accident
that would occur on that day...

350
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,380
at Yeou Gogae.

351
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,450
Albeit faint,

352
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,720
signs of human branding was
present on his forehead.

353
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,360
"Seo" as in west and
"Gyeong" as in Seoul.

354
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,759
Branding the face
of a criminal...

355
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,930
was the most brutal punishment
that involved bodily harm.

356
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,499
A branded criminal was
hated and looked down on...

357
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,640
and couldn't live
among others anymore.

358
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,180
And "Seogyeong" is the
old word for Pyongyang.

359
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,283
<font color="#00ff00">SEOGYEONG</font>

360
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,210
Why Seogyeong though?

361
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,950
<font color="#00ff00">SEOGYEONG, HUMAN BRANDING</font>

362
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,420
"Those who lead the
Revolt of Myocheong,"

363
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,620
"the uprising
which aimed for..."

364
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,729
"the transfer of the
capital to Seogyeong,"

365
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,829
"were sent into exile
after being branded."

366
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,660
"Revolt of Myocheong."

367
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:58,729
"Those who destroyed..."

368
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:00,200
"the order of the land
with their prophecies..."

369
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,499
"had these words branded
on their foreheads."

370
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,670
"Seogyeong or
Seogyeong Traitor."

371
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,279
Darn it. You committed treason.

372
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:34,470
Because the parents weren't
the targets of the accident.

373
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:36,769
The daughter was
the initial target.

374
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,450
Where are you?

375
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:49,880
Right on his tail.

376
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,120
It seems he has
someplace urgent to be.

377
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,729
- On his own?
- Yes, he's alone.

378
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,400
Keep an eye on
what Rang is up to.

379
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm to look for a man...

380
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,499
with his crime branded
on his forehead.

381
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,440
He's in league with Imoogi.

382
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:14,640
That's right. I'm sure that
Rang is connected to it too.

383
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,580
Darn it!

384
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:26,820
Did he drop his
wallet or something?

385
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:40,030
Find the glasses.

386
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,330
Do whatever you need
to do to find them.

387
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:44,530
Glasses?

388
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,270
Who is he on the phone with?

389
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:51,310
- Good morning.
- Morning.

390
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,240
- She's here.
- Begin the interrogation.

391
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,649
Time out. Jae Hwan, let
me see your forehead.

392
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,449
What? Why?

393
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,720
It's nothing.

394
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,389
Who's that guy?

395
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,020
- Who is he?
- Your boyfriend?

396
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,629
- I bet he's a source.
- How much did you each bet?

397
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,399
- 50 dollars.
- Now tell us what he is to you.

398
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:16,429
What could he be to me?

399
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:18,199
I'm just as curious too.

400
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,470
- What do you mean?
- Whenever that's the case,

401
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,879
feel that person's pulse.

402
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,909
- What?
- The body's reaction never lies.

403
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:33,849
Why is his heart
beating so fast?

404
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,689
Maybe his body's reaction
isn't always honest.

405
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:39,520
Have you two held hands?

406
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:42,990
Not the hands but...

407
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,000
You didn't hold hands, but
you did something else?

408
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,169
What part of him
did you grab then?

409
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
Do we have a story
for the next show?

410
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,909
My gosh, it's as if I came across
a rare item in a video game.

411
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,050
What? What is it?

412
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,679
I just want a good
look at your forehead.

413
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,449
I know who took your glasses.

414
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:18,520
- Who is it?
- Some kid.

415
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,459
A kid?

416
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:26,429
I guess you were
pretty drunk yesterday.

417
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,169
I don't have a family.

418
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,070
But there's someone who
rescued me from the zoo though.

419
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,139
So he's your savior.

420
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,310
Of course. He ripped the
zookeeper into pieces.

421
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,540
He's someone you'll be
meeting pretty soon.

422
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,430
I'll be off now.

423
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,669
Did you think I wouldn't know?

424
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,990
Make sure you're all
free for dinner tonight.

425
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,859
The president
invited us to dinner.

426
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,390
What is he going to buy for us?

427
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,760
We got invited to his house.

428
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,970
His house? That's going
to be so uncomfortable.

429
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,229
Why would you think
of it that way?

430
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,570
He normally only invites
his close acquaintances.

431
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,609
But this time, he invited us.
You know what this means, right?

432
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:18,780
You know, right?

433
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:23,249
Anyway... Forget it. Let's
just all eat chicken soup.

434
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,350
What's all this?

435
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:31,450
What... I think
there's been a mistake.

436
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,689
We were just about to
order chicken soup.

437
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:36,390
Eat up. It's on the house.

438
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:38,189
- On the house?
- On the house?

439
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,200
Why are you suddenly
giving us free food?

440
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,570
I was told that a very
special guest is here.

441
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,640
I did bring 80 percent
of all the employees...

442
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,879
at our broadcasting company
if you think about it.

443
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:55,950
I may be a VIP customer,
but this is way too much.

444
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,280
You could go broke, you know.

445
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,780
Do you lack magnesium?

446
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:03,320
Why do you keep
twitching your eye?

447
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,059
Enjoy.

448
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,959
Every ingredient that's used
to cook traditional food...

449
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,499
has a special story behind them.

450
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,200
Yes, just like the chef here.

451
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:20,570
Doesn't she speak so eloquently?

452
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,700
Let's eat.

453
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,340
You're able to receive this
kind of special treatment...

454
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,539
because I'm your boss.

455
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:27,579
You little minions.

456
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,979
What do you keep staring at?

457
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,490
What?

458
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,890
It's nothing.

459
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,959
That guy...

460
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
It's him, isn't he?

461
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:52,039
Yes, it's him. You sneaky brat.

462
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,499
Come here and join us.

463
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:01,640
Me?

464
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,350
Seoul is a small city, isn't it?

465
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,280
We all met here by coincidence.

466
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
It's not a coincidence.

467
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:10,789
Then why were you here?

468
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,720
Because of Ms. Nam.

469
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,459
What's going on
between you guys?

470
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,030
Jae Hwan.

471
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,160
I have feelings for her
although she doesn't.

472
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,260
A one-sided love?

473
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,570
What a waste of
that handsome face.

474
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,370
He has feelings for
me, and so do I.

475
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,189
Why did you follow me?

476
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,189
Why did Yeon have you follow me?

477
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,200
Listen.

478
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,070
Do you still think I'm a little
kid who used to follow Yeon around?

479
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,570
I know you're not.

480
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,109
I also know that
you can kill me...

481
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,840
without leaving a single trace.

482
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,950
Then tell me why
you followed me.

483
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,850
You...

484
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,189
should know that
better than anyone.

485
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,120
Do you think we're
playing 20 questions?

486
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,559
All my life, I've
lived for Yeon.

487
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:26,430
And I was able to
live thanks to him.

488
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,559
That means I can't
do anything...

489
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,240
to cause him any harm even if
that could cost me my life.

490
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:48,249
Are you being loyal
or sympathetic?

491
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,590
Or are you just dumb?

492
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,559
It's the same reason...

493
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,959
why you're so obsessed about
hurting your older brother.

494
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,359
It's because we both like him.

495
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:09,740
I'm sorry if this is out of
line, but what do you do?

496
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,939
- What's your job?
- I don't have a job.

497
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,510
I knew it.

498
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,649
You have lots of time
but no job experience.

499
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:19,050
That's explains why
you've fallen for Ji A.

500
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,289
Can I break his ribs?

501
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:27,220
No, you can't. Hold your anger.

502
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,260
But seriously, do you
really not have a job?

503
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,200
- He gets paid rent.
- You own a building?

504
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,870
He owns 30 million dollars'
worth of real estate.

505
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,999
I do?

506
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:45,309
By any chance, do you
have any brothers?

507
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,879
- I do have a little brother.
- Then we can be in-laws.

508
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,450
How old are you?

509
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,590
I'm not that young.

510
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,859
- I'm a thousand...
- He's older than he looks.

511
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:04,189
- Have you done it once?
- Done what once?

512
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:06,930
He's asking if you're also
divorced just like him.

513
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,570
Is he the guy who got divorced
in less than a year...

514
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Yes.

515
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:13,840
I guess you know him.

516
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,609
He's never been married before.

517
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,209
He's like a guy you'd
see in a fantasy drama.

518
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,820
What's up with him?

519
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,919
That's his ritual.
He always does that.

520
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,350
Is it good?

521
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:33,090
Look. This is nice.

522
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,289
- Just eat it.
- By the way...

523
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,769
I need to go somewhere.

524
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

525
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,859
You're pretty.

526
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:08,720
You think I'm pretty?

527
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,390
Kids these days
have bad eyesight...

528
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,990
because they're always
on their smartphones.

529
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,229
- A eunuch.
- What?

530
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,729
What's a eunuch?

531
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,439
- It's really sad to explain...
- I'm not a eunuch.

532
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,609
- Do you want me to prove it?
- What are you doing with a kid?

533
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,169
He called me a eunuch.

534
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,280
Kids don't know how to lie.

535
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,680
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

536
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:38,689
I'm scared.

537
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,820
- What?
- Your face...

538
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,459
It's so scary.

539
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:55,370
Does that mean I have a
really bad first impression?

540
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,340
Yes. I heard kids
don't know how to lie.

541
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:04,050
Hey, you're here.

542
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,120
- Where is Shin Ju?
- He's still alive.

543
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,550
Don't take it out on him.

544
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,720
If you have something to say,
just talk to me directly.

545
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:14,660
You must care for him a lot.

546
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:17,329
I care for him a lot more
than my little brother...

547
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,030
who's still going through puberty
ever since the Joseon Dynasty.

548
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,430
Why did you put a tail on me?

549
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,269
I guess we're both not the
type to beat around the bush.

550
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:32,809
Why did it have to be an Imoogi?

551
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,579
You finally found out?

552
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,309
There are many other
ways to harm me.

553
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,749
So why did it have to be that?

554
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:43,320
I figured it'd be interesting
to reenact your past.

555
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,850
As you know, I'm an aesthete.

556
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,189
Does he have something on you?

557
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
I guess he does.

558
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,660
We both give and take, so
I'd call it a contract.

559
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,530
Listen to me carefully.

560
00:42:58,169 --> 00:43:01,939
Sometimes, there are people you
should never make deals with.

561
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:03,209
I need to make a living.

562
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,539
It's not too late to stop.

563
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:08,780
If you don't stop now,
it'll come at a price.

564
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,050
Let me ask you something.

565
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:14,749
What if I was the one in danger?

566
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
What if my life was at stake?

567
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,720
Would you have
come to rescue me?

568
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,760
Save yourself.

569
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:32,370
You seem to be enjoying
yourself with your first love.

570
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,640
But if she knew everything...

571
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,870
that happened in her past life,
would she still stay with you?

572
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,280
If you touch her,

573
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,879
I'll really kill you this time.

574
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,059
Mr. Lee. I've located the kid.

575
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,629
Fine,

576
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,829
I'll let you kill me.

577
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,410
Give me Shin Ju.

578
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:17,809
You owe me for his life.

579
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:39,939
Mr. Lee.

580
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,180
Give me the glasses.

581
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:52,919
No. They're my magic glasses.

582
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:11,300
I won't go easy on you
just because you're a kid.

583
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,309
Stop it. I hate
hearing people cry.

584
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,350
If it were in the past,
I would've killed you.

585
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,620
I'm only going easy on you
because of the low birth rate.

586
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,140
No.

587
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,140
It can't be.

588
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:56,950
Geomdoong?

589
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,109
Yay! I'm so excited!

590
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,320
Faster!

591
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,120
Geomdoong...

592
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:20,470
I won't give my heart to
something like that again.

593
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,300
Never again...

594
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:42,890
Why did you follow me?

595
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:44,930
Are you Spiderman?

596
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,829
You moved all quickly
and stuff like Spiderman.

597
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:50,970
You're annoying to look at.

598
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,399
Then why did you buy me
yummy chocolate pastries?

599
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm just paying a debt.

600
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,039
I'm saying, "Eat
this, and get lost."

601
00:46:58,109 --> 00:46:59,209
A pet?

602
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:00,879
To brush their hair?

603
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:03,209
He looks dumb too.

604
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,220
Why did he have to be born as
a human being of all things?

605
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:34,379
Let's enter the castle.

606
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,240
Ms. Nam. Come quickly.

607
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,010
Hurry.

608
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,169
- Okay.
- Hurry.

609
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,010
There's a second floor too.

610
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,850
I wonder what something
like this costs.

611
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:14,519
Why? So you can buy one?

612
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:17,990
It's not bad, but it's too
far from the train station.

613
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,419
Whatever.

614
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,459
I've never seen ground
cherries in Seoul before.

615
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,570
Are these ground cherries?

616
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,300
They look like lanterns.

617
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:35,700
I used to scoop out the inside
and blow on it like a recorder.

618
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:38,309
- Does this make sounds too?
- Of course.

619
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,439
My mom said it was bad luck,
that it would bring out a snake.

620
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:43,749
My gosh.

621
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,919
Don't touch that.

622
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,590
- It holds a special meaning for me.
- I see. I'm sorry.

623
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:59,660
I have only two
rules in this house.

624
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,260
One. Don't touch
the ground cherries.

625
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,200
- You can't blow on it either.
- It'll bring out a snake.

626
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:08,470
Second. You cannot go
up to the second floor.

627
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,109
Is someone there?

628
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:11,570
No, I live alone.

629
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,709
And the caterer.

630
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:18,550
Anyway, he says not to
go up there, so don't.

631
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,680
You must be hungry.

632
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,550
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

633
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,959
Water.

634
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,459
What?

635
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:29,990
- Water.
- Water.

636
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:38,229
Here.

637
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,499
- The cap.
- The cap.

638
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,209
You want me to feed you?

639
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,379
I'm injured.

640
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:55,579
Okay, fine.

641
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:08,100
- Where's Ms. Nam?
- She has dinner plans.

642
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:09,800
You don't need to go?

643
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,700
She went with colleagues.
She said she'll see me later.

644
00:50:16,209 --> 00:50:18,240
Where's the chicken?

645
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,809
That's right. Chicken.

646
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:23,079
It's on its way.

647
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,050
- One whole chicken.
- Garlic drumsticks.

648
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:30,519
- Did you order original?
- Yes.

649
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,760
Seriously...

650
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,260
I'll let it slide since
that tastes good too.

651
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,999
Feed the dog before
the chicken comes.

652
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,059
Okay.

653
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,629
Anyway...

654
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:47,070
Are you really in pain?

655
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,939
Are you overreacting so that
you can order me around?

656
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:51,140
I'm hurt physically...

657
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,479
and emotionally.

658
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,709
See? What did I tell you?

659
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:59,010
I said that necklace
thief was suspicious.

660
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:00,649
Stop calling her a thief.

661
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:02,620
She has a nice name. Yu Ri.

662
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,859
Whatever her name is, she used
you because Rang put her up to it.

663
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,160
We had a bad start,
that's all. We're a 99.

664
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,459
What? What's 99?

665
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,660
Look.

666
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,669
It's a marital compatibility
test using names.

667
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,639
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

668
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,740
<font color="#00ff00">NAM, LEE, JI, YEON, A</font>

669
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,950
"Nam Ji A and Lee
Yeon." What? 25?

670
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:33,120
My back. My head.
My legs. My heart.

671
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:35,820
I'm going to redo
this. You did it wrong.

672
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,689
Okay, let's make a toast.

673
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:43,859
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

674
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,930
I hope you'll continue
to dominate in ratings...

675
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,760
and stay on air
for years to come.

676
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:48,930
We can do it.

677
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:50,470
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

678
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,939
- Tell me...
- When we went for the shoot,

679
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:58,010
I packed a cross, a rosary, a
talisman, everything there is.

680
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,180
And a case of medicine
to calm his nerves.

681
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,609
I'm sure he was prepared.
Although he was prepared,

682
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,479
the camera was
rattling in his hands.

683
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:07,519
Ji A almost murdered him.

684
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:08,850
That's when I realized...

685
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,289
that people can be
scarier than ghosts.

686
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:14,059
Ji A has guts.

687
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:17,329
I recognized it during her interview
and made sure she stayed with us.

688
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,559
I remember. You said,

689
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:22,260
"You have to join
us no matter what."

690
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,169
I remember something too.

691
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:26,470
When we went to the workshop,

692
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,370
we were in the retreat
center, and the mic broke.

693
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:32,539
- So...
- Did you go to a workshop with me?

694
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,109
Yes, sir.

695
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,550
Anyway, do you believe in
ghosts and the supernatural?

696
00:52:42,649 --> 00:52:45,850
A long time ago, I almost died.

697
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,689
It was a miracle
that I survived.

698
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:51,760
What I met that
day wasn't human.

699
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,430
Then what was it?

700
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,329
I said it was a miracle.

701
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,800
Gosh.

702
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:08,680
- Where's the bathroom?
- Go straight down the hall.

703
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,079
I'll be right back.

704
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,280
Sir. So...

705
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,249
You went with me to
the awards ceremony...

706
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:27,999
Is there someone upstairs?

707
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:40,539
Maybe I heard wrong.

708
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,490
I shouldn't be snooping
around someone else's home.

709
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:15,539
An artificial nail?

710
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,300
I must've been born
to drink champagne.

711
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,200
- Gosh.
- Stop him.

712
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,269
- Sir, I think you had enough.
- How dare you.

713
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:49,039
Champagne doesn't even
qualify as alcohol.

714
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,539
Shouldn't Ji A be back by now?

715
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,780
- Why don't I look for her?
- No, the guest should stay seated.

716
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,280
We'll be here waiting, sir.

717
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,999
Welcome.

718
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:24,574
- Hey.
- What time will the dinner be over?

719
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,184
In about 30 minutes, I think.

720
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:29,414
- Are you still at the vet?
- Yes.

721
00:57:29,954 --> 00:57:31,653
Tell me the address
and I'll pick you up.

722
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:35,684
It's fine. The others and
I will take a cab together.

723
00:57:36,184 --> 00:57:38,354
All right. I'll see
you at home then.

724
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:39,824
See you in a bit.

725
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:46,764
Sir...

726
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,604
I told you that the second
floor was off limits.

727
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:50,874
Sorry about that.

728
00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:54,173
Is there someone
in the room though?

729
00:57:55,043 --> 00:57:56,874
I hear sounds coming from it.

730
00:57:56,943 --> 00:57:59,043
It must be the wind. The
window was left open.

731
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:02,713
Let's grab some dessert then.

732
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:03,883
Sure.

733
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:37,684
Why are you crying?

734
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:42,624
Because it's been so long
since you've looked this happy.

735
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:50,264
Right.

736
00:58:50,863 --> 00:58:52,334
Well, enjoy it while it lasts...

737
00:58:52,764 --> 00:58:55,264
and have this be the
look you remember me by.

738
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:58,334
You're talking like
someone who's leaving.

739
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,934
As if that would happen.

740
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:02,673
Please live a long life...

741
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:07,843
and enjoy the happiest of
times while Ms. Nam lives hers.

742
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:14,584
Ji A, I'm glad you're
here. Are ghosts evil?

743
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:16,624
Is that why you hunt after them?

744
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,354
If that's the case,
they should be arrested.

745
00:59:20,063 --> 00:59:21,324
Sir, let me tell you this.

746
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,463
I believe we are a community.

747
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:27,304
It doesn't matter if they
are supernatural beings.

748
00:59:27,304 --> 00:59:31,003
When we actually encounter them,

749
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:33,974
we should thank them...

750
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:36,813
for helping us earn a
living and beg for them...

751
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,914
to keep the antics up.

752
00:59:48,724 --> 00:59:50,593
You found this at his house?

753
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:52,923
- Yes.
- It gives me the creeps.

754
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:56,063
It's a glue-on artificial nail
with cheap embellishments.

755
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:57,133
Who could it belong to?

756
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,233
It's neither yours or mine...

757
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:01,503
and none of the catering
staff had fake nails either.

758
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:04,304
Also, his wife passed
away over a decade ago.

759
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:08,273
Why don't you ask if
he's dating anyone?

760
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:09,474
Directly?

761
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,914
How can you get by in life
with a mindset like that?

762
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:17,514
It'll make more sense to
think that he has a hobby.

763
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,684
Doing nail art?

764
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:20,753
As if that would make sense.

765
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,693
Your rice is ready.

766
01:00:41,673 --> 01:00:42,673
You're home.

767
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:47,813
Did you make dinner?
I already ate.

768
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:50,954
I know that, but you said
you like freshly cooked rice.

769
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:52,954
I may not be a good cook,

770
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:55,454
but I can make the
best steamed rice.

771
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:01,224
So this is how it feels
to come home after work...

772
01:01:01,523 --> 01:01:02,624
to the smell of
freshly cooked rice.

773
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:05,733
I'll make sure you do
every day I'm here.

774
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:09,604
Here.

775
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:11,574
What's this?

776
01:01:12,074 --> 01:01:13,133
I picked it up on the street.

777
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,374
- Mint chocolate flavor?
- I'll go and change.

778
01:01:25,454 --> 01:01:27,523
For a second, I thought
she was handing me trash.

779
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,894
What do you normally
do at night?

780
01:01:40,804 --> 01:01:41,834
Watching American
TV shows, was it?

781
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:45,233
I also read and watch the news.

782
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:48,644
I usually watch movies.

783
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:50,943
Should we watch one?

784
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:53,883
Shall we?

785
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:56,343
- What's this?
- What...

786
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:14,764
Hey. Did you see that just now?

787
01:02:15,104 --> 01:02:16,604
I can't believe it.

788
01:02:16,604 --> 01:02:19,003
What I read online was true.

789
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:20,503
Let me see.

790
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:21,974
- My gosh.
- Is it on?

791
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:24,273
Try this.

792
01:02:35,653 --> 01:02:38,354
What's wrong? Are you
not enjoying the movie?

793
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:42,624
I'm enjoying it.

794
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:48,264
I'm enjoying it so much
that I wish time would stop.

795
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:54,943
Me too.

796
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,773
For me, it's the smell
of freshly cooked rice.

797
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:00,943
New sneakers.

798
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:35,843
Put them on, and look at
yourself in the mirror.

01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:39,074
It'll give you the
answer to your question.

800
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:51,894
New sneakers.

801
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:55,293
What kind of shoes
do women like?

802
01:05:06,733 --> 01:05:07,903
Excuse me, can you...

803
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,244
My gosh.

804
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,673
My goodness.

805
01:05:16,514 --> 01:05:19,753
- What do you want?
- I sent a gift to your lady.

806
01:05:20,724 --> 01:05:22,724
Have you heard of the
eyebrows of a tiger?

810
01:06:15,443 --> 01:06:16,843
Gosh, how lame.

811
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:18,713
My gosh.

812
01:06:58,454 --> 01:07:01,084
She means nothing to me.

813
01:07:01,324 --> 01:07:04,824
Don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

814
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:06,353
Yeon.

815
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:41,124
Did you see it?

816
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,664
Tell me. Did you see it?

817
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:57,473
Please look at me.

818
01:08:09,254 --> 01:08:10,384
What...

819
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,563
did you see?

820
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:16,994
I was...

821
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:20,363
murdered in my past life.

822
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:26,174
You...

823
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:29,574
killed me.

824
01:08:32,244 --> 01:08:33,443
Your sole purpose...

825
01:08:34,914 --> 01:08:36,884
was to find the Imoogi.

826
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:40,723
Yeon.

827
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,353
You used me...

828
01:08:48,594 --> 01:08:50,294
to offer as sacrifice.

<i>If I ever get to be born again,</i>

831
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:38,473
<i>I want to live as a human being.</i>

832
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,084
<i>I'm not going to be
easy on you anymore.</i>

833
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,544
<i>Where is the Imoogi?</i>

834
01:09:43,683 --> 01:09:47,523
<i>You were born to be
offered to me as sacrifice.</i>

835
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:49,183
<i>She's going to be my wife.</i>

836

<i>What do you fear the most?</i>

837
01:09:51,594 --> 01:09:53,153
<i>Yeou Gogae.</i>

838
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:56,464
<i>I'm willing to do anything now.</i>

839
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,393
<i>Mom!</i>

840
01:09:58,634 --> 01:10:01,164
<i>Please hang in there
just a bit longer.</i>
