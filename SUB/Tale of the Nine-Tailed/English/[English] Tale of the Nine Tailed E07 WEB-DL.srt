1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,759
Hi.

2
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,470
What exited the well...

3
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,799
went into hiding immediately.

4
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,670
A piece of it was
found recently though.

5
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,640
A piece of it?

6
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,679
It can't be.

7
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,480
On her body.

8
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,420
She has lost the fox
bead you gave her.

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,120
In consequence, something
within her awoke.

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
What?

11
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,050
Why there...

12
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,319
of all places...

13
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,189
when it took her 600 years...

14
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,229
to finally be reborn?

15
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,500
All she wants...

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,340
is to live her life out...

17
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,470
as normally as possible
with her family.

18
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,870
So why...

19
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,210
Why is it within her?

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,720
That's her destiny.

21
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,590
Her destiny?

22
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,650
Says who?

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,759
What did she do to deserve this?

24
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,889
Do you dare to question
the higher powers...

25
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,000
at a place of the Almighty?

26
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,500
You already knew, didn't you?

27
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,500
It's why you constantly
told me to forget about her.

28
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,539
Right now,

29
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,740
I feel like I've
been betrayed...

30
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,009
by a bank I trusted
my money with.

31
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,109
So?

32
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,550
I'll need a compensation.

33
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,280
I took you in and helped you
when you had absolutely nothing.

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,819
How dare you have the guts to
think that I owe you something?

35
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,099
Enough!

36
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:26,809
Relax, Yeon.

37
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,780
You too, honey.

38
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,349
Listen to me carefully.

39
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,090
If I find out that Ji A
will end up dying early,

40
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,320
I'll make a mess of the
Living Realm and Afterlife.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,159
I don't even want to
look at you. Leave.

42
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,059
Did you see it?

43
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,369
I'm curious to
know how you feel.

44
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,039
I feel like I might cry.

45
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,109
I had to wait such
a long time...

46
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,780
to finally meet that person.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,150
You have a lot on your mind.

48
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,059
- Pardon?
- You think I'm peculiar.

49
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,760
Am I no longer the
Imoogi you once knew?

50
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:19,460
If I've changed, that's
because the world has changed.

51
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,900
Imoogis and nine-tailed foxes
exist in a rapidly changing world.

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,369
There's no need to see the
world in an old-fashioned way.

53
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,710
Now, they will start
looking for us.

54
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,140
That's what I've
been waiting for.

55
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,249
I really can't wait
to meet that person.

56
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,720
She was pretty harsh, but
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

57
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,630
She's very cold-hearted,
but she cared for you...

58
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
like her own son.

59
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,070
Don't console me.

60
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,099
I'm already pretty
close to crying.

61
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,809
Yeon, don't get
swept up in this.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,239
Just act like you
don't know anything.

63
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,150
Don't jump into fire when
you know it's dangerous.

64
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,249
But she'll be hurt
if I don't go.

65
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,419
You don't want...

66
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,749
to see the tragedy on replay.

67
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,289
If you get involved,
either one of you...

68
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,299
must die in the end.

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,970
That's become fate for
both you and her...

70
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,940
the moment that
thing was born again.

71
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,609
No, Ji A won't die. Never.

72
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,780
I made a promise.

73
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,890
I promised to help her live
a proper life this time.

74
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,289
I'll protect her even
if it ends my life.

75
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:13,609
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 7: THE TRAP OF SAMSARA</font>

76
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:29,090
There are more moments when a child
needs her parents than I thought.

77
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,929
For example, when the
child takes her first step.

78
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,429
Who else would be that
moved that you got up...

79
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,169
and took just a few
steps by yourself?

80
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:40,700
When I was the only one at a
picnic without a homemade lunch.

81
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,140
When the kid I fought
with in class said,

82
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,280
"I'm going to tell
my mom on you."

83
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,809
I couldn't beat kids with moms.

84
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,320
If only they were mean though.

85
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:54,950
If they were, I
might've been able...

86
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,390
to forget about them and
move on with my life.

87
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,359
Why have you been searching
for your parents all this time?

88
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,630
It's simple.

89
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,030
I miss them, that's all.

90
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,109
The fox bead?

91
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,780
I didn't know it
was that important.

92
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,149
You gave it to that
fortune-teller, didn't you?

93
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:31,859
He suddenly started talking
to me about my fate...

94
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,960
and promised to let you
go if I gave him that.

95
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,160
But still, how could you...

96
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,859
give it to him so easily
like a piece of candy?

97
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,899
Because I couldn't
afford to lose you.

98
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,479
I'm going to stay
here for a while.

99
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,810
You're going to stay?

100
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,149
At my house?

101
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,619
- You're going to live here?
- Yes.

102
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,519
I've never seen a nine-tailed
fox with such an open-mind.

103
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,090
Then do you want to
come to my place?

104
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,389
That's not what I meant.
Why all of a sudden?

105
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,119
It's the least I can
do for your safety.

106
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,430
Don't make me risk
my life to save you.

107
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,739
I was going to ask if you're
okay sleeping on the sofa.

108
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,450
You're using your
life to negotiate,

109
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,979
so it's hard to refuse.

110
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,019
Why are you up? I left
after I saw you fall asleep.

111
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,960
I had a bad dream.

112
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,859
- You had a dream?
- I saw a little boy.

113
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,560
And he said "Hi" to me.

114
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,599
- And then?
- That's it.

115
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:54,410
At first, it totally
creeped me out.

116
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,139
But after I woke up,

117
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,840
I felt pleasant to have
met him for some reason.

118
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:00,879
It felt like I knew
him or something.

119
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,830
Yes, he's the most precious
thing in your life.

120
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,259
Your brother.

121
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,739
I'll have a cola.

122
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,440
Why cola?

123
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,080
Last time, I got drunk and ate
the pigeons in my neighborhood.

124
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,249
I've been trying not
to drink after that.

125
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,450
I had enteritis.

126
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,849
Were you the one who
left a dead pigeon...

127
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:39,879
in front of my front door?

128
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,950
I went all the way there?

129
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,359
I don't remember.

130
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,359
What are you? A stray cat?

131
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,090
Did you fail to find what
you were looking for?

132
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,139
These glasses are the
eyebrows of a tiger?

133
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:01,340
So if I wear this, I can
see people's past lives?

134
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,479
Why do you look so sad?

135
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,979
- I'm not sad. I'm angry.
- Why?

136
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:12,519
I'm angry that I still have
the emotions of a human being.

137
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,550
Maybe it's because
I'm a half-blood.

138
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,060
Yes, you told me your
mother was human.

139
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,989
Did she hold you and
carry you on her back?

140
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,700
Did she catch chickens for you
and feed you all the nice parts?

141
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,930
You're making the
alcohol taste bad.

142
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,540
I just want to know how
it feels to be loved.

143
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,570
"Love"?

144
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:52,720
Mom.

145
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,769
Wait here for a moment.

146
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,180
No, I'm scared.

147
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,849
I'll be right back after
I gather hazelnuts.

148
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:18,149
Let me go with you. I
want to go with you.

149
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,019
Why do you give me
such a hard time?

150
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,690
I haven't given up on my
life just because of you.

151
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,349
Do you want the both
of us to just die?

152
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,479
Mom?

153
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,590
Love...

154
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,989
can get you killed.

155
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,259
The one who loves the other
person more becomes the prey.

156
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,300
I don't want that. I'd
rather be the predator.

157
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,239
Is it Shin Ju?

158
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,739
What has he done to sway you?

159
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,979
I'm surprised to hear
you talk about love.

160
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,519
I won't get swayed.

161
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,479
No matter what happens,

162
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,019
your enemies will
always be my enemies.

163
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:32,389
You should go.

164
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,119
I want to be alone.

165
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,139
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

166
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,479
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

167
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,379
We got a 99.

168
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,590
Mr. Lee and Ms.
Nam only got a 25.

169
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,759
See that?

170
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
According to the scientific
law of probabilities,

171
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,399
there is definitely
something there. Yes.

172
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,229
Even if she is from another country
that doesn't know Confucianism,

173
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,769
she kissed me on the cheek
when we first met, and...

174
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:25,540
What are you saying?

175
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,210
Why should I get neutered?

176
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,950
What, do you mean, I'm in
heat? Watch your mouth.

177
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:33,920
Anyway, your mom...

178
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,349
pretended she didn't like it, but
she finished the chicken soup.

179
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,259
She speaks meanly, but
she isn't a bad person.

180
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,460
You know that, right?

181
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,160
What? You want chicken soup?

182
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,430
You had your dog food
just half an hour ago.

183
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
You don't remember?

184
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,599
You're driving me crazy.

185
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Hey!

186
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,090
How long will you stand there?

187
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,019
- All night long.
- All night?

188
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,830
Don't mind me.

189
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,460
You're standing right
there, staring at me.

190
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,960
How could I not mind you?

191
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,430
Should I watch
from outside then?

192
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,739
That's out of a horror film.

193
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:30,970
You don't like this, you don't like
that. How can I protect you then?

194
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,509
Sleep on the couch.

195
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,749
No. It's outside of
the monitoring radius.

196
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,009
- Then sleep here.
- Okay.

197
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,119
I meant in the
room, not in my bed.

198
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,090
As I told you before, I'm modern.
I need a bed in order to sleep.

199
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,359
You can sleep on the
floor if you're afraid.

200
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,759
I'm not afraid.

201
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,749
Aren't you going to sleep?

202
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,249
I can't fall asleep.

203
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,190
My dad taught me
this a long time ago.

204
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:21,930
If you can't fall asleep,

205
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,430
imagine something that makes you
happy just thinking about it.

206
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,029
Like mint chocolate
chip ice cream?

207
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
For me, it's the smell
of freshly cooked rice.

208
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,550
The sound of a pencil
being sharpened.

209
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,220
New sneakers.

210
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,590
Pro baseball season.

211
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,430
A complete set of
world literature.

212
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,029
A puppy's toe beans.

213
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,200
Dad's handmade gimbap.

214
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,900
Something no one writes anymore.

215
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,309
A letter.

216
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,150
Your turn.

217
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,150
Are you asleep?

218
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,249
What? For me...

219
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,019
Red umbrella.

220
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,559
No!

221
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,870
What was that about?

222
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,370
Why are you smiling?

223
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,170
Wasn't I cool just now?

224
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,339
I moved quickly like
Spiderman, and...

225
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,479
The type I hate the most.

226
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,920
And his nose is running.

227
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,559
Mister. Do you like Spiderman?

228
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,259
- No.
- Why not?

229
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,460
- I just don't.
- I like him.

230
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,930
I don't care at all.

231
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,670
Stop talking to me.

232
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,870
I'm in a bad mood already
without your help.

233
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,170
I woke up at 4:30...

234
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,039
It's almost done. Almost done.

235
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,940
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

236
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,249
- Dried pollack soup?
- That's right.

237
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,410
Did you burn this?

238
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,779
You are impressive.

239
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,220
It's not burned. It's...
What do you call it?

240
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,690
I'm making dried
pollack soup, but...

241
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,759
Go buy more pollack.
I used it all up.

242
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,789
All of it?

243
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,299
I added sugar by mistake.

244
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,529
I'll do it. Step aside.

245
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,769
Hi.

246
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,710
Hey. Did you sleep well?

247
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:31,410
Yes.

248
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,039
Let's have breakfast.

249
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,950
Dried pollack soup is
the best for hangovers.

250
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,850
Did you make all of
this by yourself?

251
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,779
That isn't important.

252
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,019
- It's the thought that counts.
- That's awesome.

253
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,489
- Good morning, Ms. Nam!
- Oh, my gosh.

254
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,069
Why are you coming from there?

255
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,940
I heard you moved in together.

256
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,710
I had to bring Mr. Lee
fresh clothes anyway, so...

257
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,110
Where's the bleach?

258
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,309
Bleach? Why?

259
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,180
The hard water stains on
the sink are terrible.

260
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,710
I scrubbed the tiles with
baking soda and vinegar.

261
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,049
I have to clear the drain
of all the hair too. Also!

262
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,190
Don't let delivery food pile up
in the fridge. They're all germs.

263
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,420
- She's like a mother-in-law.
- Gosh.

264
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,390
I don't want to meddle
with someone else's home,

265
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,059
but Mr. Lee has never done
a chore in his entire life.

266
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,130
And he has OCD to boot.

267
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:28,160
- What was that, you punk?
- Enjoy your breakfast.

268
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:29,569
Where's the bleach?

269
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,799
It's in the bathroom.
Under the sink.

270
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,739
He should just keep looking.
Why did he come out and...

271
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,670
Hold on.

272
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,180
- Did you burn this?
- Well, not "burn" per se.

273
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:49,450
It's more like I failed at
controlling the temperature.

274
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,630
Why are you cute in the
midst of all of this?

275
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:00,999
The dried pollack is
dominating my body.

276
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:03,329
Cute? I'm over 1,000 years old.

277
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,499
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's eat.

278
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,339
It's soft-boiled.

279
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:21,950
Eat up.

280
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,900
Yes?

281
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,769
Ma'am.

282
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,299
Come in.

283
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,870
Here.

284
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,110
- Thank you.
- Sure.

285
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,710
So... Ms. Nam.

286
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,479
I know it's not my place
to say this, but...

287
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,150
Please be safe.

288
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:57,089
If you get hurt, Mr. Lee...

289
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:00,819
He'll be hurt 2, 3...
No, 10 times worse.

290
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,630
Yeon's so lucky.

291
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:07,600
He has a friend who
worries so much about him.

292
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,499
He's very precious to me.

293
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,970
I promise.

294
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,610
I'll do my best to be safe.

295
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:18,839
Yeon has become...

296
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,539
precious to me as well.

297
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,150
Let's go.

298
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,319
- We'll be late.
- Okay.

299
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,390
Coming!

300
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,400
Where are you off to today?

301
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,170
Me? To work.

302
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:01,680
This place of work you implied.
Is it perhaps my place of work?

303
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,789
Yes, of course.

304
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,589
You need a pass to enter
a broadcasting station.

305
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,789
I'm a nine-tailed fox.
Who could get in my way?

306
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,860
I'll take care of it.

307
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,130
What's with the suit though?

308
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,430
It's so that I can
blend in at the office.

309
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:19,970
- Don't you like it?
- That's not why I mentioned it.

310
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:21,940
Only the executives
wear neckties, you see.

311
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:24,640
Really?

312
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,539
Can you at least discard that?

313
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,880
No, I'll pretend to be
an executive instead.

314
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,049
- Good morning, sir.
- Keep up the good work, everyone.

315
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,360
What on earth? Did you
just hypnotize them?

316
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,430
Yes.

317
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,059
Why take on a role
as a director though?

318
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,130
In TV shows,

319
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,160
that's the position held by
those handsome and wealthy.

320
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,870
So? What will you do
next as a director?

321
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,410
I'll wait for you right here.

322
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,769
Here? All day?

323
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,210
When it comes to waiting,
no one can do it better.

324
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,509
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

325
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,779
- Here.
- Right.

326
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,529
Have a good day.

327
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,299
Call me if anything happens.

328
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,100
Got it.

329
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,079
Thanks, Yeon, for
being here for me.

330
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,360
If you get involved,
either one of you...

331
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,329
must die in the end.

332
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,829
That's become fate for
both you and her...

333
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,470
the moment that
thing was born again.

334
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:00,970
This could very well be
the last life I live.

335
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:11,880
I guess it could be worse.

336
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,160
Darn, I forgot to
remove the nails.

337
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,839
Hello, I'm the babysitter
who starts today.

338
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:44,509
All I ask you is
to feed him well.

339
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,420
Today is the day.

340
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,519
Today, the Imoogi
will be fully grown...

341
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,059
with a new face and body.

342
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,009
A man in a navy blue
suit came to see me.

343
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,279
He told me about the accident
that would occur on that day...

344
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,880
at Yeou Gogae.

345
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,950
Albeit faint,

346
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,220
signs of human branding was
present on his forehead.

347
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,860
"Seo" as in west and
"Gyeong" as in Seoul.

348
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,259
Branding the face
of a criminal...

349
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,430
was the most brutal punishment
that involved bodily harm.

350
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,999
A branded criminal was
hated and looked down on...

351
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:40,140
and couldn't live
among others anymore.

352
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,680
And "Seogyeong" is the
old word for Pyongyang.

353
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,610
<font color="#00ff00">SEOGYEONG</font>

354
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,710
Why Seogyeong though?

355
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,450
<font color="#00ff00">SEOGYEONG, HUMAN BRANDING</font>

356
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,920
"Those who lead the
Revolt of Myocheong,"

357
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,120
"the uprising
which aimed for..."

358
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,229
"the transfer of the
capital to Seogyeong,"

359
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:05,329
"were sent into exile
after being branded."

360
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,160
"Revolt of Myocheong."

361
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,229
"Those who destroyed..."

362
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,700
"the order of the land
with their prophecies..."

363
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,999
"had these words branded
on their foreheads."

364
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,170
"Seogyeong or
Seogyeong Traitor."

365
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,779
Darn it. You committed treason.

366
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:44,970
Because the parents weren't
the targets of the accident.

367
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:47,269
The daughter was
the initial target.

368
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,950
Where are you?

369
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,380
Right on his tail.

370
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,620
It seems he has
someplace urgent to be.

371
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,229
- On his own?
- Yes, he's alone.

372
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,900
Keep an eye on
what Rang is up to.

373
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
I'm to look for a man...

374
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,999
with his crime branded
on his forehead.

375
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,940
He's in league with Imoogi.

376
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:25,140
That's right. I'm sure that
Rang is connected to it too.

377
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,080
Darn it!

378
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,320
Did he drop his
wallet or something?

379
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,530
Find the glasses.

380
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,830
Do whatever you need
to do to find them.

381
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:55,030
Glasses?

382
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,770
Who is he on the phone with?

383
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:01,810
- Good morning.
- Morning.

384
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,740
- She's here.
- Begin the interrogation.

385
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,149
Time out. Jae Hwan, let
me see your forehead.

386
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,949
What? Why?

387
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,220
It's nothing.

388
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,889
Who's that guy?

389
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,520
- Who is he?
- Your boyfriend?

390
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,129
- I bet he's a source.
- How much did you each bet?

391
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,899
- 50 dollars.
- Now tell us what he is to you.

392
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,929
What could he be to me?

393
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:28,699
I'm just as curious too.

394
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,970
- What do you mean?
- Whenever that's the case,

395
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,379
feel that person's pulse.

396
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:38,409
- What?
- The body's reaction never lies.

397
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,349
Why is his heart
beating so fast?

398
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:46,189
Maybe his body's reaction
isn't always honest.

399
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:50,020
Have you two held hands?

400
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,490
Not the hands but...

401
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,500
You didn't hold hands, but
you did something else?

402
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,669
What part of him
did you grab then?

403
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,740
Do we have a story
for the next show?

404
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,409
My gosh, it's as if I came across
a rare item in a video game.

405
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,550
What? What is it?

406
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,179
I just want a good
look at your forehead.

407
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,949
I know who took your glasses.

408
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:29,020
- Who is it?
- Some kid.

409
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,959
A kid?

410
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,929
I guess you were
pretty drunk yesterday.

411
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,669
I don't have a family.

412
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,570
But there's someone who
rescued me from the zoo though.

413
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,639
So he's your savior.

414
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,810
Of course. He ripped the
zookeeper into pieces.

415
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:49,040
He's someone you'll be
meeting pretty soon.

416
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:10,930
I'll be off now.

417
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:53,169
Did you think I wouldn't know?

418
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,490
Make sure you're all
free for dinner tonight.

419
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,359
The president
invited us to dinner.

420
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:14,890
What is he going to buy for us?

421
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,260
We got invited to his house.

422
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,470
His house? That's going
to be so uncomfortable.

423
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,729
Why would you think
of it that way?

424
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,070
He normally only invites
his close acquaintances.

425
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,109
But this time, he invited us.
You know what this means, right?

426
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,280
You know, right?

427
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:33,749
Anyway... Forget it. Let's
just all eat chicken soup.

428
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,850
What's all this?

429
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:41,950
What... I think
there's been a mistake.

430
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,189
We were just about to
order chicken soup.

431
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:46,890
Eat up. It's on the house.

432
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:48,689
- On the house?
- On the house?

433
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,700
Why are you suddenly
giving us free food?

434
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,070
I was told that a very
special guest is here.

435
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,140
I did bring 80 percent
of all the employees...

436
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,379
at our broadcasting company
if you think about it.

437
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:06,450
I may be a VIP customer,
but this is way too much.

438
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,780
You could go broke, you know.

439
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,280
Do you lack magnesium?

440
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,820
Why do you keep
twitching your eye?

441
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,559
Enjoy.

442
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,459
Every ingredient that's used
to cook traditional food...

443
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,999
has a special story behind them.

444
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:25,700
Yes, just like the chef here.

445
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,070
Doesn't she speak so eloquently?

446
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,200
Let's eat.

447
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,840
You're able to receive this
kind of special treatment...

448
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,039
because I'm your boss.

449
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,079
You little minions.

450
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,479
What do you keep staring at?

451
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:45,990
What?

452
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,390
It's nothing.

453
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,459
That guy...

454
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
It's him, isn't he?

455
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:02,539
Yes, it's him. You sneaky brat.

456
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,999
Come here and join us.

457
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:12,140
Me?

458
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,850
Seoul is a small city, isn't it?

459
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,780
We all met here by coincidence.

460
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,820
It's not a coincidence.

461
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:21,289
Then why were you here?

462
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,220
Because of Ms. Nam.

463
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,959
What's going on
between you guys?

464
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:27,530
Jae Hwan.

465
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,660
I have feelings for her
although she doesn't.

466
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,760
A one-sided love?

467
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,070
What a waste of
that handsome face.

468
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,870
He has feelings for
me, and so do I.

469
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,689
Why did you follow me?

470
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,689
Why did Yeon have you follow me?

471
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,700
Listen.

472
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:09,570
Do you still think I'm a little
kid who used to follow Yeon around?

473
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,070
I know you're not.

474
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,609
I also know that
you can kill me...

475
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,340
without leaving a single trace.

476
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,450
Then tell me why
you followed me.

477
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,350
You...

478
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:27,689
should know that
better than anyone.

479
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,620
Do you think we're
playing 20 questions?

480
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,059
All my life, I've
lived for Yeon.

481
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,930
And I was able to
live thanks to him.

482
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,059
That means I can't
do anything...

483
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,740
to cause him any harm even if
that could cost me my life.

484
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:58,749
Are you being loyal
or sympathetic?

485
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,090
Or are you just dumb?

486
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,059
It's the same reason...

487
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,459
why you're so obsessed about
hurting your older brother.

488
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,859
It's because we both like him.

489
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:20,240
I'm sorry if this is out of
line, but what do you do?

490
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,439
- What's your job?
- I don't have a job.

491
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,010
I knew it.

492
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,149
You have lots of time
but no job experience.

493
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:29,550
That's explains why
you've fallen for Ji A.

494
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,789
Can I break his ribs?

495
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,720
No, you can't. Hold your anger.

496
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,760
But seriously, do you
really not have a job?

497
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,700
- He gets paid rent.
- You own a building?

498
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:48,370
He owns 30 million dollars'
worth of real estate.

499
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,499
I do?

500
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:55,809
By any chance, do you
have any brothers?

501
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,379
- I do have a little brother.
- Then we can be in-laws.

502
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,950
How old are you?

503
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,090
I'm not that young.

504
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,359
- I'm a thousand...
- He's older than he looks.

505
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,689
- Have you done it once?
- Done what once?

506
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,430
He's asking if you're also
divorced just like him.

507
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,070
Is he the guy who got divorced
in less than a year...

508
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Yes.

509
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:24,340
I guess you know him.

510
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,109
He's never been married before.

511
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,709
He's like a guy you'd
see in a fantasy drama.

512
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,320
What's up with him?

513
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,419
That's his ritual.
He always does that.

514
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,850
Is it good?

515
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,590
Look. This is nice.

516
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,789
- Just eat it.
- By the way...

517
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,269
I need to go somewhere.

518
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

519
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,359
You're pretty.

520
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:19,220
You think I'm pretty?

521
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,890
Kids these days
have bad eyesight...

522
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,490
because they're always
on their smartphones.

523
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,729
- A eunuch.
- What?

524
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,229
What's a eunuch?

525
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,939
- It's really sad to explain...
- I'm not a eunuch.

526
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,109
- Do you want me to prove it?
- What are you doing with a kid?

527
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,669
He called me a eunuch.

528
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,780
Kids don't know how to lie.

529
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,180
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

530
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,189
I'm scared.

531
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,320
- What?
- Your face...

532
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,959
It's so scary.

533
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:05,870
Does that mean I have a
really bad first impression?

534
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,840
Yes. I heard kids
don't know how to lie.

535
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:14,550
Hey, you're here.

536
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,620
- Where is Shin Ju?
- He's still alive.

537
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,050
Don't take it out on him.

538
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,220
If you have something to say,
just talk to me directly.

539
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,160
You must care for him a lot.

540
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,829
I care for him a lot more
than my little brother...

541
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:30,530
who's still going through puberty
ever since the Joseon Dynasty.

542
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:35,930
Why did you put a tail on me?

543
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,769
I guess we're both not the
type to beat around the bush.

544
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:43,309
Why did it have to be an Imoogi?

545
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,079
You finally found out?

546
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,809
There are many other
ways to harm me.

547
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,249
So why did it have to be that?

548
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:53,820
I figured it'd be interesting
to reenact your past.

549
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,350
As you know, I'm an aesthete.

550
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,689
Does he have something on you?

551
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
I guess he does.

552
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,160
We both give and take, so
I'd call it a contract.

553
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,030
Listen to me carefully.

554
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:12,439
Sometimes, there are people you
should never make deals with.

555
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:13,709
I need to make a living.

556
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,039
It's not too late to stop.

557
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:19,280
If you don't stop now,
it'll come at a price.

558
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,550
Let me ask you something.

559
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:25,249
What if I was the one in danger?

560
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
What if my life was at stake?

561
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,220
Would you have
come to rescue me?

562
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,260
Save yourself.

563
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,870
You seem to be enjoying
yourself with your first love.

564
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,140
But if she knew everything...

565
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,370
that happened in her past life,
would she still stay with you?

566
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,780
If you touch her,

567
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,379
I'll really kill you this time.

568
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,559
Mr. Lee. I've located the kid.

569
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,129
Fine,

570
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,329
I'll let you kill me.

571
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:22,910
Give me Shin Ju.

572
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:28,309
You owe me for his life.

573
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:50,439
Mr. Lee.

574
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,680
Give me the glasses.

575
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:03,419
No. They're my magic glasses.

576
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:21,800
I won't go easy on you
just because you're a kid.

577
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,809
Stop it. I hate
hearing people cry.

578
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,850
If it were in the past,
I would've killed you.

579
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,120
I'm only going easy on you
because of the low birth rate.

580
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:58,640
No.

581
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:01,640
It can't be.

582
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:07,450
Geomdoong?

583
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,609
Yay! I'm so excited!

584
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,820
Faster!

585
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,620
Geomdoong...

586
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:30,970
I won't give my heart to
something like that again.

587
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,800
Never again...

588
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,390
Why did you follow me?

589
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,430
Are you Spiderman?

590
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,329
You moved all quickly
and stuff like Spiderman.

591
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,470
You're annoying to look at.

592
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,899
Then why did you buy me
yummy chocolate pastries?

593
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:06,140
I'm just paying a debt.

594
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,539
I'm saying, "Eat
this, and get lost."

595
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:09,709
A pet?

596
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:11,379
To brush their hair?

597
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:13,709
He looks dumb too.

598
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,720
Why did he have to be born as
a human being of all things?

599
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:44,879
Let's enter the castle.

600
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,740
Ms. Nam. Come quickly.

601
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,510
Hurry.

602
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,669
- Okay.
- Hurry.

603
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,510
There's a second floor too.

604
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,350
I wonder what something
like this costs.

605
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:25,019
Why? So you can buy one?

606
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:28,490
It's not bad, but it's too
far from the train station.

607
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,919
Whatever.

608
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,959
I've never seen ground
cherries in Seoul before.

609
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,070
Are these ground cherries?

610
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,800
They look like lanterns.

611
00:47:41,899 --> 00:47:46,200
I used to scoop out the inside
and blow on it like a recorder.

612
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:48,809
- Does this make sounds too?
- Of course.

613
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,939
My mom said it was bad luck,
that it would bring out a snake.

614
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:54,249
My gosh.

615
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,419
Don't touch that.

616
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:07,090
- It holds a special meaning for me.
- I see. I'm sorry.

617
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:10,160
I have only two
rules in this house.

618
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,760
One. Don't touch
the ground cherries.

619
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,700
- You can't blow on it either.
- It'll bring out a snake.

620
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:18,970
Second. You cannot go
up to the second floor.

621
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,609
Is someone there?

622
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,070
No, I live alone.

623
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,209
And the caterer.

624
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:29,050
Anyway, he says not to
go up there, so don't.

625
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,180
You must be hungry.

626
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,050
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

627
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,459
Water.

628
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,959
What?

629
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,490
- Water.
- Water.

630
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:48,729
Here.

631
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,999
- The cap.
- The cap.

632
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,709
You want me to feed you?

633
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,879
I'm injured.

634
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,079
Okay, fine.

635
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:18,600
- Where's Ms. Nam?
- She has dinner plans.

636
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:20,300
You don't need to go?

637
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,200
She went with colleagues.
She said she'll see me later.

638
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,740
Where's the chicken?

639
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,309
That's right. Chicken.

640
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,579
It's on its way.

641
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,550
- One whole chicken.
- Garlic drumsticks.

642
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:41,019
- Did you order original?
- Yes.

643
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,260
Seriously...

644
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,760
I'll let it slide since
that tastes good too.

645
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,499
Feed the dog before
the chicken comes.

646
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:52,559
Okay.

647
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,129
Anyway...

648
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:57,570
Are you really in pain?

649
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,439
Are you overreacting so that
you can order me around?

650
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:01,640
I'm hurt physically...

651
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,979
and emotionally.

652
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:07,209
See? What did I tell you?

653
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,510
I said that necklace
thief was suspicious.

654
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,149
Stop calling her a thief.

655
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:13,120
She has a nice name. Yu Ri.

656
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,359
Whatever her name is, she used
you because Rang put her up to it.

657
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,660
We had a bad start,
that's all. We're a 99.

658
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,959
What? What's 99?

659
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:25,160
Look.

660
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:31,169
It's a marital compatibility
test using names.

661
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,039
<font color="#00ff00">KI, KOO, YU, SHIN, RI, JU</font>

662
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,140
<font color="#00ff00">NAM, LEE, JI, YEON, A</font>

663
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,350
"Nam Ji A and Lee
Yeon." What? 25?

664
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,620
My back. My head.
My legs. My heart.

665
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,320
I'm going to redo
this. You did it wrong.

666
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,189
Okay, let's make a toast.

667
00:50:53,189 --> 00:50:54,359
"Unveiling Urban Legends".

668
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,430
I hope you'll continue
to dominate in ratings...

669
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,260
and stay on air
for years to come.

670
00:50:58,359 --> 00:50:59,430
We can do it.

671
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,970
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

672
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,439
- Tell me...
- When we went for the shoot,

673
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,510
I packed a cross, a rosary, a
talisman, everything there is.

674
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,680
And a case of medicine
to calm his nerves.

675
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,109
I'm sure he was prepared.
Although he was prepared,

676
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:15,979
the camera was
rattling in his hands.

677
00:51:15,979 --> 00:51:18,019
Ji A almost murdered him.

678
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:19,350
That's when I realized...

679
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,789
that people can be
scarier than ghosts.

680
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,559
Ji A has guts.

681
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:27,829
I recognized it during her interview
and made sure she stayed with us.

682
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,059
I remember. You said,

683
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,760
"You have to join
us no matter what."

684
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,669
I remember something too.

685
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:36,970
When we went to the workshop,

686
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,870
we were in the retreat
center, and the mic broke.

687
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:43,039
- So...
- Did you go to a workshop with me?

688
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,609
Yes, sir.

689
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,050
Anyway, do you believe in
ghosts and the supernatural?

690
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:56,350
A long time ago, I almost died.

691
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,189
It was a miracle
that I survived.

692
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:02,260
What I met that
day wasn't human.

693
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,930
Then what was it?

694
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:08,829
I said it was a miracle.

695
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,300
Gosh.

696
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:19,180
- Where's the bathroom?
- Go straight down the hall.

697
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:20,579
I'll be right back.

698
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,780
Sir. So...

699
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:28,749
You went with me to
the awards ceremony...

700
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:38,499
Is there someone upstairs?

701
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:51,039
Maybe I heard wrong.

702
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,990
I shouldn't be snooping
around someone else's home.

703
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:26,039
An artificial nail?

704
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,800
I must've been born
to drink champagne.

705
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,700
- Gosh.
- Stop him.

706
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,769
- Sir, I think you had enough.
- How dare you.

707
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:59,539
Champagne doesn't even
qualify as alcohol.

708
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,039
Shouldn't Ji A be back by now?

709
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:05,280
- Why don't I look for her?
- No, the guest should stay seated.

710
00:55:08,649 --> 00:55:09,780
We'll be here waiting, sir.

711
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,499
Welcome.

712
00:56:32,964 --> 00:56:35,074
- Hey.
- What time will the dinner be over?

713
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:37,684
In about 30 minutes, I think.

714
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:39,914
- Are you still at the vet?
- Yes.

715
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:42,153
Tell me the address
and I'll pick you up.

716
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:46,184
It's fine. The others and
I will take a cab together.

717
00:56:46,684 --> 00:56:48,854
All right. I'll see
you at home then.

718
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:50,324
See you in a bit.

719
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:57,264
Sir...

720
00:56:57,563 --> 00:56:59,104
I told you that the second
floor was off limits.

721
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,374
Sorry about that.

722
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:04,673
Is there someone
in the room though?

723
00:57:05,543 --> 00:57:07,374
I hear sounds coming from it.

724
00:57:07,443 --> 00:57:09,543
It must be the wind. The
window was left open.

725
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,213
Let's grab some dessert then.

726
00:57:13,383 --> 00:57:14,383
Sure.

727
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:48,184
Why are you crying?

728
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:53,124
Because it's been so long
since you've looked this happy.

729
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:00,764
Right.

730
00:58:01,363 --> 00:58:02,834
Well, enjoy it while it lasts...

731
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:05,764
and have this be the
look you remember me by.

732
00:58:07,003 --> 00:58:08,834
You're talking like
someone who's leaving.

733
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:10,434
As if that would happen.

734
00:58:11,943 --> 00:58:13,173
Please live a long life...

735
00:58:14,543 --> 00:58:18,343
and enjoy the happiest of
times while Ms. Nam lives hers.

736
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:25,084
Ji A, I'm glad you're
here. Are ghosts evil?

737
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:27,124
Is that why you hunt after them?

738
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:29,854
If that's the case,
they should be arrested.

739
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:31,824
Sir, let me tell you this.

740
00:58:32,124 --> 00:58:33,963
I believe we are a community.

741
00:58:33,963 --> 00:58:37,804
It doesn't matter if they
are supernatural beings.

742
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:41,503
When we actually encounter them,

743
00:58:42,104 --> 00:58:44,474
we should thank them...

744
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:47,313
for helping us earn a
living and beg for them...

745
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:50,414
to keep the antics up.

746
00:58:59,224 --> 00:59:01,093
You found this at his house?

747
00:59:01,894 --> 00:59:03,423
- Yes.
- It gives me the creeps.

748
00:59:03,554 --> 00:59:06,563
It's a glue-on artificial nail
with cheap embellishments.

749
00:59:06,563 --> 00:59:07,633
Who could it belong to?

750
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:09,733
It's neither yours or mine...

751
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:12,003
and none of the catering
staff had fake nails either.

752
00:59:12,764 --> 00:59:14,804
Also, his wife passed
away over a decade ago.

753
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:18,773
Why don't you ask if
he's dating anyone?

754
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:19,974
Directly?

755
00:59:20,273 --> 00:59:23,414
How can you get by in life
with a mindset like that?

756
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:28,014
It'll make more sense to
think that he has a hobby.

757
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:29,184
Doing nail art?

758
00:59:29,354 --> 00:59:31,253
As if that would make sense.

759
00:59:38,863 --> 00:59:41,193
Your rice is ready.

760
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:53,173
You're home.

761
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:58,313
Did you make dinner?
I already ate.

762
00:59:58,313 --> 01:00:01,454
I know that, but you said
you like freshly cooked rice.

763
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:03,454
I may not be a good cook,

764
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:05,954
but I can make the
best steamed rice.

765
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:11,724
So this is how it feels
to come home after work...

766
01:00:12,023 --> 01:00:13,124
to the smell of
freshly cooked rice.

767
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:16,233
I'll make sure you do
every day I'm here.

768
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,104
Here.

769
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,074
What's this?

770
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:23,633
I picked it up on the street.

771
01:00:26,843 --> 01:00:28,874
- Mint chocolate flavor?
- I'll go and change.

772
01:00:35,954 --> 01:00:38,023
For a second, I thought
she was handing me trash.

773
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:48,394
What do you normally
do at night?

774
01:00:51,304 --> 01:00:52,334
Watching American
TV shows, was it?

775
01:00:53,003 --> 01:00:55,733
I also read and watch the news.

776
01:00:57,804 --> 01:00:59,144
I usually watch movies.

777
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:01,443
Should we watch one?

778
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,383
Shall we?

779
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:06,843
- What's this?
- What...

780
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:25,264
Hey. Did you see that just now?

781
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:27,104
I can't believe it.

782
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,503
What I read online was true.

783
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:31,003
Let me see.

784
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,474
- My gosh.
- Is it on?

785
01:01:33,173 --> 01:01:34,773
Try this.

786
01:01:46,153 --> 01:01:48,854
What's wrong? Are you
not enjoying the movie?

787
01:01:50,324 --> 01:01:53,124
I'm enjoying it.

788
01:01:55,394 --> 01:01:58,764
I'm enjoying it so much
that I wish time would stop.

789
01:02:04,273 --> 01:02:05,443
Me too.

790
01:03:06,164 --> 01:03:09,273
For me, it's the smell
of freshly cooked rice.

791
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:11,443
New sneakers.

792
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:46,343
Put them on, and look at
yourself in the mirror.

793
01:03:46,744 --> 01:03:49,574
It'll give you the
answer to your question.

794
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:02,394
New sneakers.

795
01:04:03,454 --> 01:04:05,793
What kind of shoes
do women like?

796
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,403
Excuse me, can you...

797
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:19,744
My gosh.

798
01:04:22,074 --> 01:04:23,173
My goodness.

799
01:04:27,014 --> 01:04:30,253
- What do you want?
- I sent a gift to your lady.

01:04:31,224 --> 01:04:33,224
Have you heard of the
eyebrows of a tiger?

ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.</font>

804
01:05:25,943 --> 01:05:27,343
Gosh, how lame.

805
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:29,213
My gosh.

806
01:06:08,954 --> 01:06:11,584
She means nothing to me.

807
01:06:11,824 --> 01:06:15,324
Don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

808
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:16,853
Yeon.

809
01:06:50,454 --> 01:06:51,624
Did you see it?

810
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:57,164
Tell me. Did you see it?

811
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,973
Please look at me.

812
01:07:19,754 --> 01:07:20,884
What...

813
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:25,063
did you see?

814
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:27,494
I was...

815
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:30,863
murdered in my past life.

816
01:07:35,403 --> 01:07:36,674
You...

817
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:40,074
killed me.

818
01:07:42,744 --> 01:07:43,943
Your sole purpose...

819
01:07:45,414 --> 01:07:47,384
was to find the Imoogi.

820
01:07:49,914 --> 01:07:51,223
Yeon.

821
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:56,853
You used me...

822
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:00,794
to offer as sacrifice.

<i>If I ever get to be born again,</i>

825
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,973
<i>I want to live as a human being.</i>

826
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:51,584
<i>I'm not going to be
easy on you anymore.</i>

827
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:54,044
<i>Where is the Imoogi?</i>

828
01:08:54,183 --> 01:08:58,023
<i>You were born to be
offered to me as sacrifice.</i>

829
01:08:58,353 --> 01:08:59,683
<i>She's going to be my wife.</i>

830
01:08:59,954 --> 01:09:02,094
<i>What do you fear the most?</i>

831
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:03,653
<i>Yeou Gogae.</i>

832
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:06,964
<i>I'm willing to do anything now.</i>

833
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:08,893
<i>Mom!</i>

834
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:11,664
<i>Please hang in there
just a bit longer.</i>
