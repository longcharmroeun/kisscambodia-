1
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,274
It's empty.

2
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,022
- What?
- Everyone's gone.

3
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,768
What do mean?

4
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:31,826
It's as if the entire
village vanished.

5
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,708
Not even a human
shadow is in sight.

6
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:19,848
<font color="#00ff00">EOHWA SUPERMARKET</font>

7
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,648
- Did you check the restroom?
- There's nothing.

8
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,087
- What?
- The dead body from yesterday...

9
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,158
is gone.

10
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,158
It became a desert
island overnight.

11
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,428
They weren't taken
against their will.

12
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,298
I see no signs of a struggle
or hesitation marks.

13
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,867
Maybe they went on a group tour.

14
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,467
And took the corpse with them?

15
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:41,867
They left behind their
wallets and other valuables.

16
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,007
They just vanished.

17
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,507
Where could they have gone?

18
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:49,247
They vanished?

19
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:52,548
Right. 22 homes?

20
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,188
All 41 of the villagers?

21
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,488
Got it. I'll send some backup,

22
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,257
so call me if you find
anyone dead or injured.

23
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,387
Sure.

24
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,228
What is it?

25
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,527
That.

26
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,837
Since when have
those been there?

27
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,518
It's said...

28
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:33,157
that bamboos can
call the spirits.

29
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:34,527
Is it true?

30
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,928
They're hollow,

31
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,657
making them the perfect
guesthouse for lost spirits.

32
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,698
Doesn't it look like someone
formed some sort of path?

33
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,738
For the Dragon King.

34
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,768
I came across one while
covering a Jeju folk festival.

35
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,678
It's the path greeting
the Dragon King, right?

36
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:53,678
It is, but the direction is off.

37
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,377
Now that you mention it,

38
00:02:58,347 --> 00:02:59,717
it faces southwest.

39
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,148
Gwimunbang.

40
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,148
<font color="#00ff00">THE BEARING THAT LETS
THOSE EVIL IN AND OUT</font>

41
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,657
The bearing that lets
those evil in and out.

42
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,488
So this door wasn't set up...

43
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,928
to welcome the real Dragon King.

44
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:22,168
I'm Hyeonuiong of the
Afterlife Immigration Office.

45
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,478
How's King Hades?

46
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:28,347
I just called because we
need more shroud today.

47
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,877
Would an express
delivery be possible?

48
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,548
Okay.

49
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:33,717
All right.

50
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,548
Have a good one. Bye.

51
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,527
- What did you find out?
- I don't get why this is happening.

52
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,168
Are you sure it's an Imoogi?

53
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,967
Are you not able to
see where it went?

54
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,067
Did it use a talisman? It
didn't leave a single trace.

55
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,437
Shouldn't we tell Yeon?

56
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:57,907
Stop causing a fuss.

57
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,978
Yeon should never find out.

58
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,048
- But...
- Shut your mouth.

59
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,108
Okay.

60
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,157
I wonder if this was why...

61
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:15,958
I couldn't foresee
Yeon's future.

62
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,268
Hey.

63
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:27,568
I actually heard something
weird past midnight yesterday.

64
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:28,967
What did you hear?

65
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,938
It sounded like a crying baby.

66
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,308
Be more specific.

67
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,777
It was a little over 2am.

68
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,417
I woke up because I got thirsty.

69
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,527
At first, I thought
it was a stray cat.

70
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:52,198
But it wasn't. I'm sure it
sounded like a crying baby.

71
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,427
There were no pregnant
ladies on this island.

72
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,297
All the old ladies are over 70.

73
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,737
- What was the time again?
- It was 2:40am.

74
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,777
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

75
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,607
The clocks weren't working.

76
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,648
Both the wall clock
and table clock.

77
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:15,287
My watch isn't working
either. It's exactly 2:40am.

78
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,058
It's the hour of the cow.

79
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,258
<font color="#00ff00">THE HOUR OF THE COW:
IN BETWEEN 1AM TO 3AM</font>

80
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:22,527
It's when the door to
the other world opens up.

81
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,758
I wonder what
happened last night.

82
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:49,188
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 4: THE VERGE OF DEATH</font>

83
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,787
- Happy birthday Dear Yu Ri
- Happy birthday Dear Yu Ri.

84
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,927
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you.

85
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,198
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Yu Ri.

86
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:02,427
- Here. This is from me.
- And this is from me.

87
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,277
Thanks, you guys.

88
00:06:13,277 --> 00:06:15,177
- Do you like it?
- Of course.

89
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:17,217
I'm so happy that I might cry.

90
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,188
Sweetheart, when are you
going to get married?

91
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,087
She's still young.

92
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,558
- She's 24. That's not young.
- She's 25.

93
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,998
No, she was 24.

94
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,438
Dad, do you have dementia?

95
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,607
Didn't that accident
occur when she was 24?

96
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,677
She was a senior in college.

97
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,148
What accident?

98
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,347
Yu Ri went to Nepal
to go trekking.

99
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:53,248
But she fell and died.

100
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:56,148
Honey, why would you say
something so horrible?

101
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,258
I'm serious. I'm sure I saw...

102
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,787
her body back then.

103
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:06,227
Dad, I told you to forget all
those unnecessary memories.

104
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:10,568
Who... Who are you?

105
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,277
Why are you buying
me a cell phone?

106
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,948
Because my little brother
stole your cell phone.

107
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,248
I'm not being nice. I'm
just doing what I should.

108
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:25,948
Keep in mind that you need to
use follow the 48 month-plan.

109
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,518
You can pay for the penalty.

110
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:29,518
I downloaded an application.

111
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,518
Don't answer any calls from
unknown numbers or my brother.

112
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,787
I'm surprised you're a techie.

113
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,427
I realized it's pretty difficult
to keep things traditional.

114
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:41,227
What?

115
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,498
Around this time last year,

116
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,398
I got a call from Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

117
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,467
Someone illegally used my name!

118
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,568
Don't tell me it was
a voice phishing scam.

119
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:53,107
I ripped off the ears of the guy
who stole 20,000 dollars from me.

120
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,277
But that's still not enough.
I can't sleep at night.

121
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,118
Here.

122
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,047
Give me your number.

123
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,087
You told me not to answer any
calls from unknown numbers.

124
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,628
Don't you know
enough about me now?

125
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:11,758
There are a few things I
didn't get to ask last night.

126
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,967
And I want to know more
about you while I'm at it.

127
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,768
Fine. You're very consistent.

128
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:22,568
People tend to
say that about me.

129
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,008
I'll see you again.

130
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,898
It's me, your beloved daughter.

131
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,687
What was your wish?

132
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:16,287
I wanted my daughter
to come back to life.

133
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,898
I gave you what you wanted.

134
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:23,998
Who is she?

135
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:26,297
She's my daughter, Ki Yu Ri.

136
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,268
She's 25 years old,

137
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,577
and she's going to take
over my department store.

138
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:35,177
Okay, you guys can go now.

139
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,047
Rang, I missed you.

140
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,088
Did you meet the vet?

141
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:47,018
- Yes.
- How was he?

142
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,427
He was a lot cuter
than I had imagined.

143
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,527
He got scared as soon
as he saw my gun.

144
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,067
You can keep that. He'll come
for it at the right time.

145
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,067
What should I do
then? Can I kill him?

146
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,238
Yu Ri.

147
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,508
Do you know when
clams taste the best?

148
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,738
- No, not really.
- When peach blossoms bloom.

149
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,848
That's when the shells become
hard and the flesh becomes juicy.

150
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,248
If you want the best ingredients,
you need to learn how to wait.

151
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,287
Treat him well, and
show him a good time.

152
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,827
Yeon really cares
a lot about him.

153
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,628
Okay.

154
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,728
Are you going somewhere?

155
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:29,827
Yeon is probably dying
to see me right now.

156
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,838
I should go greet him.

157
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,037
Why did you want to meet here?

158
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,047
I got curious. You
always spend time here.

159
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,817
Let me try your mint
chocolate ice cream.

160
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:46,878
Don't touch it.

161
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:51,287
Gosh, it tastes like
chocolate and toothpaste.

162
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:52,888
Why do you eat this?

163
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,427
I played along with your
nonsense, so tell me.

164
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,498
- Tell you what?
- The people on that island.

165
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:00,827
Where did they all go?

166
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,197
Who cares?

167
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,638
I know you don't
care about them.

168
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:11,407
From what I know, one
of them wasn't human.

169
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,508
I also heard a similar rumor...

170
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,018
saying something peculiar lives
inside the well in the mountain.

171
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,148
- What's that?
- Why?

172
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,988
Do you think it might be him?

173
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,927
The snake that took
your lady away from you?

174
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,697
I already killed that thing.

175
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,968
Life doesn't always
go as you planned.

176
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,567
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

177
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,277
But I know one thing for sure.

178
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,848
Your lady...

179
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,417
won't get to live a long
life this time either.

180
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:05,797
Have you ever heard of
"the vanishing effect"?

181
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:07,927
"Vanishing"? As in "Disappear"?

182
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,268
It's when someone suddenly
vanishes into thin air.

183
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,707
And something similar also
happened on an island...

184
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,008
in North Carolina.

185
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:21,878
In 1590, every single person
on this island disappeared.

186
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:25,047
All their belongings
remained the same.

187
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:26,417
Only the people disappeared.

188
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,527
Why did you become so messed up?

189
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:38,128
You were the one who abandoned
the forest to protect your love.

190
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,827
600 years have
passed since then.

191
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,098
And I spent all those
years cursing you.

192
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,437
What do you want me to do?

193
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:55,277
There's only one way to stop me.

194
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,248
Kill me here and now...

195
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,447
with your own two hands.

196
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:10,057
Kill me.

197
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,457
Just like how you came
to hunt me down that day.

198
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:37,817
Please... Please don't kill me.

199
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,618
Please don't kill me.

200
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:42,628
Rang.

201
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,338
Yeon.

202
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,077
Is it really you?

203
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:21,628
How long has it
been? You were alive.

204
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,338
I didn't hear from you since
you went to the Samdo River,

205
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,697
so I thought you had died.

206
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,407
I've missed you.

207
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,707
I've missed you so much, Yeon.

208
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,547
Why didn't you come for me?

209
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:38,947
I did.

210
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:41,187
I did,

211
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,588
but I couldn't find you.

212
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,118
I lost you.

213
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,358
After you left,

214
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,957
people set fire to the mountain.

215
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,498
I wanted to wait for you there,

216
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:59,838
but it was too hot and scary.

217
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,768
Is that why you killed
all these people?

218
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,677
Even the innocent ones?

219
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,518
They're sinning by just
being alive and breathing.

220
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,388
I just wiped out a village.

221
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:20,118
They knelt at my feet and
begged for their lives.

222
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:22,488
I see.

223
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:28,868
You couldn't walk past
an injured dog before.

224
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,407
You've changed so much.

225
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,037
Join me.

226
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,307
Let's teach the
humans who we are.

227
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:46,618
Rang.

228
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,417
Yes?

229
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,858
Raise...

230
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,907
Raise your sword.

231
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,108
What are you saying, Yeon?

232
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,407
It's the order of
the afterlife judges.

233
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,527
Lee Rang, who murdered
countless innocent lives...

234
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:36,598
shall pay...

235
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,437
for his sins today
with his life.

236
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,138
You're a real jerk.

237
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,338
You dumped your
brother for a girl,

238
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,338
then you betrayed him to
bring your numbers up.

239
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,977
As long as you save up your miles
and get her reincarnated, right?

240
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,848
I survived only because
you missed a vital point.

241
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,578
If I had died then, I'd
be burning right now...

242
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,318
in the Underworld of
the Fiery Cauldron.

243
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:31,417
What? You can't get
yourself to do it twice?

244
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:36,858
Kill me.

245
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,358
That's the only way
your woman can live.

246
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,407
Fine. It wouldn't be so bad
to end your life early...

247
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,767
rather than live
recklessly like this.

248
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,778
Do it.

249
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,382
Why?

250
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,513
Why can't you do it?

251
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:30,453
Stop acting like
an abandoned child.

252
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:32,552
You're not a kid anymore.

253
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,332
I can do it.

254
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:44,003
Do you know why I'm holding
back? Because I want to see...

255
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,403
the look on your face
when she dies again...

256
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,673
before your very eyes.

257
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,342
No matter how weak you act,

258
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,842
I know this isn't
your true self.

259
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:56,582
What?

260
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:58,913
Bye.

261
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:15,163
Anyway, please make sure
the media doesn't find out.

262
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,532
I can keep my mouth shut,

263
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,532
but will the families of
the missing people do so?

264
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:20,933
There aren't any.

265
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,542
What?

266
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:24,473
They don't have any
families or relatives.

267
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,112
- All 41 people from the village?
- Yes.

268
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:30,342
What's even eerie is, they weren't
even natives to the island.

269
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,413
- Then?
- They all migrated together...

270
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:33,753
sometime in the 1950s.

271
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,822
On the same day,
on the same boat.

272
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,903
You don't know what it feels like
to live with your direct supervisor.

273
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:51,872
Shin Ju.

274
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,003
Don't you ever get married.

275
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,102
I don't have anyone anyway.

276
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:59,473
Marriage for a man is like scoring
into your own goal. Heed my words.

277
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,042
Your brother-in-law
is King Hades.

278
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,183
It would at least be a winning
goal during stoppage time.

279
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,013
Are you a ref?

280
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:06,913
Are you the judge of my life?

281
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:08,753
Oh, come on.

282
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:11,153
Why are you picking on Shin Ju?

283
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,893
Don't you get
married again either.

284
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,862
Stay... Stay a widow forever.

285
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,233
How could you say that?

286
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:23,763
I would've punched you already
if it weren't for King Hades.

287
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,433
How did you two meet, anyway?

288
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,102
It was a crime of sorts.

289
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,782
A long time ago,
my wife peeped...

290
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:37,213
while I bathed in a stream.

291
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,052
It was love at first sight.

292
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:43,822
Correct. I've got
a rocking body.

293
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:45,592
Wait. Then...

294
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,663
did she ask you out first?

295
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,393
I was abducted that night.

296
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:53,362
She threw a sack over my
head and carried me off.

297
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,203
- What?
- She sat me down...

298
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:56,233
and said two things.

299
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:59,403
"Will you live with me
or go to the Underworld?"

300
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,503
"Will you sleep with me
or go to the Underworld?"

301
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,673
So I slept with her.

302
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,013
How dare you?

303
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:15,183
How dare you forget your
position and kill a person?

304
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:17,082
That shaman?

305
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:19,723
She looked fine on the outside, but
she was clearly due to die soon.

306
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:22,263
Regardless, she was
not on the list!

307
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:24,733
It was an emergency.

308
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:28,132
Your punishment has been
decided. What were you thinking?

309
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,933
I'll gladly accept
any punishment.

310
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:33,433
So don't be so obvious
about worrying about me.

311
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:36,203
Was it because of that girl?

312
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,072
Did you finally find her?

313
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:49,822
But...

314
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,292
she doesn't have the fox
bead that I gave her.

315
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,463
You must have the wrong girl.

316
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,733
But she looks too much like her.

317
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:01,503
Her face.

318
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:02,862
I'll protect you.

319
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,102
Her voice.

320
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,602
It's burning hot.

321
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,842
Even that jerk's scales that covered
A Eum's body just before she died.

322
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:10,403
Stop here.

323
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:14,812
- What do you mean?
- A fox and a human cannot be.

324
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,683
Your obsession will
bring about calamity.

325
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:21,253
To both you and
her who was reborn.

326
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,393
I don't wish for
anything that grand.

327
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:30,263
Then?

328
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,032
Even if we live for
thousands of years,

329
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,332
We all have a time we cherish.

330
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:39,332
The era which we
loved above all.

331
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:45,243
In your case, it was the 80s.

332
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,243
It's when you
discovered a new hobby.

333
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,743
<font color="#00ff00">"FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE"</font>

334
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:55,562
When Leslie Cheung passed away,

335
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,384
you drank for three
days straight.

336
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:01,723
So?

337
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,163
That's how it was for me too.

338
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:18,473
The time I cherish is when she
breathed the same air as mine.

339
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,173
Even if she is reborn,

340
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:23,542
she wouldn't be the same person.

341
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:24,612
I don't care.

342
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:28,183
All I want...

343
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:32,522
is to see her gradually grow
old while experiencing...

344
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,263
the joy, anger, sorrow,
and pleasure in life.

345
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,163
In order for that to happen,
there's a job I must do.

346
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,572
- Yes?
- What's up?

347
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,483
Oh, well... I'm about
to have my meal.

348
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:58,112
- Did you receive your order?
- Yes. Why?

349
00:23:58,112 --> 00:23:59,282
Send it back to the kitchen.

350
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:01,413
What are you getting at?

351
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,253
I'm asking you out for a meal.

352
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,493
Granny, I'll be
back after I eat.

353
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:10,562
Hey!

354
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,963
The Laws of the Afterlife
isn't some joke.

355
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,332
But I haven't been able to
take even a sip of water today.

356
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,203
This is the last
time I'll be lenient.

357
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,673
You are to be back
before midnight.

358
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:25,213
Wait. Didn't you see someone
suspicious leaving the island?

359
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:29,643
- I'm not your personal dashcam!
- I knew you'd say that.

360
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,082
You never help me out.

361
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,042
- You're here.
- Hey.

362
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:04,013
- Come on in.
- Sure.

363
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:07,683
- Should I close the gate?
- Yes, please.

364
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:08,852
Then I will.

365
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:18,532
- Hold on. Did you...
- Yes, I made it all myself.

366
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:20,362
I'm good at pretty
much everything.

367
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,163
Not what's most
important though.

368
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:24,903
Modesty doesn't put
food on the table. I do.

369
00:25:26,203 --> 00:25:28,342
By the way, what's
that behind your back?

370
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,003
- It looks like flowers.
- It's not.

371
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:32,812
Muster up the courage
to hand it over.

372
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:43,223
It's a bundle of
mugwort, not flowers.

373
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,393
I'll be in debt if I
accept the meal for free...

374
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:48,622
and I couldn't be bothered.

375
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:50,092
Do you like it?

376
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:51,763
I'll sit here.

377
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:56,403
Talk about a soulless response.

378
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,973
It's not what you'd expect
as a housewarming gift.

379
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:01,433
Should I put this in water
or prep it for a meal?

380
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:05,612
When no life was present
on a land that was nuked,

381
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,372
mugwort was first to grow.

382
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:08,713
It's just like you, right?

383
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:11,683
Yes, it's my cup of tea.

384
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:18,493
- What are you doing?
- Animals like being patted.

385
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:29,562
My dog usually likes it
when I pat it this way.

386
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:41,842
There.

387
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:53,052
It's good.

388
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:55,062
Help yourself to more.

389
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,362
Why the sudden change
of heart though?

390
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:06,332
Humans...

391
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:09,542
offer food to other people when
expressing their gratitude.

392
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:14,612
You saved my life twice already,
but this ordinary meal...

393
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:17,082
was the only way I could
somewhat repay the favor.

394
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:23,382
It's special enough.

395
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:28,393
At least to me today.

396
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,739
<font color="#00ff00">"YEOU GOGAE ACCIDENT, A PROFESSOR
AND DOCTOR COUPLE VANISHED"</font>

397
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,782
I see you still live here.

398
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,753
It's the same for people
with lost family members.

399
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,522
We can't easily move.

400
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:05,993
We stay in the same house
so that our families...

401
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:08,332
can find their way back.

402
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,572
It must've been lonely to
live alone in his big house.

403
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,072
Why are you laughing?

404
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,943
Because I can't cry.

405
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:21,513
Hearing that I
could've been lonely...

406
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,483
makes me wonder...

407
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:27,552
if that's how it was
for me growing up.

408
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,622
They must've been great parents.

409
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:36,723
They were.

410
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:39,763
If only they were mean though.

411
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:43,403
If they were, I
might've been able...

412
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,973
to forget about them and
move on with my life.

413
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:13,233
Doing this sucks
the tears back in.

414
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,703
It's a secret I acquired at
nine after losing my parents.

415
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:29,413
You'll be able to
find your parents.

416
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:34,253
I'll make sure of it.

417
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:38,953
So enjoy some normalcy
in the rest of your life.

418
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:42,163
I'm talking about the boring...

419
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:44,663
but warm life others enjoy.

420
00:29:57,203 --> 00:30:00,812
About that first
love you mentioned...

421
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:01,872
In your dreams.

422
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,743
My first love was like
a delicate flower.

423
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,082
And I'm like a weed.

424
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,552
I'm like mugwort that
grows on irradiated soil.

425
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:13,923
For a mugwort, you grew up fine.

426
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:29,203
Thank you for what you
did on Eohwa Island.

427
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,203
Don't mention it.

428
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:34,372
When I was on the brink of death
after being sliced by Yeon,

429
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:38,282
you saved me.

430
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:53,592
That's what I call fate.

431
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:57,263
So how's the kid?

432
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,332
It's asleep.

433
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:04,102
You're admirable, I have to say.

434
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:05,872
It astounds me to know...

435
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:08,473
how you devoted 600 years
of your life to serve it.

436
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:11,542
Because I'm human.

437
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:13,612
An ordinary human being...

438
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:16,453
who desperately wants to
find a way to stay alive.

439
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:24,092
I've never come across anyone
with a decent ending...

440
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:26,693
who drew power from my
realm to stay alive.

441
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:31,532
So where do you go from here?

442
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,973
I'll feed, let it sleep,
and wait for it to grow.

443
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:37,443
I'll look forward to it.

444
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:42,542
When the protagonist falls in
love with his long-lost love,

445
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:45,042
their tragic story will
be repeated once again.

446
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:52,653
A funeral hall?

447
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,393
- Must you go there?
- Why?

448
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,862
It's not the best of time
to go to such a place.

449
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,532
What do you mean by that?

450
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,062
Why do you think
your ancestors...

451
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,473
showered and sprinkled salt
after coming back from a funeral?

452
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:07,832
It's because evil spirits
get attached to you there.

453
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:11,943
I'm grateful for your concern,
but I must be present.

454
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,582
You've already stepped
foot into my realm.

455
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:18,983
So you're worried that petty
spirits will latch onto me?

456
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:22,653
Whatever it is, what you can
see can also see you back.

457
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:26,022
On top of that, I'll be
leaving Seoul for a few days.

458
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,322
Are you going on a trip?

459
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:32,092
I guess you can say it's
something like that.

460
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,733
- So...
- I don't want to avoid it.

461
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,832
Especially if I'll be living
in that world from now on.

462
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:44,372
Wait here.

463
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:46,842
What?

464
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:53,713
Here.

465
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:57,852
It's a bag filled with red
beans that add up to your age.

466
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:59,693
Don't lose it. Keep it
with you at all times.

467
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,753
Is it like a talisman?

468
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,963
It's old school, but it'll last
a day or two since I made it.

469
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:07,963
Thanks.

470
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:10,263
I'll be off now.
Have a fun trip.

471
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:11,703
Okay.

472
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:24,782
For some strange reason,
I can't seem to leave.

473
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,683
I wonder if it's okay to
leave her all by herself.

474
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:46,802
What's your favorite movie?

475
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,842
"Toy Story 3". Why?

476
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,172
<font color="#00ff00">- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?
- "TOY STORY 3". WHY?</font>

477
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:55,373
I just want to know
more about you.

478
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:09,763
Bye.

479
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:11,763
Do you have the red bean bag?

480
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:14,732
Yes.

481
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,152
You brat.

482
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:39,752
I thought you weren't
going to come.

483
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,822
I heard you never once cried.

484
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:43,822
You really are something.

485
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,473
I'm sorry for being late.

486
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,212
My mom...

487
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,643
asked me to take her
to a hanbok store...

488
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,212
because they say you
live a long life...

489
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:06,752
if you buy your shroud in
advance on a leap year.

490
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:09,683
But I kept postponing it. And
in the end, I never took her.

491
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:12,523
Every time she called,

492
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:16,362
I always hung up on
her saying I'm busy.

493
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:19,763
Last week,

494
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:23,333
she made my favorite,
dongchimi for me.

495
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:26,802
But I didn't go
because I overslept.

496
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,643
You really were a bad daughter.

497
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,243
I know, right?

498
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:36,243
Yes.

499
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,252
My mom made the best dongchimi.

500
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,152
But I can't eat it anymore.

501
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:49,623
Cry all you want.

502
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:54,063
If you hold it in now,
it'll leave a scar.

503
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:02,402
Where is it this time?

504
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:04,973
Send me somewhere
warm if you can.

505
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:07,212
I'm old now, so I
get cold easily.

506
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:08,942
I said I get cold easily.

507
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,282
Here's a message from
the afterlife judges.

508
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:19,152
"Lee Yeon, former mountain
spirit of Baekdudaegan."

509
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:21,353
"Based on Article 24
of the criminal law,"

510
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:23,293
"you deserve to be sent to
the First Underworld..."

511
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,962
"for having killed
a human being."

512
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:29,002
"However, we take into consideration
all the lives you’ve saved,"

513
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:31,563
"so you will be put on
probation for a week."

514
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:35,032
Wait a minute. "A
week"? That's too long.

515
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,672
"However, during that week,"

516
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:40,973
"you will live inside
a human body..."

517
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,482
"and feel the pain of life,"

518
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:45,583
"old age, sickness, and death."

519
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:46,813
What the...

520
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,020
<font color="#00ff00">"DIRECTOR KI YU RI WILL QUICKLY
TAKE OVER MOZE DEPARTMENT STORE"</font>

521
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:12,942
"Ki Yu Ri"?

522
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:31,523
You're the necklace thief.

523
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,092
- Hi.
- How did you find me here?

524
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:37,362
I thought you'd come for
this, but you didn't.

525
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,732
That's because you
carry around a gun.

526
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:40,773
Relax.

527
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,342
I'm not armed today.

528
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:45,773
What do you want?

529
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:47,273
Let's have fun.

530
00:38:01,393 --> 00:38:02,623
How is she?

531
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:05,362
I made her cry a bucket,
and now she's dizzy.

532
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:10,163
- Make sure she eats this.
- Got it.

533
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,132
The yukgaejang here
tastes pretty nice.

534
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,243
What are you doing here?

535
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,782
Stop overreacting and sit down.

536
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:25,643
I gave her more money
than you for consolation.

537
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:28,583
Sit down...

538
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,683
if you don't want your friend
to die just like her mother.

539
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:47,973
What do you want?

540
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,103
Are things going well with Yeon?

541
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:52,842
Yes, we're really
hitting it off...

542
00:38:53,442 --> 00:38:56,683
seeing that his one and only
brother keeps visiting me like this.

543
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,382
Aren't you scared of me?

544
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:03,052
I am scared. I heard a guy who
has an inferiority complex...

545
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,252
is pretty much like
a ticking bomb.

546
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:08,453
You got that right.

547
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:10,223
Why do you hate your
older brother so much?

548
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:13,893
I'm just bored.

549
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,163
You're lying.

550
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,072
I bet you really
liked your brother.

551
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:25,342
That's why you're
being like this.

552
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:42,993
You weren't lying when you told me
you got smuggled here from Russia.

553
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:44,123
What are you doing?

554
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:46,532
I'm a vet.

555
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:48,333
That scar on your body.

556
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,232
I saw something similar on animals
that were locked up in zoos.

557
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,973
You were abused by a
human being, weren't you?

558
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:57,603
Don't look at me like
that. It's annoying.

559
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:00,513
- I'm sorry.
- Don't even apologize.

560
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,413
I'm never going to give
you back your necklace.

561
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,112
It's very precious to me.

562
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:08,882
That's why I took it from you.

563
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,982
Who is it? Who's
making you do this?

564
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:13,893
Try taking back your
necklace yourself.

565
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,192
Then I'll tell you.

566
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:26,632
A long time ago, there
was a mountain spirit...

567
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,732
who abandoned his own mountain.

568
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:33,273
All the humans who used
to come and make wishes...

569
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:37,313
set the mountain on fire to
get rid of all the foxes.

570
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,813
Every living soul
burned to death.

571
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:44,482
The puppies I raised
like my own...

572
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:46,953
all turned into charcoal.

573
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:49,962
Did that happen...

574
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,732
because of his first love?

575
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:58,032
Yeon thinks you are
her reincarnation.

576
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,802
That's why he killed the shaman
even though he was aware...

577
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:03,703
of the consequences.

578
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:06,913
"The consequences"?

579
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,482
Where is Yeon right now?

580
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:13,353
In a place I'm pretty sure
that has bad reception.

581
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:22,530
<font color="#00ff00">THE SNOW MOUNTAIN PRISON</font>

582
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:53,853
Where is he?

583
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:06,002
You don't need to know that.

584
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:08,502
If you want to live,

585
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,002
you'd better not
fall asleep tonight.

586
00:42:24,982 --> 00:42:26,052
Look at room number six.

587
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:29,822
Why are there so many
people there at this hour?

588
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:33,032
They all look like
small children.

589
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:35,663
Why are you so interested
in other people's business?

590
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:15,703
Time in the Underworld flows
differently from the living realm.

591
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:20,513
One day in this world is
seven years in the Underworld.

592
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,413
You do not eat.

593
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,453
You do not sleep.

594
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:29,552
You cannot...

595
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:31,583
even die.

596
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,887
<font color="#00ff00">"A BETTER TOMORROW"</font>

597
00:43:44,343 --> 00:43:45,803
That's how it was for me too.

598
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:49,426
The time I cherish is when she
breathed the same air as mine.

599
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:51,473
I'll gladly accept
any punishment.

600
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:54,813
All I want is to see her
gradually grow old...

601
00:43:55,935 --> 00:43:58,504
while experiencing the joy, anger,
sorrow, and pleasure in life.

602
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:04,123
You fool.

603
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:26,942
The phone is turned off. Your call
is being forwarded to voicemail.

604
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:29,072
Please leave a message
after the tone.

605
00:44:58,402 --> 00:44:59,543
Is it a blackout?

606
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:26,302
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

607
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:48,293
Hi.

608
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:53,063
You must be sisters.

609
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:55,993
How old are you?

610
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:00,902
What are you doing here?

611
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,942
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

612
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:05,002
- Have you seen our dad?
- Have you seen our dad?

613
00:46:05,002 --> 00:46:06,513
Did you lose your dad?

614
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:08,543
Which room was he in?

615
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,422
Do you want me to
find him for you?

616
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:24,023
Let's go.

617
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:27,532
What's this?

618
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:32,902
Why are your shoes mismatched?

619
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:35,873
Ms. Nam!

620
00:46:38,473 --> 00:46:39,572
Hey.

621
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:44,083
She finished the rice cakes.

622
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:45,743
Good work.

623
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:47,013
Ms. Kim told us to go home.

624
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:48,583
She wants to rest too.

625
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:51,382
She did? Hold on.

626
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:56,723
Where did the kids go?

627
00:46:56,993 --> 00:46:59,063
- Kids?
- Yes.

628
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:00,893
They were just here.

629
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,263
They probably went with
their parents. Let's go.

630
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:05,132
Okay.

631
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:13,473
Are you taking a cab?
I'll drop you off.

632
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:15,842
No. I'm exhausted,

633
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:18,643
but my mom said to walk
around for a while...

634
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,052
and shake off all
the evil spirits.

635
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:22,853
She must believe in bad luck.

636
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:25,683
She goes to church, but
she's so superstitious.

637
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:30,692
- See you tomorrow.
- Good job today.

638
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,313
When did this...

639
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:30,822
Ms. Nam!

640
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,763
She lost the talisman
that I gave her.

641
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,833
Was it Rang? Or...

642
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:47,103
Granny.

643
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:49,032
I need to talk to you.

644
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:53,043
I know you hear me.

645
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:55,373
Untie me.

646
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:58,183
Granny. Please.

647
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:00,252
Untie me!

648
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,822
Untie me! Quickly!

649
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:06,652
Untie me already!

650
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:10,563
Darn it. Darn it, Granny!

651
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:18,532
Why are you being so loud?

652
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:24,203
Granny. I need to get out
of here. Untie me. Quickly.

653
00:49:24,203 --> 00:49:27,413
You punk! Don't you know
where you are right now?

654
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:29,712
I'll go to the
Underworld of Knives.

655
00:49:30,643 --> 00:49:32,743
That's where I was headed if
my sentence wasn't reduced.

656
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,683
Then I can get out
within the day.

657
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:37,953
Or you may never get out...

658
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:40,223
in that body.

659
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:48,493
I don't care.

660
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:17,063
Here. Do you feel better?

661
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:19,163
Yes.

662
00:50:22,163 --> 00:50:23,402
What happened to me?

663
00:50:23,663 --> 00:50:25,462
You fainted outside
the funeral home.

664
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:29,473
- I'm cold.
- You're cold?

665
00:50:37,543 --> 00:50:41,013
Did something happen there?

666
00:50:44,723 --> 00:50:46,223
I saw some young kids.

667
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:48,252
Twice.

668
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:49,822
What did they look like?

669
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:51,763
They were sisters.

670
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:54,192
They were wearing
pretty dresses...

671
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:57,203
and mismatched shoes.

672
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:58,862
Were they ghosts?

673
00:50:59,802 --> 00:51:02,072
- What?
- When ghosts imitate humans,

674
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:04,543
they do the opposite
in certain things.

675
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,513
- You don't believe in ghosts.
- Hold on.

676
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:14,054
<font color="#00ff00">"STRANGE TALES OF JOSEON",
"COLLECTION OF KOREAN LEGENDS"</font>

677
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:19,782
I looked into it,

678
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:23,152
and that funeral home used
to be a children's cemetery.

679
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:25,063
A children's cemetery?

680
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:28,163
A cemetery just for children?

681
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:31,663
Yes. They tore it down and
built the funeral home.

682
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:35,603
- But Jae Hwan.
- Yes?

683
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:37,243
Why do you keep...

684
00:51:39,002 --> 00:51:41,013
holding the book upside down?

685
00:51:57,793 --> 00:51:58,862
She caught us.

686
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:30,491
<font color="#00ff00">THE UNDERWORLD OF KNIVES</font>

687
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:54,112
Cross the bridge.

688
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:56,152
Take your first step...

689
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:58,922
and you won't be able to
leave until you cross it.

690
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:04,063
Could I do it...

691
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,732
in this physical state I'm in?

692
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:26,143
Whatever it is, what you can
see can also see you back.

693
00:53:27,612 --> 00:53:29,552
It's a bag filled with red
beans that add up to your age.

694
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:31,683
Don't lose it. Keep it
with you at all times.

695
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:44,063
Yeon...

696
00:54:35,282 --> 00:54:37,252
Granny, see you
on the other end.

697
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:47,592
The sinner will cross
the Underworld of Knives!

698
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:55,316
My cell phone.

699
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:13,265
Who's there?

700
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:27,285
Two.

701
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:30,256
Three.

702
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,385
Four.

703
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:36,695
Five.

704
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:43,336
What do you want from me?

705
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:01,086
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

706
00:57:01,316 --> 00:57:03,825
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

707
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:07,095
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

708
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:10,026
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

709
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,626
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

710
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:15,166
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

711
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:35,726
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

712
01:01:35,956 --> 01:01:38,095
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

713
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:40,095
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

714
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:42,836
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

715
01:01:58,945 --> 01:01:59,986
Thanks, Yeon.

716
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,956
The 9-year-old me and
the 30-year-old me...

717
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:05,856
both lived thanks to you.

718
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:09,495
You see,

719
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:14,296
I may not be able to kick
butt and control the weather,

720
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:19,035
but I'll return
the favor someday.

721
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:21,476
I promised you...

722
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:23,405
that I will...

723
01:02:24,646 --> 01:02:25,976
protect you.

724
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:27,345
Your lady...

725
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:29,745
won't get to live a long
life this time either.

726
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:35,785
I don't care who she is.

727
01:02:36,655 --> 01:02:38,456
I don't care whether or not she's
the person I've been looking for.

728
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:42,256
None of that matters anymore.

729
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,896
All I know is one thing.

730
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:50,736
The pain I feel from the knives
that are digging into my flesh...

731
01:02:52,706 --> 01:02:54,706
is absolutely nothing...

732
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:59,476
compared to the pain I will
feel if that woman ever dies.

733
01:03:01,876 --> 01:03:04,245
I just want to know
more about you.

734
01:03:05,586 --> 01:03:06,785
Then don't die.

735
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,356
Please stay alive.

736
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:14,296
Please stay alive
until I arrive.

737
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:17,026
I often had nightmares.

738
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:20,765
And every time I did, no
one was ever there for me.

739
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:22,736
I was used to that.

740
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:25,465
But now...

741
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:28,376
So enjoy some normalcy
in the rest of your life.

742
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,135
I'll make sure of it.

743
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:32,905
Why am I waiting for you?

744
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,646
Lee Yeon. Lee Yeon!

745
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:25,026
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

746
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:26,726
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

747
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:28,535
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

748
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:06,436
Please don't die.

749
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:11,745
Don't die...

750
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,245
because of me.

751
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:44,745
I found you.

752
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,115
Please be reincarnated.

753
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:56,856
I promise to find you.

754
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:55,576
I also...

755
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,686
waited for you.
