7
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,274
It's empty.

8
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:09,022
- What?
- Everyone's gone.

9
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,768
What do mean?

10
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,826
It's as if the entire
village vanished.

11
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:15,708
Not even a human
shadow is in sight.

<font color="#00ff00">EOHWA SUPERMARKET</font>

13
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:03,648
- Did you check the restroom?
- There's nothing.

14
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:06,087
- What?
- The dead body from yesterday...

15
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,158
is gone.

16
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:11,158
It became a desert
island overnight.

17
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,428
They weren't taken
against their will.

18
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:16,298
I see no signs of a struggle
or hesitation marks.

19
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,867
Maybe they went on a group tour.

20
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:20,467
And took the corpse with them?

21
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,867
They left behind their
wallets and other valuables.

22
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,007
They just vanished.

23
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,507
Where could they have gone?

24
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,247
They vanished?

25
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:34,548
Right. 22 homes?

26
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,188
All 41 of the villagers?

27
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,488
Got it. I'll send some backup,

28
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,257
so call me if you find
anyone dead or injured.

29
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,387
Sure.

30
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,228
What is it?

31
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,527
That.

32
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,837
Since when have
those been there?

33
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:12,518
It's said...

34
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,157
that bamboos can
call the spirits.

35
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,527
Is it true?

36
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:17,928
They're hollow,

37
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:20,657
making them the perfect
guesthouse for lost spirits.

38
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:26,698
Doesn't it look like someone
formed some sort of path?

39
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,738
For the Dragon King.

40
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,768
I came across one while
covering a Jeju folk festival.

41
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,678
It's the path greeting
the Dragon King, right?

42
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,678
It is, but the direction is off.

43
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,377
Now that you mention it,

44
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,717
it faces southwest.

45
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,148
Gwimunbang.

The bearing that lets
those evil in and out.

48
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,488
So this door wasn't set up...

49
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,928
to welcome the real Dragon King.

50
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:04,168
I'm Hyeonuiong of the
Afterlife Immigration Office.

51
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,478
How's King Hades?

52
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:10,347
I just called because we
need more shroud today.

53
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,877
Would an express
delivery be possible?

54
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:14,548
Okay.

55
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:15,717
All right.

56
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,548
Have a good one. Bye.

57
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,527
- What did you find out?
- I don't get why this is happening.

58
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,168
Are you sure it's an Imoogi?

59
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,967
Are you not able to
see where it went?

60
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,067
Did it use a talisman? It
didn't leave a single trace.

61
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,437
Shouldn't we tell Yeon?

62
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:39,907
Stop causing a fuss.

63
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,978
Yeon should never find out.

64
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,048
- But...
- Shut your mouth.

65
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,108
Okay.

66
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,157
I wonder if this was why...

67
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:57,958
I couldn't foresee
Yeon's future.

68
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:04,268
Hey.

69
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,568
I actually heard something
weird past midnight yesterday.

70
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:10,967
What did you hear?

71
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:12,938
It sounded like a crying baby.

72
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:18,308
Be more specific.

73
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,777
It was a little over 2am.

74
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,417
I woke up because I got thirsty.

75
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:29,527
At first, I thought
it was a stray cat.

76
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,198
But it wasn't. I'm sure it
sounded like a crying baby.

77
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,427
There were no pregnant
ladies on this island.

78
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,297
All the old ladies are over 70.

79
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,737
- What was the time again?
- It was 2:40am.

80
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:45,777
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

81
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:48,607
The clocks weren't working.

82
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,648
Both the wall clock
and table clock.

83
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:57,287
My watch isn't working
either. It's exactly 2:40am.

84
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,058
It's the hour of the cow.

It's when the door to
the other world opens up.

87
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,758
I wonder what
happened last night.

<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 4: THE VERGE OF DEATH</font>

89
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:34,787

- Happy birthday Dear Yu Ri.

90
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,927
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you.

91
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:42,198
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Yu Ri.

92
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:44,427
- Here. This is from me.
- And this is from me.

93
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,277
Thanks, you guys.

94
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,177
- Do you like it?
- Of course.

95
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:59,217
I'm so happy that I might cry.

96
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,188
Sweetheart, when are you
going to get married?

97
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,087
She's still young.

98
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:11,558
- She's 24. That's not young.
- She's 25.

99
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,998
No, she was 24.

100
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,438
Dad, do you have dementia?

101
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:25,607
Didn't that accident
occur when she was 24?

102
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,677
She was a senior in college.

103
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,148
What accident?

104
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,347
Yu Ri went to Nepal
to go trekking.

105
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,248
But she fell and died.

106
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:38,148
Honey, why would you say
something so horrible?

107
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,258
I'm serious. I'm sure I saw...

108
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:43,787
her body back then.

109
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,227
Dad, I told you to forget all
those unnecessary memories.

110
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,568
Who... Who are you?

111
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,277
Why are you buying
me a cell phone?

112
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,948
Because my little brother
stole your cell phone.

113
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,248
I'm not being nice. I'm
just doing what I should.

114
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:07,948
Keep in mind that you need to
use follow the 48 month-plan.

115
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,518
You can pay for the penalty.

116
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:11,518
I downloaded an application.

117
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,518
Don't answer any calls from
unknown numbers or my brother.

118
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,787
I'm surprised you're a techie.

119
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,427
I realized it's pretty difficult
to keep things traditional.

120
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:23,227
What?

121
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:24,498
Around this time last year,

122
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:26,398
I got a call from Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

123
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,467
Someone illegally used my name!

124
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,568
Don't tell me it was
a voice phishing scam.

125
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:35,107
I ripped off the ears of the guy
who stole 20,000 dollars from me.

126
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,277
But that's still not enough.
I can't sleep at night.

127
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,118
Here.

128
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,047
Give me your number.

129
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,087
You told me not to answer any
calls from unknown numbers.

130
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,628
Don't you know
enough about me now?

131
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,758
There are a few things I
didn't get to ask last night.

132
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,967
And I want to know more
about you while I'm at it.

133
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:02,768
Fine. You're very consistent.

134
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:04,568
People tend to
say that about me.

135
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,008
I'll see you again.

136
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:28,898
It's me, your beloved daughter.

137
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:53,687
What was your wish?

138
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:58,287
I wanted my daughter
to come back to life.

139
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,898
I gave you what you wanted.

140
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:05,998
Who is she?

141
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,297
She's my daughter, Ki Yu Ri.

142
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,268
She's 25 years old,

143
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,577
and she's going to take
over my department store.

144
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:17,177
Okay, you guys can go now.

145
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:24,047
Rang, I missed you.

146
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,088
Did you meet the vet?

147
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,018
- Yes.
- How was he?

148
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,427
He was a lot cuter
than I had imagined.

149
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:34,527
He got scared as soon
as he saw my gun.

150
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,067
You can keep that. He'll come
for it at the right time.

151
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,067
What should I do
then? Can I kill him?

152
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,238
Yu Ri.

153
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,508
Do you know when
clams taste the best?

154
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:47,738
- No, not really.
- When peach blossoms bloom.

155
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:51,848
That's when the shells become
hard and the flesh becomes juicy.

156
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:56,248
If you want the best ingredients,
you need to learn how to wait.

157
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,287
Treat him well, and
show him a good time.

158
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,827
Yeon really cares
a lot about him.

159
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:06,628
Okay.

160
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,728
Are you going somewhere?

161
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,827
Yeon is probably dying
to see me right now.

162
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,838
I should go greet him.

163
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:22,037
Why did you want to meet here?

164
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:25,047
I got curious. You
always spend time here.

165
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:27,817
Let me try your mint
chocolate ice cream.

166
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:28,878
Don't touch it.

167
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:33,287
Gosh, it tastes like
chocolate and toothpaste.

168
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:34,888
Why do you eat this?

169
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:39,427
I played along with your
nonsense, so tell me.

170
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,498
- Tell you what?
- The people on that island.

171
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:42,827
Where did they all go?

172
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,197
Who cares?

173
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,638
I know you don't
care about them.

174
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:53,407
From what I know, one
of them wasn't human.

175
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,508
I also heard a similar rumor...

176
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:00,018
saying something peculiar lives
inside the well in the mountain.

177
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,148
- What's that?
- Why?

178
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:07,988
Do you think it might be him?

179
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:10,927
The snake that took
your lady away from you?

180
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,697
I already killed that thing.

181
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,968
Life doesn't always
go as you planned.

182
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,567
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

183
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,277
But I know one thing for sure.

184
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:32,848
Your lady...

185
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,417
won't get to live a long
life this time either.

186
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,797
Have you ever heard of
"the vanishing effect"?

187
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,927
"Vanishing"? As in "Disappear"?

188
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,268
It's when someone suddenly
vanishes into thin air.

189
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,707
And something similar also
happened on an island...

190
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,008
in North Carolina.

191
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,878
In 1590, every single person
on this island disappeared.

192
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:07,047
All their belongings
remained the same.

193
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,417
Only the people disappeared.

194
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,527
Why did you become so messed up?

195
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:20,128
You were the one who abandoned
the forest to protect your love.

196
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,827
600 years have
passed since then.

197
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:24,098
And I spent all those
years cursing you.

198
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,437
What do you want me to do?

199
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,277
There's only one way to stop me.

200
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,248
Kill me here and now...

201
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,447
with your own two hands.

202
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:52,057
Kill me.

203
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:55,457
Just like how you came
to hunt me down that day.

204
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,817
Please... Please don't kill me.

205
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:21,618
Please don't kill me.

206
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,628
Rang.

207
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,338
Yeon.

208
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:46,077
Is it really you?

209
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,628
How long has it
been? You were alive.

210
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,338
I didn't hear from you since
you went to the Samdo River,

211
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,697
so I thought you had died.

212
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,407
I've missed you.

213
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,707
I've missed you so much, Yeon.

214
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,547
Why didn't you come for me?

215
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:20,947
I did.

216
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,187
I did,

217
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,588
but I couldn't find you.

218
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,118
I lost you.

219
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:33,358
After you left,

220
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,957
people set fire to the mountain.

221
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,498
I wanted to wait for you there,

222
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,838
but it was too hot and scary.

223
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:44,768
Is that why you killed
all these people?

224
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,677
Even the innocent ones?

225
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,518
They're sinning by just
being alive and breathing.

226
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,388
I just wiped out a village.

227
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:02,118
They knelt at my feet and
begged for their lives.

228
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:04,488
I see.

229
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,868
You couldn't walk past
an injured dog before.

230
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,407
You've changed so much.

231
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:18,037
Join me.

232
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,307
Let's teach the
humans who we are.

233
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:28,618
Rang.

234
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,417
Yes?

235
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:41,858
Raise...

236
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:49,907
Raise your sword.

237
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,108
What are you saying, Yeon?

238
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,407
It's the order of
the afterlife judges.

239
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,527
Lee Rang, who murdered
countless innocent lives...

240
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,598
shall pay...

241
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,437
for his sins today
with his life.

242
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:54,138
You're a real jerk.

243
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,338
You dumped your
brother for a girl,

244
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,338
then you betrayed him to
bring your numbers up.

245
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:01,977
As long as you save up your miles
and get her reincarnated, right?

246
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,848
I survived only because
you missed a vital point.

247
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,578
If I had died then, I'd
be burning right now...

248
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,318
in the Underworld of
the Fiery Cauldron.

249
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,417
What? You can't get
yourself to do it twice?

250
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,858
Kill me.

251
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,358
That's the only way
your woman can live.

252
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,407
Fine. It wouldn't be so bad
to end your life early...

253
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:32,767
rather than live
recklessly like this.

254
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:36,778
Do it.

255
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:06,382
Why?

256
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,513
Why can't you do it?

257
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,453
Stop acting like
an abandoned child.

258
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,552
You're not a kid anymore.

259
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,332
I can do it.

260
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,003
Do you know why I'm holding
back? Because I want to see...

261
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,403
the look on your face
when she dies again...

262
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,673
before your very eyes.

263
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,342
No matter how weak you act,

264
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:35,842
I know this isn't
your true self.

265
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:38,582
What?

266
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:40,913
Bye.

267
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:57,163
Anyway, please make sure
the media doesn't find out.

268
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,532
I can keep my mouth shut,

269
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,532
but will the families of
the missing people do so?

270
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:02,933
There aren't any.

271
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,542
What?

272
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,473
They don't have any
families or relatives.

273
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,112
- All 41 people from the village?
- Yes.

274
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:12,342
What's even eerie is, they weren't
even natives to the island.

275
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:14,413
- Then?
- They all migrated together...

276
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,753
sometime in the 1950s.

277
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,822
On the same day,
on the same boat.

278
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,903
You don't know what it feels like
to live with your direct supervisor.

279
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:33,872
Shin Ju.

280
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:36,003
Don't you ever get married.

281
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:38,102
I don't have anyone anyway.

282
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:41,473
Marriage for a man is like scoring
into your own goal. Heed my words.

283
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:43,042
Your brother-in-law
is King Hades.

284
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,183
It would at least be a winning
goal during stoppage time.

285
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,013
Are you a ref?

286
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,913
Are you the judge of my life?

287
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,753
Oh, come on.

288
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:53,153
Why are you picking on Shin Ju?

289
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:55,893
Don't you get
married again either.

290
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,862
Stay... Stay a widow forever.

291
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:01,233
How could you say that?

292
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,763
I would've punched you already
if it weren't for King Hades.

293
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:08,433
How did you two meet, anyway?

294
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,102
It was a crime of sorts.

295
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,782
A long time ago,
my wife peeped...

296
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:19,213
while I bathed in a stream.

297
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:22,052
It was love at first sight.

298
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:25,822
Correct. I've got
a rocking body.

299
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,592
Wait. Then...

300
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,663
did she ask you out first?

301
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,393
I was abducted that night.

302
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:35,362
She threw a sack over my
head and carried me off.

303
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,203
- What?
- She sat me down...

304
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:38,233
and said two things.

305
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:41,403
"Will you live with me
or go to the Underworld?"

306
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,503
"Will you sleep with me
or go to the Underworld?"

307
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:47,673
So I slept with her.

308
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,013
How dare you?

309
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,183
How dare you forget your
position and kill a person?

310
00:21:58,022 --> 00:21:59,082
That shaman?

311
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:01,723
She looked fine on the outside, but
she was clearly due to die soon.

312
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,263
Regardless, she was
not on the list!

313
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,733
It was an emergency.

314
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:10,132
Your punishment has been
decided. What were you thinking?

315
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:11,933
I'll gladly accept
any punishment.

316
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:15,433
So don't be so obvious
about worrying about me.

317
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:18,203
Was it because of that girl?

318
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:22,072
Did you finally find her?

319
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:31,822
But...

320
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:34,292
she doesn't have the fox
bead that I gave her.

321
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,463
You must have the wrong girl.

322
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,733
But she looks too much like her.

323
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,503
Her face.

324
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:44,862
I'll protect you.

325
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,102
Her voice.

326
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,602
It's burning hot.

327
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,842
Even that jerk's scales that covered
A Eum's body just before she died.

328
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:52,403
Stop here.

329
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:56,812
- What do you mean?
- A fox and a human cannot be.

330
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,683
Your obsession will
bring about calamity.

331
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:03,253
To both you and
her who was reborn.

332
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,393
I don't wish for
anything that grand.

333
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:12,263
Then?

334
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,032
Even if we live for
thousands of years,

335
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,332
We all have a time we cherish.

336
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:21,332
The era which we
loved above all.

337
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:27,243
In your case, it was the 80s.

338
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,243
It's when you
discovered a new hobby.

339
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,743
<font color="#00ff00">"FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE"</font>

340
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,562
When Leslie Cheung passed away,

341
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,384
you drank for three
days straight.

342
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,723
So?

343
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:48,163
That's how it was for me too.

344
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,473
The time I cherish is when she
breathed the same air as mine.

345
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,173
Even if she is reborn,

346
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:05,542
she wouldn't be the same person.

347
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:06,612
I don't care.

348
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:10,183
All I want...

349
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:14,522
is to see her gradually grow
old while experiencing...

350
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,263
the joy, anger, sorrow,
and pleasure in life.

351
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,163
In order for that to happen,
there's a job I must do.

352
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:34,572
- Yes?
- What's up?

353
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,483
Oh, well... I'm about
to have my meal.

354
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,112
- Did you receive your order?
- Yes. Why?

355
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,282
Send it back to the kitchen.

356
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:43,413
What are you getting at?

357
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,253
I'm asking you out for a meal.

358
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,493
Granny, I'll be
back after I eat.

359
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:52,562
Hey!

360
00:24:53,322 --> 00:24:54,963
The Laws of the Afterlife
isn't some joke.

361
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:57,332
But I haven't been able to
take even a sip of water today.

362
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:59,203
This is the last
time I'll be lenient.

363
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,673
You are to be back
before midnight.

364
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:07,213
Wait. Didn't you see someone
suspicious leaving the island?

365
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:11,643
- I'm not your personal dashcam!
- I knew you'd say that.

366
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,082
You never help me out.

367
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:43,042
- You're here.
- Hey.

368
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:46,013
- Come on in.
- Sure.

369
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:49,683
- Should I close the gate?
- Yes, please.

370
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:50,852
Then I will.

371
00:25:57,993 --> 00:26:00,532
- Hold on. Did you...
- Yes, I made it all myself.

372
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,362
I'm good at pretty
much everything.

373
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:04,163
Not what's most
important though.

374
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:06,903
Modesty doesn't put
food on the table. I do.

375
00:26:08,203 --> 00:26:10,342
By the way, what's
that behind your back?

376
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,003
- It looks like flowers.
- It's not.

377
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:14,812
Muster up the courage
to hand it over.

378
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:25,223
It's a bundle of
mugwort, not flowers.

379
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:29,393
I'll be in debt if I
accept the meal for free...

380
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:30,622
and I couldn't be bothered.

381
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,092
Do you like it?

382
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,763
I'll sit here.

383
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,403
Talk about a soulless response.

384
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:40,973
It's not what you'd expect
as a housewarming gift.

385
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:43,433
Should I put this in water
or prep it for a meal?

386
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:47,612
When no life was present
on a land that was nuked,

387
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,372
mugwort was first to grow.

388
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:50,713
It's just like you, right?

389
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:53,683
Yes, it's my cup of tea.

390
00:26:57,253 --> 00:27:00,493
- What are you doing?
- Animals like being patted.

391
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:11,562
My dog usually likes it
when I pat it this way.

392
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:23,842
There.

393
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:35,052
It's good.

394
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,062
Help yourself to more.

395
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,362
Why the sudden change
of heart though?

396
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,332
Humans...

397
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,542
offer food to other people when
expressing their gratitude.

398
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:56,612
You saved my life twice already,
but this ordinary meal...

399
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:59,082
was the only way I could
somewhat repay the favor.

400
00:28:04,153 --> 00:28:05,382
It's special enough.

401
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,393
At least to me today.

402
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,739
<font color="#00ff00">"YEOU GOGAE ACCIDENT, A PROFESSOR
AND DOCTOR COUPLE VANISHED"</font>

403
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,782
I see you still live here.

404
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,753
It's the same for people
with lost family members.

405
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:44,522
We can't easily move.

406
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,993
We stay in the same house
so that our families...

407
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:50,332
can find their way back.

408
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:54,572
It must've been lonely to
live alone in his big house.

409
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,072
Why are you laughing?

410
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:00,943
Because I can't cry.

411
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,513
Hearing that I
could've been lonely...

412
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,483
makes me wonder...

413
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:09,552
if that's how it was
for me growing up.

414
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,622
They must've been great parents.

415
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,723
They were.

416
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,763
If only they were mean though.

417
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:25,403
If they were, I
might've been able...

418
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,973
to forget about them and
move on with my life.

419
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:55,233
Doing this sucks
the tears back in.

420
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:59,703
It's a secret I acquired at
nine after losing my parents.

421
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,413
You'll be able to
find your parents.

422
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:16,253
I'll make sure of it.

423
00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:20,953
So enjoy some normalcy
in the rest of your life.

424
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,163
I'm talking about the boring...

425
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:26,663
but warm life others enjoy.

426
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:42,812
About that first
love you mentioned...

427
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:43,872
In your dreams.

428
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:46,743
My first love was like
a delicate flower.

429
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,082
And I'm like a weed.

430
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,552
I'm like mugwort that
grows on irradiated soil.

431
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,923
For a mugwort, you grew up fine.

432
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,203
Thank you for what you
did on Eohwa Island.

433
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,203
Don't mention it.

434
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:16,372
When I was on the brink of death
after being sliced by Yeon,

435
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,282
you saved me.

436
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:35,592
That's what I call fate.

437
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:39,263
So how's the kid?

438
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:42,332
It's asleep.

439
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:46,102
You're admirable, I have to say.

440
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:47,872
It astounds me to know...

441
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,473
how you devoted 600 years
of your life to serve it.

442
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,542
Because I'm human.

443
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:55,612
An ordinary human being...

444
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:58,453
who desperately wants to
find a way to stay alive.

445
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:06,092
I've never come across anyone
with a decent ending...

446
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,693
who drew power from my
realm to stay alive.

447
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,532
So where do you go from here?

448
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:16,973
I'll feed, let it sleep,
and wait for it to grow.

449
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,443
I'll look forward to it.

450
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,542
When the protagonist falls in
love with his long-lost love,

451
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,042
their tragic story will
be repeated once again.

452
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:34,653
A funeral hall?

453
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,393
- Must you go there?
- Why?

454
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,862
It's not the best of time
to go to such a place.

455
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:42,532
What do you mean by that?

456
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,062
Why do you think
your ancestors...

457
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,473
showered and sprinkled salt
after coming back from a funeral?

458
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,832
It's because evil spirits
get attached to you there.

459
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:53,943
I'm grateful for your concern,
but I must be present.

460
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,582
You've already stepped
foot into my realm.

461
00:32:58,882 --> 00:33:00,983
So you're worried that petty
spirits will latch onto me?

462
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:04,653
Whatever it is, what you can
see can also see you back.

463
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:08,022
On top of that, I'll be
leaving Seoul for a few days.

464
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,322
Are you going on a trip?

465
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:14,092
I guess you can say it's
something like that.

466
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,733
- So...
- I don't want to avoid it.

467
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,832
Especially if I'll be living
in that world from now on.

468
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,372
Wait here.

469
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,842
What?

470
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,713
Here.

471
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:39,852
It's a bag filled with red
beans that add up to your age.

472
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:41,693
Don't lose it. Keep it
with you at all times.

473
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:43,753
Is it like a talisman?

474
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:46,963
It's old school, but it'll last
a day or two since I made it.

475
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:49,963
Thanks.

476
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:52,263
I'll be off now.
Have a fun trip.

477
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:53,703
Okay.

478
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:06,782
For some strange reason,
I can't seem to leave.

479
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,683
I wonder if it's okay to
leave her all by herself.

480
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,802
What's your favorite movie?

481
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,842
"Toy Story 3". Why?

482
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,172
<font color="#00ff00">- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?
- "TOY STORY 3". WHY?</font>

483
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,373
I just want to know
more about you.

484
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:51,763
Bye.

485
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:53,763
Do you have the red bean bag?

486
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:56,732
Yes.

487
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,152
You brat.

488
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,752
I thought you weren't
going to come.

489
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,822
I heard you never once cried.

490
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,822
You really are something.

491
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,473
I'm sorry for being late.

492
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,212
My mom...

493
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,643
asked me to take her
to a hanbok store...

494
00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:47,212
because they say you
live a long life...

495
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,752
if you buy your shroud in
advance on a leap year.

496
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:51,683
But I kept postponing it. And
in the end, I never took her.

497
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:54,523
Every time she called,

498
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:58,362
I always hung up on
her saying I'm busy.

499
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:01,763
Last week,

500
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:05,333
she made my favorite,
dongchimi for me.

501
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,802
But I didn't go
because I overslept.

502
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:12,643
You really were a bad daughter.

503
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:15,243
I know, right?

504
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,243
Yes.

505
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,252
My mom made the best dongchimi.

506
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:27,152
But I can't eat it anymore.

507
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:31,623
Cry all you want.

508
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:36,063
If you hold it in now,
it'll leave a scar.

509
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,402
Where is it this time?

510
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:46,973
Send me somewhere
warm if you can.

511
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,212
I'm old now, so I
get cold easily.

512
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:50,942
I said I get cold easily.

513
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:55,282
Here's a message from
the afterlife judges.

514
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,152
"Lee Yeon, former mountain
spirit of Baekdudaegan."

515
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,353
"Based on Article 24
of the criminal law,"

516
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:05,293
"you deserve to be sent to
the First Underworld..."

517
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:07,962
"for having killed
a human being."

518
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:11,002
"However, we take into consideration
all the lives you’ve saved,"

519
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:13,563
"so you will be put on
probation for a week."

520
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:17,032
Wait a minute. "A
week"? That's too long.

521
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:19,672
"However, during that week,"

522
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:22,973
"you will live inside
a human body..."

523
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,482
"and feel the pain of life,"

524
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:27,583
"old age, sickness, and death."

525
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:28,813
What the...

526
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,020
<font color="#00ff00">"DIRECTOR KI YU RI WILL QUICKLY
TAKE OVER MOZE DEPARTMENT STORE"</font>

527
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,942
"Ki Yu Ri"?

528
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:13,523
You're the necklace thief.

529
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:16,092
- Hi.
- How did you find me here?

530
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,362
I thought you'd come for
this, but you didn't.

531
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,732
That's because you
carry around a gun.

532
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,773
Relax.

533
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:26,342
I'm not armed today.

534
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:27,773
What do you want?

535
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,273
Let's have fun.

536
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:44,623
How is she?

537
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:47,362
I made her cry a bucket,
and now she's dizzy.

538
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:52,163
- Make sure she eats this.
- Got it.

539
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:57,132
The yukgaejang here
tastes pretty nice.

540
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,243
What are you doing here?

541
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,782
Stop overreacting and sit down.

542
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,643
I gave her more money
than you for consolation.

543
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:10,583
Sit down...

544
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:13,683
if you don't want your friend
to die just like her mother.

545
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:29,973
What do you want?

546
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:32,103
Are things going well with Yeon?

547
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:34,842
Yes, we're really
hitting it off...

548
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,683
seeing that his one and only
brother keeps visiting me like this.

549
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,382
Aren't you scared of me?

550
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:45,052
I am scared. I heard a guy who
has an inferiority complex...

551
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,252
is pretty much like
a ticking bomb.

552
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,453
You got that right.

553
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,223
Why do you hate your
older brother so much?

554
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:55,893
I'm just bored.

555
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,163
You're lying.

556
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:04,072
I bet you really
liked your brother.

557
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:07,342
That's why you're
being like this.

558
00:40:22,393 --> 00:40:24,993
You weren't lying when you told me
you got smuggled here from Russia.

559
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:26,123
What are you doing?

560
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:28,532
I'm a vet.

561
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,333
That scar on your body.

562
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,232
I saw something similar on animals
that were locked up in zoos.

563
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,973
You were abused by a
human being, weren't you?

564
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:39,603
Don't look at me like
that. It's annoying.

565
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:42,513
- I'm sorry.
- Don't even apologize.

566
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,413
I'm never going to give
you back your necklace.

567
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,112
It's very precious to me.

568
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:50,882
That's why I took it from you.

569
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,982
Who is it? Who's
making you do this?

570
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,893
Try taking back your
necklace yourself.

571
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,192
Then I'll tell you.

572
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,632
A long time ago, there
was a mountain spirit...

573
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,732
who abandoned his own mountain.

574
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:15,273
All the humans who used
to come and make wishes...

575
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:19,313
set the mountain on fire to
get rid of all the foxes.

576
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:22,813
Every living soul
burned to death.

577
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,482
The puppies I raised
like my own...

578
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:28,953
all turned into charcoal.

579
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:31,962
Did that happen...

580
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,732
because of his first love?

581
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,032
Yeon thinks you are
her reincarnation.

582
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,802
That's why he killed the shaman
even though he was aware...

583
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:45,703
of the consequences.

584
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:48,913
"The consequences"?

585
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,482
Where is Yeon right now?

586
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,353
In a place I'm pretty sure
that has bad reception.

587
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:04,530
<font color="#00ff00">THE SNOW MOUNTAIN PRISON</font>

588
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:35,853
Where is he?

589
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,002
You don't need to know that.

590
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:50,502
If you want to live,

591
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:53,002
you'd better not
fall asleep tonight.

592
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:08,052
Look at room number six.

593
00:43:08,623 --> 00:43:11,822
Why are there so many
people there at this hour?

594
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,032
They all look like
small children.

595
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,663
Why are you so interested
in other people's business?

596
00:43:54,002 --> 00:43:57,703
Time in the Underworld flows
differently from the living realm.

597
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:02,513
One day in this world is
seven years in the Underworld.

598
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:05,413
You do not eat.

599
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:08,453
You do not sleep.

600
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:11,552
You cannot...

601
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:13,583
even die.

602
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:24,887
<font color="#00ff00">"A BETTER TOMORROW"</font>

603
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:27,803
That's how it was for me too.

604
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:31,426
The time I cherish is when she
breathed the same air as mine.

605
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:33,473
I'll gladly accept
any punishment.

606
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:36,813
All I want is to see her
gradually grow old...

607
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:40,504
while experiencing the joy, anger,
sorrow, and pleasure in life.

608
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:46,123
You fool.

609
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:08,942
The phone is turned off. Your call
is being forwarded to voicemail.

610
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:11,072
Please leave a message
after the tone.

611
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:41,543
Is it a blackout?

612
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:08,302
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

613
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:30,293
Hi.

614
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:35,063
You must be sisters.

615
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:37,993
How old are you?

616
00:46:40,862 --> 00:46:42,902
What are you doing here?

617
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,942
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

618
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:47,002
- Have you seen our dad?
- Have you seen our dad?

619
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:48,513
Did you lose your dad?

620
00:46:49,413 --> 00:46:50,543
Which room was he in?

621
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,422
Do you want me to
find him for you?

622
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:06,023
Let's go.

623
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:09,532
What's this?

624
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:14,902
Why are your shoes mismatched?

625
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:17,873
Ms. Nam!

626
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:21,572
Hey.

627
00:47:24,982 --> 00:47:26,083
She finished the rice cakes.

628
00:47:26,712 --> 00:47:27,743
Good work.

629
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,013
Ms. Kim told us to go home.

630
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,583
She wants to rest too.

631
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,382
She did? Hold on.

632
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:38,723
Where did the kids go?

633
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:41,063
- Kids?
- Yes.

634
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:42,893
They were just here.

635
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:45,263
They probably went with
their parents. Let's go.

636
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,132
Okay.

637
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:55,473
Are you taking a cab?
I'll drop you off.

638
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,842
No. I'm exhausted,

639
00:47:57,973 --> 00:48:00,643
but my mom said to walk
around for a while...

640
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:02,052
and shake off all
the evil spirits.

641
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:04,853
She must believe in bad luck.

642
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,683
She goes to church, but
she's so superstitious.

643
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,692
- See you tomorrow.
- Good job today.

644
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:28,313
When did this...

645
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:12,822
Ms. Nam!

646
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:20,763
She lost the talisman
that I gave her.

647
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,833
Was it Rang? Or...

648
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:29,103
Granny.

649
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:31,032
I need to talk to you.

650
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,043
I know you hear me.

651
00:49:36,313 --> 00:49:37,373
Untie me.

652
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,183
Granny. Please.

653
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:42,252
Untie me!

654
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:45,822
Untie me! Quickly!

655
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:48,652
Untie me already!

656
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:52,563
Darn it. Darn it, Granny!

657
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:00,532
Why are you being so loud?

658
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:06,203
Granny. I need to get out
of here. Untie me. Quickly.

659
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,413
You punk! Don't you know
where you are right now?

660
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,712
I'll go to the
Underworld of Knives.

661
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,743
That's where I was headed if
my sentence wasn't reduced.

662
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:17,683
Then I can get out
within the day.

663
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:19,953
Or you may never get out...

664
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:22,223
in that body.

665
00:50:29,462 --> 00:50:30,493
I don't care.

666
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:59,063
Here. Do you feel better?

667
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:01,163
Yes.

668
00:51:04,163 --> 00:51:05,402
What happened to me?

669
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,462
You fainted outside
the funeral home.

670
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:11,473
- I'm cold.
- You're cold?

671
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:23,013
Did something happen there?

672
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:28,223
I saw some young kids.

673
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:30,252
Twice.

674
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:31,822
What did they look like?

675
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:33,763
They were sisters.

676
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,192
They were wearing
pretty dresses...

677
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,203
and mismatched shoes.

678
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:40,862
Were they ghosts?

679
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:44,072
- What?
- When ghosts imitate humans,

680
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:46,543
they do the opposite
in certain things.

681
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,513
- You don't believe in ghosts.
- Hold on.

682
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:56,054
<font color="#00ff00">"STRANGE TALES OF JOSEON",
"COLLECTION OF KOREAN LEGENDS"</font>

683
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:01,782
I looked into it,

684
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:05,152
and that funeral home used
to be a children's cemetery.

685
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,063
A children's cemetery?

686
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:10,163
A cemetery just for children?

687
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:13,663
Yes. They tore it down and
built the funeral home.

688
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,603
- But Jae Hwan.
- Yes?

689
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,243
Why do you keep...

690
00:52:21,002 --> 00:52:23,013
holding the book upside down?

691
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:40,862
She caught us.

692
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:12,491
<font color="#00ff00">THE UNDERWORLD OF KNIVES</font>

693
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,112
Cross the bridge.

694
00:53:36,652 --> 00:53:38,152
Take your first step...

695
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,922
and you won't be able to
leave until you cross it.

696
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,063
Could I do it...

697
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:48,732
in this physical state I'm in?

698
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:08,143
Whatever it is, what you can
see can also see you back.

699
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:11,552
It's a bag filled with red
beans that add up to your age.

700
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,683
Don't lose it. Keep it
with you at all times.

701
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,063
Yeon...

702
00:55:17,282 --> 00:55:19,252
Granny, see you
on the other end.

703
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:29,592
The sinner will cross
the Underworld of Knives!

704
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:37,316
My cell phone.

705
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:55,265
Who's there?

706
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,285
Two.

707
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:12,256
Three.

708
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,385
Four.

709
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:18,695
Five.

710
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:25,336
What do you want from me?

711
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:43,086
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

712
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:45,825
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

713
00:57:46,126 --> 00:57:49,095
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

714
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:52,026
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

715
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:54,626
- Give up your body. We want it.
- Give up your body. We want it.

716
00:57:54,626 --> 00:57:57,166
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

717
01:02:16,256 --> 01:02:17,726
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

718
01:02:17,956 --> 01:02:20,095
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

719
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,095
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

720
01:02:22,095 --> 01:02:24,836
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

721
01:02:40,945 --> 01:02:41,986
Thanks, Yeon.

722
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:45,956
The 9-year-old me and
the 30-year-old me...

723
01:02:46,385 --> 01:02:47,856
both lived thanks to you.

724
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:51,495
You see,

725
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:56,296
I may not be able to kick
butt and control the weather,

726
01:02:57,836 --> 01:03:01,035
but I'll return
the favor someday.

727
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:03,476
I promised you...

728
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:05,405
that I will...

729
01:03:06,646 --> 01:03:07,976
protect you.

730
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:09,345
Your lady...

731
01:03:09,715 --> 01:03:11,745
won't get to live a long
life this time either.

732
01:03:16,555 --> 01:03:17,785
I don't care who she is.

733
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:20,456
I don't care whether or not she's
the person I've been looking for.

734
01:03:21,686 --> 01:03:24,256
None of that matters anymore.

735
01:03:26,066 --> 01:03:27,896
All I know is one thing.

736
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:32,736
The pain I feel from the knives
that are digging into my flesh...

737
01:03:34,706 --> 01:03:36,706
is absolutely nothing...

738
01:03:38,876 --> 01:03:41,476
compared to the pain I will
feel if that woman ever dies.

739
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:46,245
I just want to know
more about you.

740
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:48,785
Then don't die.

741
01:03:50,885 --> 01:03:52,356
Please stay alive.

742
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:56,296
Please stay alive
until I arrive.

743
01:03:57,655 --> 01:03:59,026
I often had nightmares.

744
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:02,765
And every time I did, no
one was ever there for me.

745
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:04,736
I was used to that.

746
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:07,465
But now...

747
01:04:07,805 --> 01:04:10,376
So enjoy some normalcy
in the rest of your life.

748
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:12,135
I'll make sure of it.

749
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:14,905
Why am I waiting for you?

750
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:17,646
Lee Yeon. Lee Yeon!

751
01:05:05,296 --> 01:05:07,026
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

752
01:05:07,026 --> 01:05:08,726
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

753
01:05:08,925 --> 01:05:10,535
- Give up your body.
- Give up your body.

754
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,436
Please don't die.

755
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:53,745
Don't die...

756
01:05:55,075 --> 01:05:56,245
because of me.

757
01:06:25,675 --> 01:06:26,745
I found you.

758
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:33,115
Please be reincarnated.

759
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:38,856
I promise to find you.

760
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:37,576
I also...

761
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:45,686
waited for you.

762
