1
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,470
I guess you could say that
this was my golden days.

2
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,319
I was the master
of Baekdudaegan,

3
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,259
a mountain spirit who
controlled the wind and rain.

4
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,189
I was a nine-tailed fox who
was on a different level...

5
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,759
compared to the
lame creatures...

6
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,499
you see on horror shows.

7
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Do you have a death wish?

8
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:07,580
That's odd.

9
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,089
My dog usually likes it
when I pat it this way.

10
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,589
What? How dare you! Do you
have any idea who I am?

11
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,390
You're a fox, aren't
you? Hi, I'm A Eum.

12
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:19,490
If I was given one
chance to change my past,

13
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,330
I'd choose this moment.

14
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,199
To make sure that
girl never finds me.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,270
Lee Yeon!

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,839
How is it that you never
get lost and come every day?

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,750
Here.

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,929
Some call it...

19
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,960
the biggest scandal
of Baekdudaegan.

20
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,630
The story of a mountain
spirit that fell for a human.

21
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,270
In this day and age,
I'd be criticized.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,339
But I couldn't care less.

23
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,140
I loved how she left
her trace in my woods.

24
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,570
You probably guessed already,

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,999
but this love story
has a tragic ending.

26
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,339
Someone stole her life.

27
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,270
Once she crosses Samdo River,
I'd never get to see her again.

28
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,080
I couldn't make her stay, but
I also couldn't let her go.

29
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:21,679
It's why I resorted
to abusing my powers.

30
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,010
How dare you!

31
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,149
Please be reincarnated.

32
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,750
I promise...

33
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,520
to find you.

34
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,159
Over the years, I came across
a few who did resemble her.

35
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,669
Excuse me.

36
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,140
What is it?

37
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,039
But none of them carried
the fox bead I gave her.

38
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,409
I apologize.

39
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,909
Are you A Eum?

40
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,190
You're not A Eum.

41
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,460
Forget everything you saw today.

42
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,770
If you don't,

43
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:00,839
I'll kill you.

44
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,739
I've been waiting for you.

45
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,849
Maybe I should've just
killed her then and there.

46
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,049
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 2: I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU</font>

47
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,099
Do you have a death wish?

48
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,909
I wouldn't be sipping tea here
if I was worried about that.

49
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,140
Would you like some?

50
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,750
Darn it.

51
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,190
After the stunt you pulled,

52
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,330
you're actually offering me tea?

53
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,760
Normally after that degree
of physical contact,

54
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,430
two people grab meals
and tea together.

55
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,529
The whole innocent act
doesn't go far these days.

56
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,609
Whether it does or not,

57
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,140
when you want something
from the other person,

58
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,310
it's only polite to
at least put down...

59
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,680
your pride or self-esteem.

60
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,609
Shouldn't you hear
me out first...

61
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,450
to know who's the
more desperate one?

62
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,820
If you don't manage
to change my mind,

63
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,919
you'll get what you
deserve for testing me.

64
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,320
It comes with a cost?

65
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:33,930
I'm going to take your eyes...

66
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,269
for having seen what you
never should've seen.

67
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,639
Deal.

68
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,249
<font color="#00ff00">EUNHA FUNERAL PARLOUR</font>

69
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,019
Do you want everyone to
know that you're a fox?

70
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,089
What?

71
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,259
- Your tail.
- Oh, gosh.

72
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,599
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,070
Are you Director Ki Yu
Ri from Moze Corporation?

74
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,099
Oh, yes.

75
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,910
I'm here to meet the families of
those who died in the bus accident.

76
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,780
I can't believe you
came all the way here.

77
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,849
Come this way.

78
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
<font color="#00ff00">EUNHA FUNERAL PARLOUR</font>

79
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,290
Sir, how much should a
conglomerate's daughter give...

80
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,719
to pay her condolences?

81
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:34,889
Why do you think we're here?

82
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,859
Because you killed them.

83
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,530
We came to enjoy their sadness.

84
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:46,030
We came to watch something nice,
so you should pay them enough.

85
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,710
Then I'll pay this much and
enjoy watching them all night.

86
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,519
You look exactly how
you looked 21 years ago.

87
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:09,019
I'm sure you're not going to ask
me how I manage to look so young.

88
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,160
- What are you?
- I'm a nine-tailed fox.

89
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,359
So you're a fox that's
pretending to be human.

90
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,599
What a lame reaction.

91
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,170
A normal human being...

92
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,609
- would scream...
- No.

93
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,379
I knew something like
you would exist...

94
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,979
somewhere out in this world.

95
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,780
I started directing a TV
show about urban legends...

96
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,080
so I could catch you myself.

97
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,719
You think you caught me, but it
might be the other way around.

98
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,920
First, let's hear
what you have to say.

99
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,969
21 years ago, we
met on Yeou Gogae.

100
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,739
What exactly
happened that night?

101
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,479
I followed the smell of blood, and
I ended up saving a little kid.

102
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,450
But I can see that
she's very ungrateful.

103
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,849
You saved me?

104
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,050
Why?

105
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,089
You just looked
like someone I knew.

106
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,259
But of course, I was mistaken.

107
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,729
What about my parents?

108
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,259
- They probably died.
- There were no bodies.

109
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,940
You're the only clue I have.

110
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,609
Please help.

111
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,009
I guess you lost your parents.

112
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:40,109
But I'm sorry to tell you
that I'm not interested...

113
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,749
in your memories of the past.

114
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,920
I'm sorry to say this,

115
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,859
but I'm sure you don't want
the world to know about you.

116
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,200
If things go as planned, the
show will air next Wednesday.

117
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,040
Your pretty face
won't get blurred out.

118
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,379
You sure held onto that flash
drive even while you were falling.

119
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,310
What are you trying to do?

120
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,650
You're more powerful than me,

121
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,119
and I obviously can't use the
law to make you cooperate.

122
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,420
But you see, I'm desperate.

123
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,830
I find this boring.

124
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,089
When you want to threaten someone,
you must be in a position of power.

125
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,960
Like this.

126
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,290
You're wrong.

127
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,660
I'm not threatening you.
I'm taking my chances.

128
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,210
When a fox is indebted to someone,
they must return the favour.

129
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,509
I don't care if
you're human or a fox.

130
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,019
I'll erase everything
I saw and heard.

131
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,259
But that is, only after
I find my parents.

132
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,670
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

133
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,599
I'm sorry for your loss.

134
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,109
Come this way.

135
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,580
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

136
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,170
What are you doing here?

137
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
- Who are you?
- Moze Department Store.

138
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,310
Don't you remember?

139
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,509
Oh, yes. I remember.

140
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,739
<font color="#00ff00">THE FOUNTAIN OF LUCK, MAKE
A WISH. IT WILL COME TRUE.</font>

141
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,950
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,359
It's okay.

143
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,089
Thank you.

144
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,920
Thank you.

145
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,589
- What did you wish for?
- What about you?

146
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,589
I have an older brother.

147
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,530
I want him to be miserable
for the rest of his life.

148
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,099
He's a real jerk.

149
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,729
I thought I might feel better
if I didn't see him around.

150
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,830
But I was wrong. I can't
seem to sleep at night.

151
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,999
I'm going to keep
bothering him...

152
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,540
until one of us dies.

153
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,210
What did you wish for?

154
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:34,650
I wished that I'd be able
to marry my girlfriend.

155
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,849
What a humble wish.

156
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,989
My parents won't ever
let me marry her.

157
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,089
Oh, dear. Do you
want me to help?

158
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,030
Who are you to help me?

159
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,200
I guess you could
say I'm a miracle.

160
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,280
Anyway, congratulations
on your wedding.

161
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,310
Your parents are no longer around
to disapprove of your girlfriend.

162
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,479
Was it you?

163
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,749
- Did you kill my mom and dad?
- Come on.

164
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,820
You have a crazy imagination.

165
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,089
Then what were
those coins about?

166
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,420
I guess you and I...

167
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,160
both got lucky.

168
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,700
She had this.

169
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,469
My goodness, an anesthetic?
She almost killed you!

170
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,009
Will you please sit
down? People are looking.

171
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,009
I'll make sure no one
takes anything again.

172
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,680
By the way, why do you think
her memory didn't get erased?

173
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:48,519
It's pretty rare, but our powers
don't work that well on some people.

174
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,420
For example, the female
shamans in the past.

175
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,089
But you just let her go?

176
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,389
And you even gave back her eye?

177
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,999
Rules are rules.

178
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:57,160
It's like we exist to repay
people for their kindness.

179
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,800
How long do we need to stick
to that old-fashioned custom?

180
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,269
We give back what we receive.

181
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:03,940
It's old-fashioned but romantic.

182
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:05,940
It shows a fox's dignity.

183
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,269
It's also a curse.

184
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,140
The bigger the debt,

185
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:11,950
the more we lose control
and become puppets.

186
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,719
Does she bother you...

187
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,019
because she looks like A Eum?

188
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,890
I've seen tons of people who looked
like her for hundreds of years.

189
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,229
I watched them
age and pass away.

190
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,529
And none of them were her.

191
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:30,430
How could the deities
be so indifferent?

192
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,269
Shin Ju, don't put on that face.
It makes you look really ugly.

193
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,809
Give her some.

194
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,950
Here.

195
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,749
Your dad is bored.

196
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:55,789
All done.

197
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,960
58 seconds. That was close.

198
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,860
That's enough. Now,
play with your dad.

199
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:03,559
I want to beat his record.

200
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,569
Okay, fine. Let's see if
you can beat my record.

201
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Ready, go.

202
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,809
Do you think you can
beat me this time?

203
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,670
Do you think so?

204
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,079
Ta-Da.

205
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,779
Mom, Dad cheated.

206
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,850
I'm really sorry.

207
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,479
Here's my apology.

208
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,120
Will you please accept it?
It's my handmade gimbap.

209
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,660
Please take it

210
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,090
- There you go.
- It's good, right?

211
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,100
Let's give your mom one too.
Here's my handmade gimbap.

212
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,329
It's very obvious you're
acting for the camera.

213
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,269
Was it very obvious?
How embarrassing.

214
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,039
Okay, one for me.

215
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,579
It's delicious.

216
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,710
I want a gift.

217
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,350
Okay. Look here. Look here.

218
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,989
That's my pretty girl.

219
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,769
Mom?

220
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,620
Okay. All of you died...

221
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,989
in a bus accident on Yeou Gogae.

222
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,360
I'm sure the grim reapers
briefed you on that already,

223
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,420
so I'll skip that.

224
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,930
Now, you will face the
afterlife judges...

225
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,729
and have the sins you committed
when you were alive judged.

226
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,670
Don't be scared. You have no
need if you were a good person.

227
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,170
You know King Hades, right?

228
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,279
My wife standing there is
King Hades' older sister.

229
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,110
She isn't scary, is she?

230
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,579
I'm terrified.

231
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,960
- That old fart.
- Have you seen from movies?

232
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,819
I should plow his tongue.

233
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,029
- He...
- We need to chat.

234
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:50,460
set up the five layers of
the Underworld quite well.

235
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,029
The main point is...

236
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,600
- Hello, Director Nam.
- Hello.

237
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm on the first floor.
Who wants coffee?

238
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,749
A Eum was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

239
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,890
I'm right.

240
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,090
Why do you want to find her now?

241
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,100
I want revenge.

242
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,600
I was sentenced to 600 years of
obligatory service because of...

243
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,329
Lying will land you
in the Underworld.

244
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,239
Do you want to be barbecued?

245
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:31,370
No. My hair is my life.
My red-brown hair.

246
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,880
You use to be on top of the world
as a mountain spirit. How did you...

247
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,110
Let's stop reminiscing
the old days.

248
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,979
- Where is she?
- How should I know?

249
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:43,620
You're clairvoyant. You see
everything that happens on earth.

250
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:49,719
Is it possible for
her to be reborn...

251
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,759
with the same face?

252
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,789
Hey. Reincarnation is random.

253
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,799
You should pray that
she isn't a boy.

254
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,170
Oh my gosh.

255
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,710
Boy or girl,
beautiful or ugly...

256
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,579
It doesn't matter.

257
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:17,150
As long as she isn't over 60.

258
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,620
Even if she is over 60, she's
still a baby compared to you.

259
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
No.

260
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,090
I don't want her
to die too soon...

261
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,489
after finally meeting her again.

262
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,069
Why do you look so exhausted?

263
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,509
I saw a dead body in my dream.

264
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,150
- It's an occupational hazard.
- You know,

265
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,049
I saw a woman in my dream...

266
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,819
wearing black mourning
garments and weeping so eerily.

267
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,249
- A virgin ghost?
- No.

268
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,420
It was you.

269
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,059
Hey. Don't jinx her.

270
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,029
- Was it really me?
- Yes.

271
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,269
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

272
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:09,100
Isn't that a bad dream?

273
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,269
You're so superstitious for someone
who doesn't believe in ghosts.

274
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,579
Don't mind him.

275
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,350
Losing a tooth in your dream also
means you may come into wealth.

276
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:20,249
Thank goodness.

277
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,979
Why you...

278
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,819
Excuse me. Will you
sell me that dream?

279
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,319
What?

280
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,519
I want to play the lottery.

281
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:35,900
Yeon.

282
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,029
- Don't look for her.
- What?

283
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,870
It may flip your destiny
upside down again.

284
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,110
I don't care.

285
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,549
Stop beating on your husband.

286
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,779
Cut back on delivery foods.
They're not good for your skin.

287
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,479
Here. I found this
on the way here.

288
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,749
I won't be here for a while.

289
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
Lipstick?

290
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,890
That's right. Resolve a
civil complaint for me.

291
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,670
Hey.

292
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,009
My parents' times
and dates of birth?

293
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,039
Okay. I'll text you.

294
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,920
<font color="#00ff00">DAD: NAM JONG SOO, MAY 3, 1958,
MOM: LEE YOUNG SUN, JUNE 26, 1960</font>

295
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,120
It's neither good
news nor bad news.

296
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,090
Let's meet.

297
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,329
Meet me at the restaurant
The Snail Bride at 1pm.

298
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,170
<font color="#00ff00">THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

300
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,420
Are you here to see Lee Yeon?

301
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,989
Yes.

302
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,190
This way.

303
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,559
Thank you.

304
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,559
You are blessed.

305
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,900
- Pardon?
- It's the first time...

306
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:19,729
he brought a person.

307
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:29,840
Hey.

308
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,950
About the times and dates of
birth that you asked for...

309
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:38,090
They're not on the list.

310
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,920
What does that mean?

311
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:41,620
As in, your parents aren't dead.

312
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:43,420
They're alive?

313
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,630
Where?

314
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,960
I don't know that much.

315
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,100
Why don't you eat?
You're the one paying.

316
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,850
It isn't the most
appetizing news, is it?

317
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,059
No, no. I'm very grateful.

318
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,069
Are you sure you're okay?

319
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,469
I'll find them.

320
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,710
I said they may be alive,

321
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,420
but no one believed me.

322
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,850
No one.

323
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:51,630
Sorry about the
anesthetic. I mean it.

324
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,969
You know how to apologize.

325
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:00,600
I really was despicable.

326
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,100
I won't ask for you
to be understanding.

327
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,840
No. I can understand.

328
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:11,880
And I do.

329
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:20,289
So?

330
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:23,819
Why?

331
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,829
Right? She has enteritis, right?

332
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,630
Did you have
tteokbokki yesterday?

333
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,700
What?

334
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,999
- Yes.
- She ate the leftovers.

335
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,999
But that was level-five spicy.

336
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,440
Kong.

337
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:38,870
I'll prescribe a laxative.

338
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,870
Starve her today. Give her
only water and medicine.

339
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,079
Don't get sassy with me.

340
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:48,219
No snacks either, obviously.

341
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,019
Can you tell what she ate
just by looking at her?

342
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,519
I speak their language.

343
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,860
- I don't mean to be rude, but...
- No rude questions.

344
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,430
Especially something
that involves my privacy.

345
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,870
Okay. I'll change the question.

346
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:12,039
There are other foxes in the
world in addition to you, right?

347
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,180
Do they all look like people?

348
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,390
They live in this city...

349
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,590
just like you people.

350
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,160
They worry about real
estate and economic crises.

351
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,229
How do you want to pay?

352
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,600
Here you go.

353
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:43,340
Pay cash and I'll
give you a discount.

354
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:46,069
Then tell me about Shin Don.

355
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,910
Is it true that the monk of
Goryeo Dynasty was a fox?

356
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:51,779
My gosh.

357
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,710
- What else?
- Pay up.

358
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,519
Right.

359
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,319
Are there other creatures too?

360
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,759
Of course. And they mostly live
where humans would never guess.

361
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,559
How was today's meal?

362
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,759
Not bad.

363
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:21,140
Let's grab some lunch?

364
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,880
How about Korean cuisine
at The Snail Bride?

365
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,779
But I'm sick and
tired of samgyetang.

366
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,009
Can we eat something different?

367
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,319
Samgyetang and ginseng wine...

368
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,620
will rejuvenate us to get
through this hot summer.

369
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,150
Be honest with us, sir.

370
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,860
You just have the
hots for the owner.

371
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,590
What? That's
absolutely ridiculous!

372
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,960
Have you seen the chicken
they serve? Just come along.

373
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,759
Let's go.

374
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,239
Hello?

375
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,469
What is it?

376
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
My mom...

377
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,819
- passed away.
- What?

378
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,779
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

379
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:07,590
I saw a woman in my dream wearing
black mourning garments...

380
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,489
and weeping so eerily.

381
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:11,590
It was you.

382
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:19,900
This is where we part ways.

383
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,440
I hope that we never meet again.

384
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,499
What? You're just leaving me...

385
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,509
with the fact that my
parents are alive somewhere?

386
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,509
A. I'm a busy man.

387
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,749
B. We may currently be
living in the same world,

388
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:34,279
but there's a big difference
between where we come from.

389
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,650
I know that, but...

390
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,249
Those who got a
peek at my world...

391
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,219
ended up going crazy
or dying young.

392
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,460
I don't care and I'll
stay out of your way.

393
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,960
Just don't disappear.

394
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,759
What...

395
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:00,870
Can you get that call first?

396
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,019
Jae Hwan, I can't
talk right now...

397
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,819
Got it.

398
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,890
My coworker's
mother passed away.

399
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,630
She had a dream about
losing a tooth last night.

400
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,329
- A dream?
- She and I both had nightmares.

401
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,110
Contagious nightmares.

402
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,840
Do you really want to see...

403
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,809
the world I live in?

404
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,090
Studio Three, was it?

405
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,090
Yes. I left my equipment
there, but now it's gone.

406
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,900
Director Nam, is this
what you're looking for?

407
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:23,779
What on earth?

408
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:41,535
What on earth?

409
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:13,035
No...

410
00:35:11,796 --> 00:35:14,066
When were you released?

411
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:17,196
I thought you said
you'd stay clean.

412
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,305
- I did nothing wrong.
- Really?

413
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,905
Then am I the jerk here?

414
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,646
Please don't kill me.

415
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,305
Give me one good
reason why I should.

416
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:33,086
- Well...
- There isn't one, right? Then die.

417
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:35,086
Just a second! Hold on.

418
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:41,455
Your brother told me...

419
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,526
that I could feed here.

420
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,166
Rang told you that?

421
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,135
What on earth is that thing?

422
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:51,566
A bulgasari.

423
00:35:52,135 --> 00:35:53,265
A bulgasari?

424
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:55,975
The legendary creature
that feeds on nightmares?

425
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:58,336
Yes, they're especially fond
of broadcasting studios...

426
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,606
which are packed with people.

427
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,276
Eating metal reveals
their true identities.

428
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:10,385
Darn it.

429
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,345
Here's where I ask
you a question.

430
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:42,216
Don't come any closer!

431
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,015
I wasn't talking to you.

432
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:46,756
The hostage will answer.

433
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:51,825
At this very moment,
what can you do for me...

434
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,265
except get in my way?

435
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:57,365
I...

436
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,805
There's nothing you can do.

437
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:17,256
Go back to the
world you belong in.

438
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:20,356
Humans who grow accustomed
to the darkness...

439
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,256
will become beings that are
neither human nor anything else.

440
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:31,495
Hey, you. Get up. I
know you're not dead.

441
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:34,606
<font color="#00ff00">THE YELLOW SEA, JANGSAN POINT</font>

442
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:37,836
- Heave-ho!
- Heave-ho!

443
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,176
- Pull!
- My gosh.

444
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,245
My goodness.

445
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,846
Gosh, I'm hungry.

446
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:46,046
You're not even good
at doing your job.

447
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:48,886
But you never once skip a meal.

448
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:50,716
It's way past lunchtime.

449
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,756
I get seasick on
an empty stomach.

450
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:55,455
When will you ever learn
to do your job properly?

451
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:56,926
He's just like you
when you were young.

452
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,325
- Cut the nonsense!
- My gosh.

453
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:02,566
My goodness!

454
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:05,765
Is... Is that a human skull?

455
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,165
It's a dead body!

456
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:11,205
Watch what you say. Never
say that word on a boat.

457
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,975
Captain, we have
a Yain on board.

458
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,776
- Let's pay our respects.
- Got it.

459
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,785
We're going to
keep this on board?

460
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:20,546
Let's just throw it
back into the water.

461
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:23,455
When you meet a Yain, it's customary
to take him or her back to shore.

462
00:38:23,455 --> 00:38:25,756
If you don't, they
haunt the boat.

463
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,725
That's just a superstition.

464
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:30,325
"Superstition"? The fishing
ground got destroyed...

465
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,325
when people didn't
follow the customs.

466
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,406
I'm sorry you had to
die in the southern sea.

467
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:47,046
This front tooth. The gold
tooth looks exactly like...

468
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:49,276
Is this Mr. Seo?

469
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:55,486
Hey.

470
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:58,725
Whose skull is it?
Do you have a name?

471
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:01,426
Can we eat first?
This is my first meal.

472
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:05,225
You're interested in every case
that occurs in this country.

473
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,566
This time, it's for
something personal.

474
00:39:07,466 --> 00:39:08,495
Don't tell me...

475
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:10,566
you're still trying
to find your parents.

476
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:13,236
You need to get to
your senses, Ji A.

477
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:16,006
Let's stick to the subject.
Save the nagging for later.

478
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:18,006
This time, you'll have to
figure out for yourself.

479
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:21,745
We know who the guy is, but
the coast guard took the case.

480
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:24,716
- Do you know the cause of death?
- No, not yet.

481
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,015
But they identified the victim.

482
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:28,915
Who is it?

483
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:40,866
Let me see my dad.

484
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:43,466
Please let me see my dad!

485
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:46,336
Dad!

486
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,205
Please let me see him!

487
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:25,276
Are you still waiting
for your dead girlfriend?

488
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,475
I heard an interesting rumour.

489
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,285
Should I tell you what it is?

490
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,816
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

491
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,986
this woman will die.

492
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:42,696
Haven't you made
up your mind yet?

493
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:45,355
Please... Please let me live.

494
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:47,895
I'll let you live.

495
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,966
So just tell me where Rang is.

496
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:53,665
I don't know.

497
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,705
You're really inflexible.

498
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:58,205
How are you going to survive
in the 21st century like this?

499
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,745
I'll die even if I
tell you where he is.

500
00:41:05,816 --> 00:41:06,816
Did he say that?

501
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:09,415
I'm way stronger than him.

502
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:13,026
Call him.

503
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:19,625
Let me know if you
change your mind.

504
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:21,265
No, wait.

505
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:26,506
Okay, fine. I'll call him.

506
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:34,575
Hello, it's me.

507
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:37,616
Things didn't exactly
go as planned.

508
00:41:58,836 --> 00:41:59,966
I see you were drinking.

509
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:04,575
- Pour me a glass as well.
- Did you make him call me?

510
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,645
No wonder he sounded nervous.

511
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:11,145
You're all grown up now.
You used to hate raw fish.

512
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:13,086
Stop trying to look relaxed.

513
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,986
You must've been
pretty impatient...

514
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,685
seeing that you showed
up at this hour.

515
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:19,526
I was right, wasn't I?

516
00:42:19,756 --> 00:42:22,086
She was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

517
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:27,526
Do you think she's
dead or alive?

518
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:33,136
She's alive.

519
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:36,435
If you wanted to kill her, you
would've brought her dead body.

520
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,906
And you love making bets,
so you'd never ruin the fun.

521
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:43,676
But what if I leave a dent
on our precious prize?

522
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,645
Don't even think of hurting her.

523
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,256
What will you do to
me if I do hurt her?

524
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:52,116
Tell me. I'm getting
really excited.

525
00:42:54,526 --> 00:42:56,955
You're acting like this
because you lack affection.

526
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:59,096
Don't you get it? You
have a brother complex.

527
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:00,895
Shut it. It's all
because of you.

528
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,995
- Why is that?
- Just because of a woman,

529
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:04,296
you gave up your position
as a mountain spirit,

530
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:05,605
left the mountain,
and you even...

531
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:09,906
Yes, I know. I
even abandoned you.

532
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:22,685
Isn't that what
you wanted to hear?

533
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,785
Get out of my sight right now.

534
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:26,426
Did I upset you?

535
00:43:28,685 --> 00:43:31,596
I'm done playing around.
The girl is in my hands.

536
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:35,495
Mind your manners.

537
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,196
Don't stay outside so late.

538
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,066
And don't drink too much.
It's not good for you.

539
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:44,636
You crazy fool. Do you
even know where she is?

540
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:48,776
Should I tell you or not?

541
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:49,776
I don't need to know.

542
00:43:50,515 --> 00:43:54,245
You're here, and only one accident
occurred in this neighbourhood today.

543
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:06,995
No, I can go alone. I'm just
going to check things out.

544
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,035
Did you pack all the equipment?

545
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:12,196
Yes. Take good care of Ms. Kim.

546
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:14,506
Let me know once she
reserves a funeral hall.

547
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:16,776
Okay, bye.

548
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:26,546
Did you watch the
breaking news? The head.

549
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:29,886
She and I both had nightmares.

550
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,216
This can't be a coincidence.

551
00:44:50,205 --> 00:44:51,605
I didn't notice this earlier.

552
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:54,176
But is that a Kimite patch?

553
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:01,046
Who are you looking
for? A human being?

554
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:02,785
Or a fox?

555
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,855
I'd like to keep it to myself.

556
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:08,225
Tell me. Thanks to my job,

557
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:10,026
I'm pretty good
at finding people.

558
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:11,455
No, thank you.

559
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,296
Why did you want to
come to this island?

560
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:14,566
I thought you wanted
to find your parents.

561
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:17,535
Let me ask you something.

562
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:21,466
Are all the dreams from bulgasaris,
the legendary creatures, true?

563
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:24,805
They cunningly mix
the truth with lies.

564
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:26,975
And they wait for
people to fall for that.

565
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:30,415
So that means part
of it is true.

566
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:35,086
If that's why you're
here, you should go back.

567
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,886
You need to be careful with
what you pay attention to.

568
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:40,455
Too bad. I'm already here.

569
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:48,495
The same boat. The same island.

570
00:45:50,866 --> 00:45:53,066
A woman who looks just like her.

571
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,575
My guts keep telling me...

572
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,205
that this is a very
suspicious combination.

573
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:04,276
What in the world is waiting
for us on that island?

574
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:20,995
My gosh, why did you
only buy streusel bread?

575
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:22,895
I told you to buy
sweet red bean buns.

576
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:24,636
Just eat what I bought for you.

577
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,366
You darn brat.

578
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,435
If you keep acting that way, I
won't buy you anything anymore.

579
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:32,205
No, I take it back. Keep
buying me bread. It's good.

580
00:46:35,846 --> 00:46:37,015
I waited for you.

581
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:39,145
Are you Mr. Seo Ki
Chang's daughter?

582
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:42,586
Excuse me.

583
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,685
I'm Director Nam Ji A,
the person who called.

584
00:46:46,685 --> 00:46:48,026
Is he here with you?

585
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:51,225
- No, he's...
- Yes, I came with her.

586
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,566
- I'm a staff.
- What?

587
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:57,096
- Let's go to my house.
- Sure.

588
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:19,656
Come inside.

589
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,526
Do you want some barley tea?

590
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:25,895
I thought you didn't
want to be involved.

591
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:27,225
I changed my mind.
Don't let it bother you.

592
00:47:27,225 --> 00:47:28,466
What is your problem?

593
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:32,966
What a shabby place. Do I
need to take off my shoes?

594
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:43,446
- I guess your father lived alone.
- Yes.

595
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:46,946
I worked at a semiconductor
factory and lived in Incheon.

596
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:48,716
My dad worked on a boat.

597
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:52,285
Don't be nervous. Make
yourself comfortable.

598
00:47:54,256 --> 00:47:55,926
Did he go missing
because of an accident?

599
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,825
They said the storm
flipped over the boat.

600
00:48:01,026 --> 00:48:02,096
Hey.

601
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:08,236
What did the police say?

602
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,205
They're not sure because of
the severe decomposition.

603
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:12,475
They say if a person...

604
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:15,605
gets caught in the propeller,
their body can get severed.

605
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:31,256
When was the last time you
heard from your father?

606
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:35,026
He called on the
morning of the accident.

607
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:36,966
I missed the call though.

608
00:48:39,506 --> 00:48:41,406
<font color="#00ff00">VOICEMAIL</font>

609
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:42,566
Pyung Hee?

610
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:44,776
Are you eating well?

611
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:48,406
Come by if you aren't too busy.

612
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:52,316
I packed up some
seafood for you.

613
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,756
I keep seeing your late
mom in my dream lately.

614
00:48:58,216 --> 00:49:01,785
She tries to rush off
somewhere, holding your hand.

615
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:04,225
She must miss her daughter.

616
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:06,895
What happened to your mother?

617
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,736
She passed away from cancer.

618
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,305
Why did he have a
dream like that?

619
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:14,605
She came to get you.

620
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:19,605
If someone who died after living
out their allotted time shows up,

621
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:20,875
they're coming for someone.

622
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,816
I'm sure the person who was
supposed to die that day was you.

623
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,486
- Stop it.
- What?

624
00:49:26,886 --> 00:49:28,185
Your father saved your life.

625
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:34,756
Is what some people may
say. That's what I mean.

626
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:37,455
There's no Americano, right?

627
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:39,895
Don't drink too much, and go.

628
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:47,105
Why do you think people from
a Seoul TV station came here?

629
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:49,636
I'm sure that brat Kyung
Hee snitched to them.

630
00:49:49,636 --> 00:49:52,636
We should throw that
brat into the ocean...

631
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:55,446
- and make her fish bait.
- Lower your voice, man.

632
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:07,685
It really gives me a
bad feeling in my mouth.

633
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:11,895
Why did his head have to
get caught in our net?

634
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:15,395
No one has seen Jin Shik...

635
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:18,096
since he found the head, right?

636
00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:31,546
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

637
00:50:32,515 --> 00:50:36,285
I had no choice.

638
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:40,486
Stay here in my house
rather than at a guesthouse.

639
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,156
Thank you.

640
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:45,855
You can use this room.

641
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,696
- I have to step out for a bit.
- Okay.

642
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:51,435
If you insist.

643
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:57,935
It's shabby as expected.

644
00:50:57,935 --> 00:51:00,975
It's fine with me. I'm used to
it from travelling for work.

645
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,446
I'm not fine with it.

646
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:08,446
I'm sorry, but there's one room,
and I have to stick to the subject.

647
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:09,515
What about me?

648
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,455
There's a mountain right there.

649
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:14,026
I saw in a documentary that
burrowing is your specialty.

650
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:16,756
Sorry, but I'm a bit modern.

651
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:18,156
I can't sleep where
there's no boiler.

652
00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:22,765
You can't go.

653
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:23,895
Borrowing is my specialty.

654
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:35,506
Hey.

655
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:38,975
- Who are you?
- I'm a customer.

656
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:40,745
Why don't you have mint
chocolate chip ice cream?

657
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:42,915
Just pick something that I have.

658
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:44,816
You have a terrible
service mentality.

659
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:47,825
Hello. I'm sorry to intrude,

660
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:50,256
but you're the one who found
that head recently, right?

661
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:52,455
Did someone report
it to the TV station?

662
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,696
No. I found out from the news.

663
00:51:55,395 --> 00:51:57,136
May I join you?

664
00:51:57,665 --> 00:51:58,736
Go ahead.

665
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,705
Were you close to
the late Mr. Seo?

666
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:11,676
We lived in the same
town, that's all.

667
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:12,846
We just saw each
other in passing.

668
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:15,716
We were neighbours.
No more, no less.

669
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:20,725
What? From what I hear, you worked
on the same fishing boat for years.

670
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:25,855
We can't talk for free.

671
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:28,696
I'd like to have a drink
poured by a young lady.

672
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,495
I haven't smelled the
scent of makeup in a while.

673
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:43,446
Hey. Why you little...

674
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:46,145
Oh, dear. I was
being too generous.

675
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:48,515
How dare a witch from
outside come here and...

676
00:52:48,515 --> 00:52:51,455
If you're going to hit
me, would you please...

677
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:53,156
turn a little this way?

678
00:52:53,955 --> 00:52:55,125
That angle doesn't
look too great.

679
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:00,765
- Darn it.
- Let's go.

680
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:11,435
Nice. You're tough.

681
00:53:12,506 --> 00:53:14,145
That was nothing.

682
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:21,946
Why are you following me?

683
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:24,256
I'm not following you.

684
00:53:24,716 --> 00:53:26,116
I'm investigating a story.

685
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:29,156
I'm doing something similar.

686
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:32,355
Then go ahead.

687
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:35,665
I plan to piggyback off of
you as much as possible.

688
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:39,096
So you do it.

689
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

690
00:54:01,526 --> 00:54:03,526
Excuse me. May I
ask you something?

691
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:05,955
I just want to
ask you one thing.

692
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:07,196
It won't take long.

693
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:09,796
Excuse me. It won't take...

694
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:11,935
Ma'am.

695
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:16,705
Ma'am. I just need
a few minutes.

696
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:19,075
Why do you make it so hard?

697
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:23,575
It isn't easy to get elderly people
from the countryside to open up.

698
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:25,375
They always sing like
a bird when I ask.

699
00:54:25,546 --> 00:54:26,816
Do you have a special method?

700
00:54:26,816 --> 00:54:29,616
I break their fingers one
by one until they answer.

701
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:32,816
I doubt that will
be very productive.

702
00:54:33,185 --> 00:54:35,055
You don't seem to be very
good at investigating.

703
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:38,055
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

704
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,225
People aren't the only
ones with eyes and mouths.

705
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:52,535
How does he walk so fast?

706
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:07,926
Do you hear something?

707
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:09,526
Hush.

708
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,265
It's a dead forest.

709
00:55:22,205 --> 00:55:23,305
What?

710
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:26,645
All the spirits in
the forest left.

711
00:55:27,676 --> 00:55:28,805
Why is that?

712
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:31,745
Because they were abandoned
and forgotten by people.

713
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,125
Who are you?

714
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,805
I greet the former
master of the forest.

715
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:09,645
- Do you know me?
- I saw you from far away once.

716
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:13,656
You're the spirit of
the guardian tree.

717
00:56:14,926 --> 00:56:17,055
What misfortune happened here?

718
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:19,055
I do not know.

719
00:56:20,026 --> 00:56:22,796
- You don't know?
- This island has changed.

720
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:25,395
The house spirits that
guarded the houses...

721
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,765
and the land spirits all left.

722
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:30,176
So there is nobody to fill me
in on what happens in the town.

723
00:56:31,776 --> 00:56:32,836
Since when?

724
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,846
Since immediately after
the end of the Korean War.

725
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:38,216
Something evil came to the
island riding a typhoon...

726
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,316
But I couldn't see it and
I was too weak to stop it.

727
00:56:42,515 --> 00:56:44,816
It must have been very
lonely being all by yourself.

728
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:45,915
I wanted to leave,

729
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,825
but I couldn't because my
feet are tied to the tree.

730
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,435
Is this why?

731
00:57:00,605 --> 00:57:02,906
Will you cut that for her?

732
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:19,285
You're a soul!

733
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:23,555
You're a spirit.

734
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:26,426
Yes, yes. Dear deceased soul...

735
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,596
who left today.

736
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:32,196
Become a spirit. Become a soul.

737
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:35,566
Thank you.

738
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:38,075
I'm free now.

739
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,946
I don't quite get it,
but I'm glad I helped.

740
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:44,046
By the way, make sure
to wear some shoes.

741
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:46,245
Your pretty feet have
cuts all over them.

742
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:50,515
I see you have a history
with these woods.

743
00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:54,026
But it's my first time here.

744
00:57:54,455 --> 00:57:57,995
Travel north on this island. You'll
find your first answer there.

745
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:05,071
I see you have a history
with these woods.

746
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,040
But it's my first time here.

747
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:09,910
Travel north on this island.

748
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:11,910
You'll find your
first answer there.

749
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,160
She vanished.

750
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:31,001
You did well.

751
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,301
The rope was bound by the
prayers and wishes of humans,

752
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,571
so only a human could untie it.

753
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,151
Mighty King of the Yellow Sea!

754
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,850
Old madam of the
underwater kingdom.

755
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:56,120
- Please return my father's body.
- Old madam!

756
00:58:57,231 --> 00:58:59,131
Please let him have his funeral.

757
00:58:59,131 --> 00:59:02,430
Show mercy for this poor soul...

758
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,001
and return the body...

759
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:07,571
of her father to her.

760
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:09,640
Here I pray.

761
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Here I pray for you.

762
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,910
Here I pray!

763
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,711
- What's wrong?
- He isn't here.

764
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,651
He isn't in the water.

765
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,261
His body returned to
shore before his head did!

766
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:29,790
Your father!

767
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,180
"Jangsansa Cave"?

768
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:50,281
I've never heard of it before.

769
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
<font color="#00ff00">JANGSANSA CAVE ENTRANCE, STAY
CLEAR DURING THE RISING TIDE</font>

770
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,651
I'm going to grab a bite to eat.

771
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:00,890
Stop right there.

772
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:05,191
Don't move for a second.

773
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,560
What is it?

774
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:12,930
I feel like I've seen
this place before.

775
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:31,350
This was the place.

776
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:35,520
This is where this
photo was taken.

777
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:36,961
So you do have
ties to this place.

778
01:00:40,631 --> 01:00:42,761
This was shortly
after I was conceived.

779
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:47,501
I was here too.

780
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:52,171
I came here with my parents
while in my mom's womb.

781
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,490
Why on earth were my parents...

782
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:10,591
on this island?

783
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,901
The duvet stinks. It must
not have been washed.

784
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,941
You're the one who was adamant
about not going to a nicer inn.

785
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:29,841
I have my reasons.

786
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,051
Just so you know,

787
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:42,421
I have a fatty liver.

788
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:50,100
- It's chronic.
- And why must I know this?

789
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,330
You're a nine-tailed fox.

790
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:54,071
Maybe you'll start
craving for liver...

791
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:56,240
We don't eat that crap!

792
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:58,370
- Really?
- Heard of the Chinese liver fluke?

793
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:20,560
Don't laugh especially
with that face you have.

794
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:23,930
What about my face? What?

795
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,200
You're ugly, that's why.

796
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,540
Oh my.

797
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:33,910
He went to the island to
find this reincarnated girl?

798
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:37,450
That's right. He's a romantic
although he seems otherwise.

799
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:40,881
They say that foxes only
mate once in their lives.

800
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:42,481
How romantic.

801
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:45,921
As if that's a good thing.
You know what that cost him.

802
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,490
At least once in our lives,

803
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:50,490
we come across that one person
we want to give our lives to.

804
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,330
I won't ever devote
myself to love.

805
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:54,901
My goal will be to
protect Mr. Lee.

806
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,531
That can also be love.

807
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,511
What was I expecting?

808
01:04:11,111 --> 01:04:13,040
She was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

809
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:15,511
Do you think she's
dead or alive?

810
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:17,850
Is it possible for her to be
reborn with the same face?

811
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,051
Don't look for her.

812
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:21,520
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

813
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,981
this woman will die.

814
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:26,220
It may flip your destiny
upside down again.

815
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,461
What do you say?
I bet you want it.

816
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,330
My goodness. Wild ginseng
isn't easy to find.

817
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,660
How much can this be worth?

818
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:09,901
- Not yet.
- But...

819
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:11,231
Talk to her first.

820
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:14,171
Don't speak informally to her.

821
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,200
But she's only 74 which
is a baby by my standards.

822
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:19,071
What is it that
you want to know?

823
01:05:19,071 --> 01:05:20,111
Go ahead.

824
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,111
Well,

825
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,020
why is everyone keeping
their silence about the head?

826
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,720
Well, that...

827
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,520
- You tell her.
- What?

828
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:37,591
You can't tell anyone...

829
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:40,160
that you heard it from us.

830
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:41,361
I promise.

831
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:45,171
Well, you see,

832
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,640
this isn't the first time.

833
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:48,941
That's right.

834
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,441
The human head...

835
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:59,580
- Jae Hwan, it's me.
- Ms. Nam, you won't believe it.

836
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,421
There really were similar cases?

837
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,720
- And the victims?
- Four Jane Does.

838
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
When?

839
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,961
The first incident
happened in 1954.

840
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:12,330
1954?

841
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,530
What on earth happened
on this island?

842
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:21,171
That man...

843
01:06:22,341 --> 01:06:26,141
Excuse me. Weren't you on the
boat with Pyung Hee's father?

844
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:28,940
Excuse me!

845
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:31,211
Please hear me out!

846
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:33,110
Hold on!

847
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,790
Why are you running away?

848
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,160
Get lost, you ghost!

849
01:06:57,841 --> 01:06:58,971
Don't kill him!

850
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:07,320
Yu Ri, there's something I want.

851
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,150
This place?

852
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,650
We just opened up.

853
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:15,120
The haunted house.

854
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:39,980
It's not that bad.

855
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,561
- What is that?
- It's a folk remedy.

856
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,700
- It's hot.
- Gosh, stop being a crybaby.

857
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,040
Your hand is so hot.

858
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,870
It's burning hot.

859
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,610
What...

860
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:16,620
What's this?

861
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,131
Long time no see, Yeon.

862
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,730
Who are you?

863
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,400
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

864
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:35,700
What?

865
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:39,311
But let me ask you something.

866
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,311
Why...

867
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:45,881
did you kill me?

868
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:28,690
<font color="#00ff00"><b>TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</b></font>

869
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,030
<i>Something's coming.</i>

870
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,860
<i>So this is where it's buried?</i>

871
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,330
<i>A dragon with no feet.
What do you think that is?</i>

872
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:38,001
<i>You've gone head over
heels for a woman.</i>

873
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:40,431
<i>You also ruined your life
because you fell for a woman.</i>

874
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:41,440
<i>What did you say, you punk?</i>

875
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:42,801
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

876
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:45,471
<i>I need to find out why my
parents came to this island.</i>

877
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,410
<i>She'll become a scapegoat.</i>

878
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:51,110
<i>You can't leave this place.</i>

879
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,110
<i>I want you to kill her.</i>

880
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,881
<i>That's how you can
keep your lady alive.</i>
