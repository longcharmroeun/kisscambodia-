<font color="#00ff00"><b>TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</b></font>

7
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,670
I guess you could say that
this was my golden days.

8
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,519
I was the master
of Baekdudaegan,

9
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,459
a mountain spirit who
controlled the wind and rain.

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,389
I was a nine-tailed fox who
was on a different level...

11
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,959
compared to the
lame creatures...

12
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,699
you see on horror shows.

13
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Do you have a death wish?

14
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:49,780
That's odd.

15
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,289
My dog usually likes it
when I pat it this way.

16
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,789
What? How dare you! Do you
have any idea who I am?

17
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,590
You're a fox, aren't
you? Hi, I'm A Eum.

18
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,690
If I was given one
chance to change my past,

19
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,530
I'd choose this moment.

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,399
To make sure that
girl never finds me.

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,470
Lee Yeon!

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,039
How is it that you never
get lost and come every day?

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,950
Here.

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,129
Some call it...

25
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,160
the biggest scandal
of Baekdudaegan.

26
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,830
The story of a mountain
spirit that fell for a human.

27
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,470
In this day and age,
I'd be criticized.

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,539
But I couldn't care less.

29
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,340
I loved how she left
her trace in my woods.

30
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,770
You probably guessed already,

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,199
but this love story
has a tragic ending.

32
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,539
Someone stole her life.

33
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,470
Once she crosses Samdo River,
I'd never get to see her again.

34
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,280
I couldn't make her stay, but
I also couldn't let her go.

35
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,879
It's why I resorted
to abusing my powers.

36
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,210
How dare you!

37
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,349
Please be reincarnated.

38
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,950
I promise...

39
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:50,720
to find you.

40
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,359
Over the years, I came across
a few who did resemble her.

41
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,869
Excuse me.

42
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,340
What is it?

43
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,239
But none of them carried
the fox bead I gave her.

44
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,609
I apologize.

45
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:18,109
Are you A Eum?

46
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,390
You're not A Eum.

47
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,660
Forget everything you saw today.

48
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,970
If you don't,

49
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,039
I'll kill you.

50
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,939
I've been waiting for you.

51
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,049
Maybe I should've just
killed her then and there.

52
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,249
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 2: I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU</font>

53
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,299
Do you have a death wish?

54
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,109
I wouldn't be sipping tea here
if I was worried about that.

55
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:25,340
Would you like some?

56
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,950
Darn it.

57
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,390
After the stunt you pulled,

58
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,530
you're actually offering me tea?

59
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:42,960
Normally after that degree
of physical contact,

60
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,630
two people grab meals
and tea together.

61
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,729
The whole innocent act
doesn't go far these days.

62
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,809
Whether it does or not,

63
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,340
when you want something
from the other person,

64
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,510
it's only polite to
at least put down...

65
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,880
your pride or self-esteem.

66
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,809
Shouldn't you hear
me out first...

67
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,650
to know who's the
more desperate one?

68
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,020
If you don't manage
to change my mind,

69
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,119
you'll get what you
deserve for testing me.

70
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:11,520
It comes with a cost?

71
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,130
I'm going to take your eyes...

72
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,469
for having seen what you
never should've seen.

73
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,839
Deal.

74
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,449
<font color="#00ff00">EUNHA FUNERAL PARLOUR</font>

75
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,219
Do you want everyone to
know that you're a fox?

76
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,289
What?

77
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,459
- Your tail.
- Oh, gosh.

78
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,799
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,270
Are you Director Ki Yu
Ri from Moze Corporation?

80
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,299
Oh, yes.

81
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,110
I'm here to meet the families of
those who died in the bus accident.

82
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,980
I can't believe you
came all the way here.

83
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,049
Come this way.

84
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,520
<font color="#00ff00">EUNHA FUNERAL PARLOUR</font>

85
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,490
Sir, how much should a
conglomerate's daughter give...

86
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,919
to pay her condolences?

87
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,089
Why do you think we're here?

88
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,059
Because you killed them.

89
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,730
We came to enjoy their sadness.

90
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,230
We came to watch something nice,
so you should pay them enough.

91
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,910
Then I'll pay this much and
enjoy watching them all night.

92
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,719
You look exactly how
you looked 21 years ago.

93
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,219
I'm sure you're not going to ask
me how I manage to look so young.

94
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,360
- What are you?
- I'm a nine-tailed fox.

95
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,559
So you're a fox that's
pretending to be human.

96
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,799
What a lame reaction.

97
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:04,370
A normal human being...

98
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,809
- would scream...
- No.

99
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,579
I knew something like
you would exist...

100
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,179
somewhere out in this world.

101
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,980
I started directing a TV
show about urban legends...

102
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,280
so I could catch you myself.

103
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,919
You think you caught me, but it
might be the other way around.

104
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
First, let's hear
what you have to say.

105
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,169
21 years ago, we
met on Yeou Gogae.

106
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,939
What exactly
happened that night?

107
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,679
I followed the smell of blood, and
I ended up saving a little kid.

108
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,650
But I can see that
she's very ungrateful.

109
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,049
You saved me?

110
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:54,250
Why?

111
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,289
You just looked
like someone I knew.

112
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,459
But of course, I was mistaken.

113
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,929
What about my parents?

114
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,459
- They probably died.
- There were no bodies.

115
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,140
You're the only clue I have.

116
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,809
Please help.

117
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,209
I guess you lost your parents.

118
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,309
But I'm sorry to tell you
that I'm not interested...

119
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,949
in your memories of the past.

120
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,120
I'm sorry to say this,

121
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,059
but I'm sure you don't want
the world to know about you.

122
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,400
If things go as planned, the
show will air next Wednesday.

123
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:46,240
Your pretty face
won't get blurred out.

124
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,579
You sure held onto that flash
drive even while you were falling.

125
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,510
What are you trying to do?

126
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,850
You're more powerful than me,

127
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,319
and I obviously can't use the
law to make you cooperate.

128
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,620
But you see, I'm desperate.

129
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,030
I find this boring.

130
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,289
When you want to threaten someone,
you must be in a position of power.

131
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,160
Like this.

132
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,490
You're wrong.

133
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,860
I'm not threatening you.
I'm taking my chances.

134
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,410
When a fox is indebted to someone,
they must return the favour.

135
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,709
I don't care if
you're human or a fox.

136
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,219
I'll erase everything
I saw and heard.

137
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,459
But that is, only after
I find my parents.

138
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,870
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

139
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,799
I'm sorry for your loss.

140
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,309
Come this way.

141
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,780
<font color="#00ff00">REST IN PEACE</font>

142
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,370
What are you doing here?

143
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
- Who are you?
- Moze Department Store.

144
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,510
Don't you remember?

145
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,709
Oh, yes. I remember.

146
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,939
<font color="#00ff00">THE FOUNTAIN OF LUCK, MAKE
A WISH. IT WILL COME TRUE.</font>

147
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,150
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,559
It's okay.

149
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,289
Thank you.

150
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,120
Thank you.

151
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,789
- What did you wish for?
- What about you?

152
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,789
I have an older brother.

153
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,730
I want him to be miserable
for the rest of his life.

154
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,299
He's a real jerk.

155
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,929
I thought I might feel better
if I didn't see him around.

156
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,030
But I was wrong. I can't
seem to sleep at night.

157
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,199
I'm going to keep
bothering him...

158
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,740
until one of us dies.

159
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,410
What did you wish for?

160
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,850
I wished that I'd be able
to marry my girlfriend.

161
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,049
What a humble wish.

162
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,189
My parents won't ever
let me marry her.

163
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,289
Oh, dear. Do you
want me to help?

164
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:27,230
Who are you to help me?

165
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,400
I guess you could
say I'm a miracle.

166
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:43,480
Anyway, congratulations
on your wedding.

167
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,510
Your parents are no longer around
to disapprove of your girlfriend.

168
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,679
Was it you?

169
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,949
- Did you kill my mom and dad?
- Come on.

170
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,020
You have a crazy imagination.

171
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,289
Then what were
those coins about?

172
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,620
I guess you and I...

173
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,360
both got lucky.

174
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,900
She had this.

175
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,669
My goodness, an anesthetic?
She almost killed you!

176
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,209
Will you please sit
down? People are looking.

177
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,209
I'll make sure no one
takes anything again.

178
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,880
By the way, why do you think
her memory didn't get erased?

179
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,719
It's pretty rare, but our powers
don't work that well on some people.

180
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,620
For example, the female
shamans in the past.

181
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,289
But you just let her go?

182
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,589
And you even gave back her eye?

183
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,199
Rules are rules.

184
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:39,360
It's like we exist to repay
people for their kindness.

185
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,000
How long do we need to stick
to that old-fashioned custom?

186
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,469
We give back what we receive.

187
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,140
It's old-fashioned but romantic.

188
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,140
It shows a fox's dignity.

189
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,469
It's also a curse.

190
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,340
The bigger the debt,

191
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,150
the more we lose control
and become puppets.

192
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,919
Does she bother you...

193
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,219
because she looks like A Eum?

194
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,090
I've seen tons of people who looked
like her for hundreds of years.

195
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,429
I watched them
age and pass away.

196
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,729
And none of them were her.

197
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,630
How could the deities
be so indifferent?

198
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,469
Shin Ju, don't put on that face.
It makes you look really ugly.

199
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,009
Give her some.

200
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,150
Here.

201
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,949
Your dad is bored.

202
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:37,989
All done.

203
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,160
58 seconds. That was close.

204
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,060
That's enough. Now,
play with your dad.

205
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,759
I want to beat his record.

206
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,769
Okay, fine. Let's see if
you can beat my record.

207
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Ready, go.

208
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,009
Do you think you can
beat me this time?

209
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,870
Do you think so?

210
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,279
Ta-Da.

211
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,979
Mom, Dad cheated.

212
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:04,050
I'm really sorry.

213
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,679
Here's my apology.

214
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
Will you please accept it?
It's my handmade gimbap.

215
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,860
Please take it

216
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,290
- There you go.
- It's good, right?

217
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:19,300
Let's give your mom one too.
Here's my handmade gimbap.

218
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,529
It's very obvious you're
acting for the camera.

219
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,469
Was it very obvious?
How embarrassing.

220
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,239
Okay, one for me.

221
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,779
It's delicious.

222
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:34,910
I want a gift.

223
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,550
Okay. Look here. Look here.

224
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,189
That's my pretty girl.

225
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,969
Mom?

226
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,820
Okay. All of you died...

227
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,189
in a bus accident on Yeou Gogae.

228
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm sure the grim reapers
briefed you on that already,

229
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,620
so I'll skip that.

230
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,130
Now, you will face the
afterlife judges...

231
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,929
and have the sins you committed
when you were alive judged.

232
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,870
Don't be scared. You have no
need if you were a good person.

233
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,370
You know King Hades, right?

234
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,479
My wife standing there is
King Hades' older sister.

235
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,310
She isn't scary, is she?

236
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,779
I'm terrified.

237
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
- That old fart.
- Have you seen from movies?

238
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:26,019
I should plow his tongue.

239
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,229
- He...
- We need to chat.

240
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,660
set up the five layers of
the Underworld quite well.

241
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,229
The main point is...

242
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,800
- Hello, Director Nam.
- Hello.

243
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,340
I'm on the first floor.
Who wants coffee?

244
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,949
A Eum was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

245
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,090
I'm right.

246
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,290
Why do you want to find her now?

247
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,300
I want revenge.

248
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,800
I was sentenced to 600 years of
obligatory service because of...

249
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,529
Lying will land you
in the Underworld.

250
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,439
Do you want to be barbecued?

251
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:13,570
No. My hair is my life.
My red-brown hair.

252
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,080
You use to be on top of the world
as a mountain spirit. How did you...

253
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:20,310
Let's stop reminiscing
the old days.

254
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,179
- Where is she?
- How should I know?

255
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,820
You're clairvoyant. You see
everything that happens on earth.

256
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:31,919
Is it possible for
her to be reborn...

257
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,959
with the same face?

258
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,989
Hey. Reincarnation is random.

259
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,999
You should pray that
she isn't a boy.

260
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,370
Oh my gosh.

261
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,910
Boy or girl,
beautiful or ugly...

262
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,779
It doesn't matter.

263
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,350
As long as she isn't over 60.

264
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,820
Even if she is over 60, she's
still a baby compared to you.

265
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
No.

266
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,290
I don't want her
to die too soon...

267
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,689
after finally meeting her again.

268
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,269
Why do you look so exhausted?

269
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,709
I saw a dead body in my dream.

270
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,350
- It's an occupational hazard.
- You know,

271
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,249
I saw a woman in my dream...

272
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,019
wearing black mourning
garments and weeping so eerily.

273
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,449
- A virgin ghost?
- No.

274
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,620
It was you.

275
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,259
Hey. Don't jinx her.

276
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,229
- Was it really me?
- Yes.

277
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,469
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

278
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,300
Isn't that a bad dream?

279
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,469
You're so superstitious for someone
who doesn't believe in ghosts.

280
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,779
Don't mind him.

281
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:00,550
Losing a tooth in your dream also
means you may come into wealth.

282
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,449
Thank goodness.

283
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,179
Why you...

284
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,019
Excuse me. Will you
sell me that dream?

285
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,519
What?

286
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,719
I want to play the lottery.

287
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,100
Yeon.

288
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,229
- Don't look for her.
- What?

289
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,070
It may flip your destiny
upside down again.

290
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,310
I don't care.

291
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,749
Stop beating on your husband.

292
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,979
Cut back on delivery foods.
They're not good for your skin.

293
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,679
Here. I found this
on the way here.

294
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,949
I won't be here for a while.

295
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Lipstick?

296
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,090
That's right. Resolve a
civil complaint for me.

297
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,870
Hey.

298
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:01,209
My parents' times
and dates of birth?

299
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,239
Okay. I'll text you.

300
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,120
<font color="#00ff00">DAD: NAM JONG SOO, MAY 3, 1958,
MOM: LEE YOUNG SUN, JUNE 26, 1960</font>

301
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:18,320
It's neither good
news nor bad news.

302
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,290
Let's meet.

303
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:25,529
Meet me at the restaurant
The Snail Bride at 1pm.

304

<font color="#00ff00">THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

306
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,620
Are you here to see Lee Yeon?

307
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,189
Yes.

308
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,390
This way.

309
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,759
Thank you.

310
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,759
You are blessed.

311
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,100
- Pardon?
- It's the first time...

312
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:01,929
he brought a person.

313
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,040
Hey.

314
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,150
About the times and dates of
birth that you asked for...

315
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,290
They're not on the list.

316
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,120
What does that mean?

317
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:23,820
As in, your parents aren't dead.

318
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,620
They're alive?

319
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,830
Where?

320
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,160
I don't know that much.

321
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,300
Why don't you eat?
You're the one paying.

322
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:56,050
It isn't the most
appetizing news, is it?

323
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,259
No, no. I'm very grateful.

324
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,269
Are you sure you're okay?

325
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,669
I'll find them.

326
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,910
I said they may be alive,

327
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,620
but no one believed me.

328
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,050
No one.

329
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:33,830
Sorry about the
anesthetic. I mean it.

330
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,169
You know how to apologize.

331
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,800
I really was despicable.

332
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,300
I won't ask for you
to be understanding.

333
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,040
No. I can understand.

334
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,080
And I do.

335
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:02,489
So?

336
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,019
Why?

337
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,029
Right? She has enteritis, right?

338
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,830
Did you have
tteokbokki yesterday?

339
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,900
What?

340
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,199
- Yes.
- She ate the leftovers.

341
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,199
But that was level-five spicy.

342
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,640
Kong.

343
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:21,070
I'll prescribe a laxative.

344
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,070
Starve her today. Give her
only water and medicine.

345
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:27,279
Don't get sassy with me.

346
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,419
No snacks either, obviously.

347
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,219
Can you tell what she ate
just by looking at her?

348
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:36,719
I speak their language.

349
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,060
- I don't mean to be rude, but...
- No rude questions.

350
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,630
Especially something
that involves my privacy.

351
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,070
Okay. I'll change the question.

352
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,239
There are other foxes in the
world in addition to you, right?

353
00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:04,380
Do they all look like people?

354
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,590
They live in this city...

355
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,790
just like you people.

356
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,360
They worry about real
estate and economic crises.

357
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,429
How do you want to pay?

358
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,800
Here you go.

359
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:25,540
Pay cash and I'll
give you a discount.

360
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,269
Then tell me about Shin Don.

361
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,110
Is it true that the monk of
Goryeo Dynasty was a fox?

362
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,979
My gosh.

363
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,910
- What else?
- Pay up.

364
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,719
Right.

365
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,519
Are there other creatures too?

366
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,959
Of course. And they mostly live
where humans would never guess.

367
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,759
How was today's meal?

368
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:51,959
Not bad.

369
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,340
Let's grab some lunch?

370
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,080
How about Korean cuisine
at The Snail Bride?

371
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,979
But I'm sick and
tired of samgyetang.

372
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,209
Can we eat something different?

373
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:11,519
Samgyetang and ginseng wine...

374
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,820
will rejuvenate us to get
through this hot summer.

375
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,350
Be honest with us, sir.

376
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,060
You just have the
hots for the owner.

377
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,790
What? That's
absolutely ridiculous!

378
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,160
Have you seen the chicken
they serve? Just come along.

379
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,959
Let's go.

380
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,439
Hello?

381
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,669
What is it?

382
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
My mom...

383
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,019
- passed away.
- What?

384
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,979
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

385
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,790
I saw a woman in my dream wearing
black mourning garments...

386
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,689
and weeping so eerily.

387
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:53,790
It was you.

388
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,100
This is where we part ways.

389
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,640
I hope that we never meet again.

390
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,699
What? You're just leaving me...

391
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,709
with the fact that my
parents are alive somewhere?

392
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,709
A. I'm a busy man.

393
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:13,949
B. We may currently be
living in the same world,

394
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,479
but there's a big difference
between where we come from.

395
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,850
I know that, but...

396
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,449
Those who got a
peek at my world...

397
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,419
ended up going crazy
or dying young.

398
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,660
I don't care and I'll
stay out of your way.

399
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,160
Just don't disappear.

400
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,959
What...

401
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,070
Can you get that call first?

402
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,219
Jae Hwan, I can't
talk right now...

403
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,019
Got it.

404
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,090
My coworker's
mother passed away.

405
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,830
She had a dream about
losing a tooth last night.

406
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,529
- A dream?
- She and I both had nightmares.

407
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,310
Contagious nightmares.

408
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,040
Do you really want to see...

409
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,009
the world I live in?

410
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,290
Studio Three, was it?

411
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,290
Yes. I left my equipment
there, but now it's gone.

412
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,100
Director Nam, is this
what you're looking for?

413
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:05,979
What on earth?

414
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:23,735
What on earth?

415
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,235
No...

416
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:56,266
When were you released?

417
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:59,396
I thought you said
you'd stay clean.

418
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:02,505
- I did nothing wrong.
- Really?

419
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:04,105
Then am I the jerk here?

420
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:07,846
Please don't kill me.

421
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,505
Give me one good
reason why I should.

422
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:15,286
- Well...
- There isn't one, right? Then die.

423
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:17,286
Just a second! Hold on.

424
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,655
Your brother told me...

425
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:25,726
that I could feed here.

426
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,366
Rang told you that?

427
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:31,335
What on earth is that thing?

428
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:33,766
A bulgasari.

429
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:35,465
A bulgasari?

430
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:38,175
The legendary creature
that feeds on nightmares?

431
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,536
Yes, they're especially fond
of broadcasting studios...

432
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:41,806
which are packed with people.

433
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,476
Eating metal reveals
their true identities.

434
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,585
Darn it.

435
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:22,545
Here's where I ask
you a question.

436
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:24,416
Don't come any closer!

437
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:26,215
I wasn't talking to you.

438
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:28,956
The hostage will answer.

439
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:34,025
At this very moment,
what can you do for me...

440
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:35,465
except get in my way?

441
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:39,565
I...

442
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,005
There's nothing you can do.

443
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,456
Go back to the
world you belong in.

444
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:02,556
Humans who grow accustomed
to the darkness...

445
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:05,456
will become beings that are
neither human nor anything else.

446
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:13,695
Hey, you. Get up. I
know you're not dead.

447
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:16,806
<font color="#00ff00">THE YELLOW SEA, JANGSAN POINT</font>

448
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:20,036
- Heave-ho!
- Heave-ho!

449
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:21,376
- Pull!
- My gosh.

450
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:24,445
My goodness.

451
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:26,046
Gosh, I'm hungry.

452
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,246
You're not even good
at doing your job.

453
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:31,086
But you never once skip a meal.

454
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:32,916
It's way past lunchtime.

455
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:34,956
I get seasick on
an empty stomach.

456
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:37,655
When will you ever learn
to do your job properly?

457
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,126
He's just like you
when you were young.

458
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:41,525
- Cut the nonsense!
- My gosh.

459
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:44,766
My goodness!

460
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,965
Is... Is that a human skull?

461
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:50,365
It's a dead body!

462
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:53,405
Watch what you say. Never
say that word on a boat.

463
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:57,175
Captain, we have
a Yain on board.

464
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:58,976
- Let's pay our respects.
- Got it.

465
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:00,985
We're going to
keep this on board?

466
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,746
Let's just throw it
back into the water.

467
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:05,655
When you meet a Yain, it's customary
to take him or her back to shore.

468
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,956
If you don't, they
haunt the boat.

469
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:09,925
That's just a superstition.

470
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:12,525
"Superstition"? The fishing
ground got destroyed...

471
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:14,525
when people didn't
follow the customs.

472
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:21,606
I'm sorry you had to
die in the southern sea.

473
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:29,246
This front tooth. The gold
tooth looks exactly like...

474
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,476
Is this Mr. Seo?

475
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:37,686
Hey.

476
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:40,925
Whose skull is it?
Do you have a name?

477
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,626
Can we eat first?
This is my first meal.

478
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:47,425
You're interested in every case
that occurs in this country.

479
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:48,766
This time, it's for
something personal.

480
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,695
Don't tell me...

481
00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:52,766
you're still trying
to find your parents.

482
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,436
You need to get to
your senses, Ji A.

483
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:58,206
Let's stick to the subject.
Save the nagging for later.

484
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:00,206
This time, you'll have to
figure out for yourself.

485
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:03,945
We know who the guy is, but
the coast guard took the case.

486
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:06,916
- Do you know the cause of death?
- No, not yet.

487
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,215
But they identified the victim.

488
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,115
Who is it?

489
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:23,066
Let me see my dad.

490
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,666
Please let me see my dad!

491
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:28,536
Dad!

492
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:37,405
Please let me see him!

493
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:07,476
Are you still waiting
for your dead girlfriend?

494
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,675
I heard an interesting rumour.

495
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,485
Should I tell you what it is?

496
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:17,016
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

497
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,186
this woman will die.

498
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:24,896
Haven't you made
up your mind yet?

499
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,555
Please... Please let me live.

500
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:30,095
I'll let you live.

501
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,166
So just tell me where Rang is.

502
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:35,865
I don't know.

503
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:37,905
You're really inflexible.

504
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,405
How are you going to survive
in the 21st century like this?

505
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:44,945
I'll die even if I
tell you where he is.

506
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,016
Did he say that?

507
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,615
I'm way stronger than him.

508
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:55,226
Call him.

509
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,825
Let me know if you
change your mind.

510
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:03,465
No, wait.

511
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,706
Okay, fine. I'll call him.

512
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:16,775
Hello, it's me.

513
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:19,816
Things didn't exactly
go as planned.

514
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,166
I see you were drinking.

515
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,775
- Pour me a glass as well.
- Did you make him call me?

516
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:49,845
No wonder he sounded nervous.

517
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:53,345
You're all grown up now.
You used to hate raw fish.

518
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:55,286
Stop trying to look relaxed.

519
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:58,186
You must've been
pretty impatient...

520
00:42:58,186 --> 00:42:59,885
seeing that you showed
up at this hour.

521
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:01,726
I was right, wasn't I?

522
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,286
She was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

523
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:09,726
Do you think she's
dead or alive?

524
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:15,336
She's alive.

525
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,635
If you wanted to kill her, you
would've brought her dead body.

526
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:23,106
And you love making bets,
so you'd never ruin the fun.

527
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,876
But what if I leave a dent
on our precious prize?

528
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:30,845
Don't even think of hurting her.

529
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:32,456
What will you do to
me if I do hurt her?

530
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:34,316
Tell me. I'm getting
really excited.

531
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:39,155
You're acting like this
because you lack affection.

532
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:41,296
Don't you get it? You
have a brother complex.

533
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,095
Shut it. It's all
because of you.

534
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:45,195
- Why is that?
- Just because of a woman,

535
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:46,496
you gave up your position
as a mountain spirit,

536
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:47,805
left the mountain,
and you even...

537
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:52,106
Yes, I know. I
even abandoned you.

538
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:04,885
Isn't that what
you wanted to hear?

539
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:06,985
Get out of my sight right now.

540
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:08,626
Did I upset you?

541
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:13,796
I'm done playing around.
The girl is in my hands.

542
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:17,695
Mind your manners.

543
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,396
Don't stay outside so late.

544
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:23,266
And don't drink too much.
It's not good for you.

545
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:26,836
You crazy fool. Do you
even know where she is?

546
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:30,976
Should I tell you or not?

547
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:31,976
I don't need to know.

548
00:44:32,715 --> 00:44:36,445
You're here, and only one accident
occurred in this neighbourhood today.

549
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:49,195
No, I can go alone. I'm just
going to check things out.

550
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:51,235
Did you pack all the equipment?

551
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:54,396
Yes. Take good care of Ms. Kim.

552
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:56,706
Let me know once she
reserves a funeral hall.

553
00:44:57,905 --> 00:44:58,976
Okay, bye.

554
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:08,746
Did you watch the
breaking news? The head.

555
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:12,086
She and I both had nightmares.

556
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:14,416
This can't be a coincidence.

557
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:33,805
I didn't notice this earlier.

558
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:36,376
But is that a Kimite patch?

559
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:43,246
Who are you looking
for? A human being?

560
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:44,985
Or a fox?

561
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:47,055
I'd like to keep it to myself.

562
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:50,425
Tell me. Thanks to my job,

563
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:52,226
I'm pretty good
at finding people.

564
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:53,655
No, thank you.

565
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:55,496
Why did you want to
come to this island?

566
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:56,766
I thought you wanted
to find your parents.

567
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:59,735
Let me ask you something.

568
00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:03,666
Are all the dreams from bulgasaris,
the legendary creatures, true?

569
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:07,005
They cunningly mix
the truth with lies.

570
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:09,175
And they wait for
people to fall for that.

571
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,615
So that means part
of it is true.

572
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:17,286
If that's why you're
here, you should go back.

573
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,086
You need to be careful with
what you pay attention to.

574
00:46:20,316 --> 00:46:22,655
Too bad. I'm already here.

575
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:30,695
The same boat. The same island.

576
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:35,266
A woman who looks just like her.

577
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:38,775
My guts keep telling me...

578
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:42,405
that this is a very
suspicious combination.

579
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:46,476
What in the world is waiting
for us on that island?

580
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:03,195
My gosh, why did you
only buy streusel bread?

581
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,095
I told you to buy
sweet red bean buns.

582
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:06,836
Just eat what I bought for you.

583
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:08,566
You darn brat.

584
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:11,635
If you keep acting that way, I
won't buy you anything anymore.

585
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:14,405
No, I take it back. Keep
buying me bread. It's good.

586
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,215
I waited for you.

587
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,345
Are you Mr. Seo Ki
Chang's daughter?

588
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:24,786
Excuse me.

589
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:26,885
I'm Director Nam Ji A,
the person who called.

590
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,226
Is he here with you?

591
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:33,425
- No, he's...
- Yes, I came with her.

592
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:36,766
- I'm a staff.
- What?

593
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:39,296
- Let's go to my house.
- Sure.

594
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:01,956
Come inside.

595
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:03,826
Do you want some barley tea?

596
00:48:06,755 --> 00:48:08,195
I thought you didn't
want to be involved.

597
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:09,525
I changed my mind.
Don't let it bother you.

598
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:10,766
What is your problem?

599
00:48:11,996 --> 00:48:15,266
What a shabby place. Do I
need to take off my shoes?

600
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:25,746
- I guess your father lived alone.
- Yes.

601
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:29,246
I worked at a semiconductor
factory and lived in Incheon.

602
00:48:29,585 --> 00:48:31,016
My dad worked on a boat.

603
00:48:32,616 --> 00:48:34,585
Don't be nervous. Make
yourself comfortable.

604
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:38,226
Did he go missing
because of an accident?

605
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:41,125
They said the storm
flipped over the boat.

606
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:44,396
Hey.

607
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,536
What did the police say?

608
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:52,505
They're not sure because of
the severe decomposition.

609
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:54,775
They say if a person...

610
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:57,905
gets caught in the propeller,
their body can get severed.

611
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:13,556
When was the last time you
heard from your father?

612
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:17,326
He called on the
morning of the accident.

613
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:19,266
I missed the call though.

614
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:23,706
<font color="#00ff00">VOICEMAIL</font>

615
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:24,866
Pyung Hee?

616
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:27,076
Are you eating well?

617
00:49:28,206 --> 00:49:30,706
Come by if you aren't too busy.

618
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,616
I packed up some
seafood for you.

619
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:40,056
I keep seeing your late
mom in my dream lately.

620
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:44,085
She tries to rush off
somewhere, holding your hand.

621
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:46,525
She must miss her daughter.

622
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,195
What happened to your mother?

623
00:49:50,496 --> 00:49:52,036
She passed away from cancer.

624
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:55,605
Why did he have a
dream like that?

625
00:49:55,605 --> 00:49:56,905
She came to get you.

626
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:01,905
If someone who died after living
out their allotted time shows up,

627
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:03,175
they're coming for someone.

628
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:07,116
I'm sure the person who was
supposed to die that day was you.

629
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:08,786
- Stop it.
- What?

630
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,485
Your father saved your life.

631
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:17,056
Is what some people may
say. That's what I mean.

632
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:19,755
There's no Americano, right?

633
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:22,195
Don't drink too much, and go.

634
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:29,405
Why do you think people from
a Seoul TV station came here?

635
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,936
I'm sure that brat Kyung
Hee snitched to them.

636
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:34,936
We should throw that
brat into the ocean...

637
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:37,746
- and make her fish bait.
- Lower your voice, man.

638
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,985
It really gives me a
bad feeling in my mouth.

639
00:50:50,355 --> 00:50:54,195
Why did his head have to
get caught in our net?

640
00:50:55,695 --> 00:50:57,695
No one has seen Jin Shik...

641
00:50:58,065 --> 00:51:00,396
since he found the head, right?

642
00:51:10,846 --> 00:51:13,846
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

643
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:18,585
I had no choice.

644
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,786
Stay here in my house
rather than at a guesthouse.

645
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:24,456
Thank you.

646
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:28,155
You can use this room.

647
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:30,996
- I have to step out for a bit.
- Okay.

648
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,735
If you insist.

649
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:40,235
It's shabby as expected.

650
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:43,275
It's fine with me. I'm used to
it from travelling for work.

651
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:45,746
I'm not fine with it.

652
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:50,746
I'm sorry, but there's one room,
and I have to stick to the subject.

653
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:51,815
What about me?

654
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,755
There's a mountain right there.

655
00:51:54,085 --> 00:51:56,326
I saw in a documentary that
burrowing is your specialty.

656
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,056
Sorry, but I'm a bit modern.

657
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:00,456
I can't sleep where
there's no boiler.

658
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,065
You can't go.

659
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,195
Borrowing is my specialty.

660
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:17,806
Hey.

661
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:21,275
- Who are you?
- I'm a customer.

662
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:23,045
Why don't you have mint
chocolate chip ice cream?

663
00:52:23,045 --> 00:52:25,215
Just pick something that I have.

664
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,116
You have a terrible
service mentality.

665
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,125
Hello. I'm sorry to intrude,

666
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,556
but you're the one who found
that head recently, right?

667
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:34,755
Did someone report
it to the TV station?

668
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:36,996
No. I found out from the news.

669
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:39,436
May I join you?

670
00:52:39,965 --> 00:52:41,036
Go ahead.

671
00:52:46,735 --> 00:52:50,005
Were you close to
the late Mr. Seo?

672
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:53,976
We lived in the same
town, that's all.

673
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:55,146
We just saw each
other in passing.

674
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:58,016
We were neighbours.
No more, no less.

675
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:03,025
What? From what I hear, you worked
on the same fishing boat for years.

676
00:53:06,326 --> 00:53:08,155
We can't talk for free.

677
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:10,996
I'd like to have a drink
poured by a young lady.

678
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:13,795
I haven't smelled the
scent of makeup in a while.

679
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:25,746
Hey. Why you little...

680
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:28,445
Oh, dear. I was
being too generous.

681
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:30,815
How dare a witch from
outside come here and...

682
00:53:30,815 --> 00:53:33,755
If you're going to hit
me, would you please...

683
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,456
turn a little this way?

684
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,425
That angle doesn't
look too great.

685
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:43,065
- Darn it.
- Let's go.

686
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:53,735
Nice. You're tough.

687
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:56,445
That was nothing.

688
00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:04,246
Why are you following me?

689
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:06,556
I'm not following you.

690
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:08,416
I'm investigating a story.

691
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:11,456
I'm doing something similar.

692
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,655
Then go ahead.

693
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:17,965
I plan to piggyback off of
you as much as possible.

694
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:21,396
So you do it.

695
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:28,175
Excuse me, ma'am.

696
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:45,826
Excuse me. May I
ask you something?

697
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:48,255
I just want to
ask you one thing.

698
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,496
It won't take long.

699
00:54:49,695 --> 00:54:52,096
Excuse me. It won't take...

700
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:54,235
Ma'am.

701
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:59,005
Ma'am. I just need
a few minutes.

702
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,375
Why do you make it so hard?

703
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:05,875
It isn't easy to get elderly people
from the countryside to open up.

704
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,675
They always sing like
a bird when I ask.

705
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,116
Do you have a special method?

706
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:11,916
I break their fingers one
by one until they answer.

707
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:15,116
I doubt that will
be very productive.

708
00:55:15,485 --> 00:55:17,355
You don't seem to be very
good at investigating.

709
00:55:17,956 --> 00:55:20,355
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

710
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:23,525
People aren't the only
ones with eyes and mouths.

711
00:55:33,136 --> 00:55:34,835
How does he walk so fast?

712
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:50,226
Do you hear something?

713
00:55:50,686 --> 00:55:51,826
Hush.

714
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:03,565
It's a dead forest.

715
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:05,605
What?

716
00:56:06,536 --> 00:56:08,945
All the spirits in
the forest left.

717
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,105
Why is that?

718
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:14,045
Because they were abandoned
and forgotten by people.

719
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:23,425
Who are you?

720
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:41,105
I greet the former
master of the forest.

721
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:51,945
- Do you know me?
- I saw you from far away once.

722
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:55,956
You're the spirit of
the guardian tree.

723
00:56:57,226 --> 00:56:59,355
What misfortune happened here?

724
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,355
I do not know.

725
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:05,096
- You don't know?
- This island has changed.

726
00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:07,695
The house spirits that
guarded the houses...

727
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:10,065
and the land spirits all left.

728
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:12,476
So there is nobody to fill me
in on what happens in the town.

729
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,136
Since when?

730
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:17,146
Since immediately after
the end of the Korean War.

731
00:57:17,445 --> 00:57:20,516
Something evil came to the
island riding a typhoon...

732
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:24,616
But I couldn't see it and
I was too weak to stop it.

733
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,116
It must have been very
lonely being all by yourself.

734
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:28,215
I wanted to leave,

735
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:32,125
but I couldn't because my
feet are tied to the tree.

736
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:42,735
Is this why?

737
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:45,206
Will you cut that for her?

738
00:57:57,315 --> 00:58:01,585
You're a soul!

739
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:05,855
You're a spirit.

740
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:08,726
Yes, yes. Dear deceased soul...

741
00:58:08,795 --> 00:58:10,896
who left today.

742
00:58:11,065 --> 00:58:14,496
Become a spirit. Become a soul.

743
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:17,866
Thank you.

744
00:58:18,735 --> 00:58:20,375
I'm free now.

745
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,246
I don't quite get it,
but I'm glad I helped.

746
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:26,346
By the way, make sure
to wear some shoes.

747
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:28,545
Your pretty feet have
cuts all over them.

748
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:32,815
I see you have a history
with these woods.

749
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:36,326
But it's my first time here.

750
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:40,295
Travel north on this island. You'll
find your first answer there.

751
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,371
I see you have a history
with these woods.

752
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,340
But it's my first time here.

753
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:52,210
Travel north on this island.

754
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,210
You'll find your
first answer there.

755
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,460
She vanished.

756
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:13,301
You did well.

757
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,601
The rope was bound by the
prayers and wishes of humans,

758
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,871
so only a human could untie it.

759
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,451
Mighty King of the Yellow Sea!

760
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,150
Old madam of the
underwater kingdom.

761
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,420
- Please return my father's body.
- Old madam!

762
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:41,431
Please let him have his funeral.

763
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:44,730
Show mercy for this poor soul...

764
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,301
and return the body...

765
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:49,871
of her father to her.

766
00:59:50,141 --> 00:59:51,940
Here I pray.

767
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,940
Here I pray for you.

768
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,210
Here I pray!

769
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,011
- What's wrong?
- He isn't here.

770
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,951
He isn't in the water.

771
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,561
His body returned to
shore before his head did!

772
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:12,090
Your father!

773
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,480
"Jangsansa Cave"?

774
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:32,581
I've never heard of it before.

775
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
<font color="#00ff00">JANGSANSA CAVE ENTRANCE, STAY
CLEAR DURING THE RISING TIDE</font>

776
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,951
I'm going to grab a bite to eat.

777
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,190
Stop right there.

778
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,491
Don't move for a second.

779
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,860
What is it?

780
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:55,230
I feel like I've seen
this place before.

781
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:13,650
This was the place.

782
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:17,820
This is where this
photo was taken.

783
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:19,261
So you do have
ties to this place.

784
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:25,061
This was shortly
after I was conceived.

785
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,801
I was here too.

786
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:34,471
I came here with my parents
while in my mom's womb.

787
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,790
Why on earth were my parents...

788
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:52,891
on this island?

789
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,201
The duvet stinks. It must
not have been washed.

790
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:08,241
You're the one who was adamant
about not going to a nicer inn.

791
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:12,141
I have my reasons.

792
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,351
Just so you know,

793
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:24,721
I have a fatty liver.

794
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:32,400
- It's chronic.
- And why must I know this?

795
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,630
You're a nine-tailed fox.

796
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:36,371
Maybe you'll start
craving for liver...

797
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:38,540
We don't eat that crap!

798
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:40,670
- Really?
- Heard of the Chinese liver fluke?

799
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:02,860
Don't laugh especially
with that face you have.

800
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:06,230
What about my face? What?

801
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,500
You're ugly, that's why.

802
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,840
Oh my.

803
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:16,210
He went to the island to
find this reincarnated girl?

804
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:19,750
That's right. He's a romantic
although he seems otherwise.

805
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:23,181
They say that foxes only
mate once in their lives.

806
01:03:23,681 --> 01:03:24,781
How romantic.

807
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:28,221
As if that's a good thing.
You know what that cost him.

808
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,790
At least once in our lives,

809
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:32,790
we come across that one person
we want to give our lives to.

810
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,630
I won't ever devote
myself to love.

811
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:37,201
My goal will be to
protect Mr. Lee.

812
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,831
That can also be love.

813
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,811
What was I expecting?

814
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,340
She was reincarnated,
wasn't she?

815
01:04:56,511 --> 01:04:57,811
Do you think she's
dead or alive?

816
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,150
Is it possible for her to be
reborn with the same face?

817
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,351
Don't look for her.

818
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:03,820
If you don't find it until
the end of the next month,

819
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,281
this woman will die.

820
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,520
It may flip your destiny
upside down again.

821
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,761
What do you say?
I bet you want it.

822
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,630
My goodness. Wild ginseng
isn't easy to find.

823
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,960
How much can this be worth?

824
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,201
- Not yet.
- But...

825
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:53,531
Talk to her first.

826
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:56,471
Don't speak informally to her.

827
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,500
But she's only 74 which
is a baby by my standards.

828
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,371
What is it that
you want to know?

829
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:02,411
Go ahead.

830
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,411
Well,

831
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,320
why is everyone keeping
their silence about the head?

832
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,020
Well, that...

833
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,820
- You tell her.
- What?

834
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:19,891
You can't tell anyone...

835
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:22,460
that you heard it from us.

836
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,661
I promise.

837
01:06:24,931 --> 01:06:27,471
Well, you see,

838
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,940
this isn't the first time.

839
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:31,241
That's right.

840
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,741
The human head...

841
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:41,880
- Jae Hwan, it's me.
- Ms. Nam, you won't believe it.

842
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,721
There really were similar cases?

843
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,020
- And the victims?
- Four Jane Does.

844
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,020
When?

845
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,261
The first incident
happened in 1954.

846
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:54,630
1954?

847
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,830
What on earth happened
on this island?

848
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:03,471
That man...

849
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:08,441
Excuse me. Weren't you on the
boat with Pyung Hee's father?

850
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,240
Excuse me!

851
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:13,511
Please hear me out!

852
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:15,410
Hold on!

853
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:21,090
Why are you running away?

854
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:25,460
Get lost, you ghost!

855
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:41,271
Don't kill him!

856
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,620
Yu Ri, there's something I want.

857
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,450
This place?

858
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:54,950
We just opened up.

859
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:57,420
The haunted house.

860
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,280
It's not that bad.

861
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,861
- What is that?
- It's a folk remedy.

862
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,000
- It's hot.
- Gosh, stop being a crybaby.

863
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,340
Your hand is so hot.

864
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,170
It's burning hot.

865
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,910
What...

866
01:08:57,851 --> 01:08:58,920
What's this?

867
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:10,431
Long time no see, Yeon.

868
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,030
Who are you?

869
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,700
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

870
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:18,000
What?

871
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:21,611
But let me ask you something.

872
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,611
Why...

873
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:28,181
did you kill me?

874
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:10,990
<font color="#00ff00"><b>TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</b></font>

875
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,330
<i>Something's coming.</i>

876
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,160
<i>So this is where it's buried?</i>

877
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:18,630
<i>A dragon with no feet.
What do you think that is?</i>

878
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,301
<i>You've gone head over
heels for a woman.</i>

879
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,731
<i>You also ruined your life
because you fell for a woman.</i>

880
01:10:22,731 --> 01:10:23,740
<i>What did you say, you punk?</i>

881
01:10:23,941 --> 01:10:25,101
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

882
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:27,771
<i>I need to find out why my
parents came to this island.</i>

883
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,710
<i>She'll become a scapegoat.</i>

884
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:33,410
<i>You can't leave this place.</i>

885
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,410
<i>I want you to kill her.</i>

886
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,181
<i>That's how you can
keep your lady alive.</i>
