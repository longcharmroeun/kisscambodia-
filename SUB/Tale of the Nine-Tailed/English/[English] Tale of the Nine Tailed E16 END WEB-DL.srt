Once you fall into
the Samdo River,

8
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,237
you'll never be
able to come back.

9
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:06,877
No.

10
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,246
I love you.

11
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,647
No!

12
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:17,816
No!

13
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:57,027
Yeon!

14
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:54,247
Don't leave me.

15
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:58,187
Yeon!

16
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,527
I can hear her crying.

17
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:03,997
Yeon!

18
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,397
I must tell her...

19
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,096
that she shouldn't be so sad...

20
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:15,066
and that the love story
of a human and fox...

21
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,606
always ends this way.

22
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,076
From the beginning,

23
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,087
we belonged in two
different worlds.

24
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,527
Using our love as a bridge,

25
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,897
I wished to cross
over to her world.

26
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:42,126
I wished to be with her longer.

27
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:51,737
I wished to be a mortal.

28
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:55,506
My dreams...

29
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:58,816
never came true,

30
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,346
but my death...

31
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,517
is the most...

32
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,057
passionate love letter...

33
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:13,467
sent to my first and last love.

34
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,997
I hope...

35
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,467
that she doesn't wait for me.

36
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:25,376
I hope she doesn't cry too much.

37
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:30,416
And I'd give anything to
see her one last time.

38
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:17,696
I...

39
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:21,297
no longer can see her face.

Jae Hwan.

42
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:16,857
Ms. Kim?

43
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,386
Ms. Kim!

44
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,487
- Hold on.
- Are you all right?

45
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:22,787
Well...

46
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:27,797
Could a miracle actually
exist in this world?

47
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:32,997
The unknown contagious disease
that drove people to fear...

48
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:34,636
vanished as of last night.

49
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,776
Patients of this puzzling disease
and their family members...

50
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:41,946
who had no choice but
to succumb to it...

51
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,816
embraced with each
other with tears of joy.

52
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:20,687
Finally, everything has
come back to normal.

53
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,016
I couldn't...

54
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,716
save Yeon.

55
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:31,157
Once again, I lost a
young man I adored.

56
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,997
That's not true. You did
everything you could...

57
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,537
to help Yeon.

58
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:42,206
That's why I came back to you.

59
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,216
I hope Yeon didn't suffer.

60
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:54,987
He probably didn't.

61
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:59,516
He saved the girl which
is all that he wished.

62
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,836
Mr. Hyeonuiong.

63
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:19,407
Mr. Hyeonuiong!

64
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:24,646
It's Ji A, please open the door.

65
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,086
What do I do?

66
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,287
Don't open the door for her.

67
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,687
But...

68
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:31,357
She should forget about Yeon...

69
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,287
and live an ordinary
life among others.

70
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,797
Please tell me...

71
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,227
what I need to do to save Yeon.

72
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:45,066
Tell me what I can do.

73
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,566
Can you please...

74
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,907
just tell me what I should do?

75
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,756
Mr. Hyeonuiong.

76
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,586
Please open the door.

77
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:10,187
Please.

78
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,126
Why can't we just open the door?

79
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,027
Rang!

80
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,687
Mr. Lee, should I
buy you naengmyeon?

81
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:43,216
Get out.

82
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:46,157
You haven't eaten anything
but alcohol for three days.

83
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:47,726
I said get out.

84
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,057
It wasn't your fault.

85
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:52,996
You just did what
Yeon asked you to do.

86
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:57,196
Say one more word
and I'll kill you.

87
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,537
Do you want stickers?

88
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,076
I have a really cool car too.

89
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:09,507
Will both of you just get
lost? Get out of my house!

90
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:48,846
Thank you for letting me in.

91
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,086
I have no time to console
your broken heart,

92
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,287
so I'll just get to the point.

93
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:53,757
Yeon is dead.

94
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,287
You can't do anything
to bring him back.

95
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,927
I may not be able to do
anything, but you can.

96
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,627
You have control over life and
death so there must be something...

97
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,667
We also have rules
in this world.

98
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,566
There are things that
just can't be done.

99
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,336
Then at least let
him get reincarnated.

100
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,576
I don't care if he
doesn't recognize me.

101
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,807
I'm fine even if he forgets
everything about me, so please...

102
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:16,177
Yeon willingly chose to
jump into the Samdo River.

103
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,517
He knew he wouldn't be
able to be reincarnated,

104
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,216
but he still chose to do so.

105
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,716
So stop protesting in
front of my office.

106
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:26,287
You can't undo what's been
done by throwing a tantrum.

107
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,326
No, I'm sure there's a way.

108
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,557
There must be a way
to bring Yeon back.

109
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:32,657
That will...

110
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,226
never happen.

111
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,566
I let you in to tell you that.

112
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:42,606
Ma'am.

113
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,137
Ma'am, wait. Ma'am.

114
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,446
It's so dark.

115
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,387
The street lamps are out.

116
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:58,316
It would be so cool if you
could use your powers...

117
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,856
to fix them.

118
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:02,127
Submit a request to
the local authority.

119
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:41,667
Are you okay?

120
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,236
The street lamps are on again.

121
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:48,236
I called the local authority.

122
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,037
You didn't have to do that.

123
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:55,807
If you get hurt, I'll get
an earful from Mr. Lee.

124
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:59,017
Dr. Koo.

125
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:01,216
Are you okay?

126
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,157
I need to be okay
even if I'm not.

127
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:07,986
I have a lot to do.

128
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,326
I just met the gatekeeper
of the Samdo River.

129
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:16,397
She told me there's no
way to save Mr. Lee.

130
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,297
Yeon knew this would
happen from the very start.

131
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:24,037
But he still chose to sacrifice
himself for the woman he loved.

132
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,907
What am I supposed to do?

133
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,946
Just live your life like
nothing ever happened.

134
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,057
Forget having met Mr. Lee...

135
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,387
and everything you saw
regarding our world,

136
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:41,486
and live a normal life.

137
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:46,927
That's what he wants for you.

138
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,476
Shin Ju.

139
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:04,476
- Is he still inside?
- He won't even budge.

140
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,846
I'm worried he might collapse.

141
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:09,547
Let me talk to him.

142
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,736
- Why are you being like this?
- Isn't it obvious?

143
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,236
This won't bring Mr. Lee back.

144
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:33,236
I can't believe
you just said that.

145
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:37,576
But you look completely fine.

146
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,647
You always acted like you could
sacrifice your life for him.

147
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,586
You're an ungrateful
piece of trash.

148
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:45,157
You can call me
whatever you want.

149
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,657
But I need to say this to you.

150
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,586
Save the darn lecture and
give me back my alcohol.

151
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,927
Get it together.

152
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:52,157
You crazy punk.

153
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,927
Stop acting like a baby
and start living your life.

154
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,466
- Do you have a death wish?
- Mr. Lee told me to tell you that.

155
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:12,346
You can go ahead and
listen to the rest.

156
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,007
Is this working?
Okay, there we go.

157
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,177
Hey, it's me.

158
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:43,076
We just had naengmyeon together.

159
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:47,216
And you ate my egg.

160
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,257
If you're watching this,

161
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,627
I'm probably no longer alive.

162
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,226
My gosh.

163
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:00,726
This is so corny.

164
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,596
This kind of stuff
looked cool in movies.

165
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,236
I'm sure it'll be neat
enough to keep as a keepsake.

166
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,576
Say you agree.

167
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,407
Neat, my foot.

168
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,377
Rang.

169
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,917
Are you drinking?

170
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,346
You're probably
drinking wine, right?

171
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,017
How did he know that?

172
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:28,456
Soju suits you a lot
better than wine, you know.

173
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:33,496
And you're better off as a
social worker than a villain.

174
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:38,167
You could never pass
by an injured dog...

175
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,797
ever since you were young.

176
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,106
And I wondered why you
had changed so much.

177
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,307
But you haven't changed at all.

178
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,647
You haven't changed one bit.

179
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,317
So...

180
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,587
you'll be fine even
after I'm gone.

181
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,657
You jerk. How do you
expect me to be fine?

182
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:02,827
You need to be fine.

183
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:07,966
You have a family
to protect now.

184
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,867
I don't need any of them.

185
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:13,897
Stop talking back when
I'm talking to you.

186
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,407
I can already hear
you grumbling.

187
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,907
Remember what I told you in
the Forest of the Starved?

188
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:22,647
I...

189
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,617
I told you...

190
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,216
that I never once abandoned you.

191
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,097
So don't you...

192
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,196
discard yourself so recklessly.

193
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:48,567
Cherish yourself for my sake.

194
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:54,907
This is my final request.

195
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,417
Take care.

196
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:15,167
Also, this message will
explode after 10 seconds.

197
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:19,867
Just kidding.

198
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,036
I've always wanted to say that.

199
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,016
Yeon.

200
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,627
You told me to forget,

201
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:50,857
but I'll wait for you.

202
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,296
If I wish for it
desperately again and again,

203
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:57,067
maybe we'll be
able to meet again.

204
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:02,137
In my next life...

205
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:03,437
No.

206
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,276
The life after that is fine too.

207
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,877
That's why I've decided
to remember you...

208
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:15,016
and leave a record of you.

209
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,216
I'll use my skills.

210
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,196
You hadn't come for a while,
but you're coming often now.

211
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,897
I looked online, and they say
the salon is the best place...

212
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,427
to deal with losing a person.

213
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:32,097
Did you break up with someone?

214
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,137
Nothing beats sad music then.

215
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:37,536
I've tried them all.

216
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:41,407
I listened to ballads, binged
dramas, ate spicy foods...

217
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,776
Should I die my hair?

218
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:45,276
It's been a while.

219
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:54,327
I don't care how you're
doing. Get to the point.

220
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,427
What are you making?

221
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:57,927
"Tale of the Nine Tailed".

222
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:00,456
"Tale of the Nine Tailed"?

223
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,567
What a lame title.

224
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:05,296
"Tale of the Nine Tailed
Brothers". How about that?

225
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:06,736
No thank you.

226
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:09,437
You won't really
air it, will you?

227
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:13,177
It's to keep. I plan to meet
people that Yeon knew one by one.

228
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:14,847
Starting with you.

229
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:18,776
Sure. No one knows as
much about him as I do.

230
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:23,587
Okay then. Tell me everything
you know about Yeon.

231
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:27,357
Did you know that
he was a narcissist?

232
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:28,726
What?

233
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,526
All sorts of beings...

234
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:33,597
from all over the world came
to our woods to see Yeon.

235
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,667
He was already very
proud of his looks.

236
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:38,696
Imagine how much worse it got.

237
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:42,736
He always looked at his reflection
in the stream and said...

238
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:48,347
If you were to embody the
word "beautiful" into a form,

239
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,276
it would be this face.

240
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:54,917
I can't even imagine that.

241
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,817
That's as shocking as him
falling for voice phishing.

242
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,286
He fell for voice phishing?

243
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:01,556
He lost 20,000 dollars.

244
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,456
How ridiculous. A nine-tailed
fox fell for voice phishing?

245
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,597
Did you know? He's scared of
spiders because of their hairy legs.

246
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:14,097
He liked playing Go
with me the most.

247
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:15,837
Although he always lost.

248
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,147
I won!

249
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:22,546
I won again!

250
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:26,077
I guess you two were very
close a long time ago.

251
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,276
Naturally.

252
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,887
He spent much more
time with me than you.

253
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,286
Has he ever cooked for you?

254
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:37,897
He can't cook.

255
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:41,397
He's a bad cook, but he
can make rice. Only rice

256
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:50,937
He left me a video message.

257
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,077
Yeon bought me these.

258
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:54,847
He carried me on his back.

259
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,476
He waited for me
every single day.

260
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:03,617
I hate you.

261
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,256
Come to think of it,

262
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:11,696
you and I have received
so much from him.

263
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,597
Do you know what his wish was?

264
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:18,996
Human.

265
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,867
He wanted to be human.

266
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:40,256
Dear brother,

267
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:43,026
there are always
exceptions to the rules.

268
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:46,827
No.

269
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:49,667
He didn't commit suicide.
He sacrificed himself...

270
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,466
to save tens of
thousands of people.

271
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,337
There are 10 afterlife judges,
and you can't do that one thing?

272
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,337
Is King Hades that useless?

273
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,976
Hello? Hades?

274
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:02,546
Hades!

275
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,276
Hey, you!

276
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:06,716
Darn it. That jerk.

277
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:11,756
That's enough. You've
done all you could.

278
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,627
I might as well talk to a wall.

279
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:18,256
No matter how many times I talk
to him, he says the same thing.

280
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:19,496
Is he a parrot or something?

281
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,026
You'll be punished.

282
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:23,567
How is he so inflexible?

283
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,306
- Why are you laughing?
- Hearing you...

284
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:33,236
talk about being
flexible is funny.

285
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:37,917
Watch it. I've been
too lax with you.

286
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,677
Okay! Tteokbokki break!

287
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:42,147
It's spicy and mild
combined. Medium spicy.

288
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:43,246
Here.

289
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:47,117
Here. Look, they gave us
dumplings on the house.

290
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,946
When I look at you like you

291
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:19,087
I want to kiss you

292
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,026
When I'm alone
with you like this

293
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,857
I want to hold you

294
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:32,236
I love you

295
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:36,266
I love you so very much

296
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:40,236
I love you

297
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:46,016
I love you more than myself

298
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:51,716
Are you crying?

299
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,817
I'm so embarrassed.
Pretend you don't know me.

300
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,456
Yu Ri.

301
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,327
Marry me.

302
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,506
A fox loves only
one mate for life.

303
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:14,437
Will you accept my love
until the day I die?

304
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:18,647
What, with just one little ring?

305
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:22,716
I have an apartment too.
It's a new building.

306
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:27,387
If you want, I can add you...
No, I can put it in your name.

307
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,286
I don't need that.

308
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:34,456
I may bring some family with me.

309
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:35,996
If you don't mind, then...

310
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:38,466
Is that a yes?

311
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:41,167
If you didn't propose
to me, I was going to.

312
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:49,647
Congratulations!

313
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,317
You know, right? The day
you make Yu Ri cry...

314
00:27:54,317 --> 00:27:56,046
will be your funeral.

315
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:01,016
Mr. Lee.

316
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,627
Go. You lived in
luxury living with me,

317
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,556
so try suffering with him.

318
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:10,196
I took care of your fake parents.
They won't wait for you anymore.

319
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,496
I'll be happy.

320
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:13,996
Congratulations.

321
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,137
It's on me today.

322
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,077
Thank you all so much.

323
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,877
Yu Ri. Thanks.

324
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:25,446
And although he
isn't here with us,

325
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:27,716
Mr. Lee...

326
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:30,546
Thank you, and I miss you.

327
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,357
He should officiate our wedding.

328
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,657
I wish he were here with us.

329
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:53,937
Gosh.

330
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:55,506
Goodness.

331
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:09,187
Sir, can you say a
few words to Yeon?

332
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:13,796
Yeon, my wife
finally quit smoking.

333
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,427
80 percent of it
is thanks to you.

334
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,627
I wish she'll stop
nagging me too,

335
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:19,266
but that seems impossible.

336
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:21,266
There's no need to
be grumpy about it.

337
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:23,266
Ma'am, what about you?

338
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:24,667
Mr. Lee,

339
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:28,946
when I fell in love
with a human farmer,

340
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,817
you were the only
one who supported me.

341
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:35,317
You said you once
loved a mortal too.

342
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,746
Now, that same woman...

343
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:40,256
is staying strong as
she waits for you.

344
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:44,226
I hope you two can
finally meet one day...

345
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:46,627
just like me and my husband.

346
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,765
- You're here.
- Right.

347
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,196
- Come on in.
- Hae Ja.

348
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:55,266
Yes?

349
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,667
- Here you go.
- What's this?

350
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:01,306
Honey-filled rice cakes!

351
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:04,046
You love those, so...

352
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:07,216
- Isn't he handsome?
- Hello.

353
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,246
Please have a seat.

354
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,516
- Right.
- Join us.

355
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:11,857
This is great.

356
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,786
- You should try this too.
- Goodness. Thanks.

357
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,427
Thank you.

358
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:18,996
Even on the days that I
desperately missed Yeon,

359
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,696
I didn't cry anymore.

360
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:25,637
Because I knew that my tears
would conclude this story...

361
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,966
as a tragedy.

362
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:33,106
<font color="#00ff00">6 MONTHS LATER</font>

363
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:35,877
Then, on the day I
finally completed...

364
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:38,052
my very own version of
"Tale of the Nine Tailed...

365
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,544
<font color="#00ff00">"TALE OF THE NINE TAILED"</font>

366
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:43,347
As if I were imagining
things, Yeon contacted me.

367
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:44,617
The end.

368
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:46,657
Yes?

369
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,187
Ji A, hurry downstairs.

370
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:50,226
- Why?
- Come on. It's urgent.

371
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:56,226
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

372
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,696
Happy birthday, my daughter.

373
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:00,097
Was it my birthday today?

374
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:01,937
I had completely forgotten.

375
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:07,506
Happy birthday.

376
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:11,407
Here's my gift.

377
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:14,346
- It's handmade.
- Gosh, it's so pretty.

378
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:16,286
- It looks great on you.
- I love it.

379
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:17,647
Mine was made in a factory.

380
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:19,617
Thanks, Mom.

381
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,157
Did you know that my watch
strap had fallen off?

382
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:27,157
- I saw it.
- How attentive of you.

383
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,627
Anyway, thank you.

384
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,226
Who sent that one?

385
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:33,966
You should open it.

386
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:50,817
On my birthday...

387
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:52,817
What would you like as a gift?

388
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,327
Something I've never
had before in my life.

389
00:31:58,397 --> 00:31:59,996
Like a marriage proposal.

390
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,726
Sure. I'll make that happen.

391
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:07,837
It's from Yeon, right?

392
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,837
Did he come by?

393
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:12,107
A courier dropped it by.

394
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:14,437
It also came with a letter.

395
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:29,087
It was back when things
were tough for me.

396
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:33,556
I talked to my teammates and
tried to resolve the matter.

397
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,597
They suggested that we go out...

398
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,796
and helped me have a good time.

399
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:41,937
Becoming a member
of this team...

400
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:44,437
What did I say about
snacking on the couch?

401
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:45,577
I want my meal.

402
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:49,246
At least catch the
crumbs with a tray or...

403
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:50,877
Move. You're blocking the TV.

404
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,647
It was definitely hard for me.

405
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,016
Honey,

406
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,486
I told you to put your dirty
socks in the laundry basket,

407
00:32:58,486 --> 00:32:59,556
I forgot.

408
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,427
Oh, wait. The other
one's over here.

409
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:08,726
How is it that only Soo Ho
cleans up after himself?

410
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:12,437
While singing and
dancing on stage...

411
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,306
The soup is a
little salty today.

412
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:28,417
Mr. Lee, until when
will you live with us?

413
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:30,716
Are you kidding me?

414
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,617
The three of us come as a set.

415
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:37,056
I'm good with it all,
but why must I suffer...

416
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,956
in my own home?

417
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:40,756
I ordered a new kimchi fridge.

418
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:46,296
Really? The model we saw
at the department store?

419
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:50,206
Mr. Lee bought it for us. It'll
be delivered this afternoon.

420
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:52,536
- I love you, Rang!
- Rang?

421
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:55,377
I'll call you that
from now on, Rang.

422
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:56,907
I love it.

423
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:59,847
We're like one big family
now. Don't you think?

424
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:35,355
<font color="#00ff00">TO MY BELOVED JI A</font>

425
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,556
Do you like your gift?

426
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:43,887
I hope you do.

427
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:51,966
How stunning would
you be in this dress?

428
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,137
I wonder...

429
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,476
who'd get to stand beside you.

430
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:03,906
Whoever it is,

431
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,217
I wish it's someone decent.

432
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:11,047
If only I could actually
be that nonchalant.

433
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,187
But truth be told,

434
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:18,127
I already hate the guts of
this future husband of yours.

435
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:23,496
I liked you.

436
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,536
I liked how you
viewed the world.

437
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,906
Despite being born
with a terrible fate,

438
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:35,147
you never easily lost hope.

439
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:38,346
Drinking coffee with you,

440
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,947
watching you sleep,

441
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:46,616
all the paths we
walked together,

442
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:50,326
and even the time I
spent waiting for you.

443
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,426
I loved them all.

444
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:56,697
Ji A,

445
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:01,697
whenever I called your name...

446
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:04,906
that rolled easily
off my tongue,

447
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,877
butterflies filled my stomach.

448
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,706
You'll now...

449
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:14,616
have to walk those
paths without me,

450
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:17,246
but you'll get used to it.

451
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,016
You'll do well.

452
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:23,857
So please...

453
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,156
let me go now.

454
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:29,567
You must.

455
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:32,337
No.

456
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:35,706
I can't let you go.

457
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:48,417
Please come back to me.

458
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:54,286
I miss you so much.

459
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:15,576
Mister,

460
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,877
are you off to find the
nine-tailed fox again?

461
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:21,246
What did I tell you
about mentioning him?

462
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,616
Has there been any news?

463
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:26,357
I've been beating non-humans...

464
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:28,087
to see if they know anything
about how to bring him back.

465
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,127
- I'll give you a ride.
- Save it. It's cold outside anyway.

466
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,197
Hurry on home then.

467
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,027
The four of us will grill
pork belly for dinner.

468
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,667
Be safe on the road!

469
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:01,956
The key ring.

470
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,377
What brings you here?

471
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:31,516
What about you?

472
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:35,326
Rumors led me here
to that geezer.

473
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:44,415
<font color="#00ff00">FORTUNE-TELLING, PHYSIOGNOMY,
NAMING, COMPATIBILITY</font>

474
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:56,628
Are you really...

475
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,469
one of the afterlife judges?

476
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,639
I am the king of darkness.

477
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,608
I am the 10th king who rules
the Underworld of Darkness.

478
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:08,438
And I am also...

479
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:13,579
the very last judge.

480
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,659
I get to choose what happens
to you after you die.

481
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,288
You'd better sit up straight.

482
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,469
By any chance, if you have
the power to decide...

483
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,168
what happens to
us after we die...

484
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,438
Yes, that's right. I'm in
charge of reincarnation.

485
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,168
"Reincarnation"?

486
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:38,779
Then are you here
because of Yeon?

487
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,148
Well, I can't say
that's the only reason.

488
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:45,849
But I have something
that belongs to him.

489
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,788
You have the fox bead.
Give me the fox bead.

490
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:52,588
The fox bead.

491
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,259
Can this bring him back to life?

492
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,489
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

493
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,159
King Hades' sister, the
gatekeeper of the Samdo River,

494
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,228
kept calling the afterlife
judges, so that's why I'm here.

495
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,438
but we don't do charity work.

496
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:10,768
You both know the rules, right?

497
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,708
We need to give you the one thing
that's most precious to us, right?

498
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,748
I'll do it. I can do it.

499
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:21,018
As long as Yeon
comes back to life.

500
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,889
But what if you're not
able to meet him...

501
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,148
even if he comes back?

502
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:29,389
- What?
- People get reincarnated randomly.

503
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:31,529
It means you could cross paths.

504
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,128
He could get reincarnated
after you both die.

505
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,998
And he might be born with
a different appearance.

506
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:42,568
I don't care.

507
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:48,878
Let's start the deal.

508
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,279
Okay then.

509
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,688
Go ahead and bring me
something enticing...

510
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,588
before the sandglass stops.

511
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,779
- What's the matter?
- The king of darkness is here.

512
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,918
No wonder something felt
unusual. He's finally here.

513
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,398
That's a crow crying.

514
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:50,568
It cried three times.

515
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,038
I see people in
mourning clothes.

516
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,949
It looks like there
will be another death.

517
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:05,389
I'll do it.

518
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:08,418
Tell me what you can give me.

519
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,659
The person I cherish
the most is Yeon.

520
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:16,568
But he's no longer here,
and my memories of him...

521
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:18,199
are all I have left.

522
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,369
I will sell you my memories.

523
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,568
I don't buy memories.

524
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,739
Forget that.

525
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,248
You have something else
that you received from him.

526
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,079
I'll give you anything.
Just tell me what you want.

527
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,918
For example,

528
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,148
the rest of your life.

529
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:47,829
If I give you my life,

530
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,568
- can Yeon get reincarnated?
- Hey.

531
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:56,168
If you want his life,
you can sacrifice yours.

532
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,338
There's no question about that.

533
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:11,418
I'll give it to you.

534
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:14,989
Hey, do you think Yeon saved
you just so you could...

535
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,228
cast away your life like that?

536
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:19,998
He didn't die for nothing,
you know. You're so pathetic.

537
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:24,068
Then will you give me your life?

538
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:36,049
Sure. I stole
people's lives anyway,

539
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:38,708
- so I have no regrets.
- Hey.

540
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,478
- Stay out of it.
- But...

541
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,688
if I remember correctly,
you had no will to live.

542
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:47,389
That makes your life worthless.

543
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:50,259
First, let's take a look
and check your worth.

544
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:07,009
Interesting.

545
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:11,909
It looks like you've
got yourself a family.

546
00:44:13,148 --> 00:44:15,279
Now you're cherishing your life.

547
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,119
You pass.

548
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:23,188
We have a deal.

549
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,128
Deal.

550
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:27,659
- No!
- Wait.

551
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,498
We still have time.

552
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,369
Can you call the guys?

553
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:44,579
At least let me say goodbye.

554
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:01,099
This way.

555
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:30,659
Mr. Lee!

556
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,159
Mr. Lee!

557
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,929
Mr. Lee!

558
00:46:57,549 --> 00:46:58,608
Oh, my gosh.

559
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:01,049
Oh, my goodness.

560
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:32,409
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

561
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:55,498
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

562
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:33,599
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

563
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,618
- Ms. Nam.
- Yes?

564
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,748
Take this.

565
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,429
Where did you get this?

566
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,799
I'm not sure. Someone
dropped it off...

567
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:00,859
to give it to you.

568
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:03,168
- When?
- It was before my shift,

569
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:04,699
so about five minutes ago?

570
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:16,049
But...

571
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:44,409
Yeon.

572
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:48,578
I'm sorry.

573
00:51:45,098 --> 00:51:46,938
I told you not to
walk in the rain.

574
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:49,168
Yeon.

575
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,668
Is it really you?

576
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:57,549
You're not in disguise.
Isn't it a dream?

577
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:00,049
It's really you?

578
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:05,549
Then why are you standing there?

579
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:08,659
Why won't you come to me?

580
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:11,989
I'm not the same
person I used to be.

581
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:14,728
What do you mean?

582
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,168
I can't even fly.

583
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:21,739
Even if you fall from a high
place, I can't catch you.

584
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:26,279
Even if your path is dark,
I can't send fireflies.

585
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,009
It hurts if I get hit.

586
00:52:31,049 --> 00:52:32,449
I get wounded if I get stabbed.

587
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:39,788
There's nothing
I can do for you.

588
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,069
It doesn't matter.

589
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,609
I don't need any of that.

590
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:04,748
I've become human.

591
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:12,118
Human?

592
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:20,359
You're in trouble now.

593
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:23,399
I won't let you go
until the day you die.

594
00:53:31,569 --> 00:53:33,339
I've missed you so much.

595
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:36,279
So much, that I thought I
was going to lose my mind.

596
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,879
I was terrified that
I'd never see you again.

597
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,168
How did you do it?

598
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:08,409
What?

599
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:12,848
6 months felt like
6 years for me.

600
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:15,478
How did you wait for 600 years?

601
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:18,618
Do you develop a skill...

602
00:54:18,618 --> 00:54:21,118
and get used to it if
you wait long enough?

603
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:24,728
I didn't get used to waiting.

604
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:28,659
I just couldn't get used
to being apart from you.

605
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:36,708
I wanted to be strong
like you as I waited,

606
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:39,938
but little things held me
back and knocked me over.

607
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:43,208
Like what? What
tormented you so much?

608
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:44,649
For example,

609
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:50,089
the night air from one night
when you walked me home.

610
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:54,018
The alarm from our rice cooker.

611
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:58,659
Remembering how warm your hands
were when we went for a walk.

612
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,558
Those little memories.

613
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,498
That's why...

614
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:07,699
you found me this time.

615
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:10,808
You found me.

616
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,748
These are real human hands now.

617
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:20,449
Yes. And a human body.

618
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:25,089
And human lips.

619
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,379
No. He isn't going
to sing there, is he?

620
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:56,049
- No...
- When I look at you like you

621
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,118
I want to kiss you

622
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,359
When I'm alone
with you like this

623
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:08,659
Sir, can you say a
few words to Yeon?

624
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,969
Yeon, my wife
finally quit smoking.

625
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:14,538
80 percent of it
is thanks to you.

626
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:16,038
Ma'am, what about you?

627
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:19,469
When I fell in love
with a human farmer,

628
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:22,009
you were the only
one who supported me.

629
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,509
You said you once
loved a mortal too.

630
00:56:24,909 --> 00:56:27,618
Now, that same woman
is staying strong...

631
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,279
as she waits for you.

632
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:32,348
I hope you two can
finally meet one day...

633
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,458
You should try this too.

634
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:36,489
I want fish too. Fish.

635
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:39,129
- I'll bring you some more.
- I'll get it.

636
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,558
Let's eat baeksuk
after our walk.

637
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:10,629
Are you happy?

638
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:17,899
<font color="#00ff00">SHUNJU ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

639
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:24,569
Mr. Lee!

640
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,109
Mr. Lee!

641
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:28,509
Mr. Lee!

642
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:42,989
How's the apartment? Livable?

643
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,659
You don't know the half of
it. They provide everything.

644
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:46,998
A sauna, a gym...

645
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:49,359
It's definitely worth more
than its current price.

646
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:50,828
There are even two
railway stations close by.

647
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:53,399
You're quite
materialistic for a fox.

648
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:56,168
I'm the manager of the
resident association.

649
00:57:58,168 --> 00:57:59,978
So were you able...

650
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,038
to cherish me more
during my absence?

651
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:05,549
I've been enjoying being
a newlywed to miss you.

652
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,679
Then I'm leaving.

653
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:10,188
Just kidding.

654
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:14,659
Being human comes with mood swings,
so be careful with what you say.

655
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,458
This is the first time I
feel inferior to anyone.

656
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:20,629
Saying that with your face will
earn you a smack on the head.

657
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:25,199
Anyway, I'm glad you're back.

658
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:30,368
In our own ways, we've been
coping with your death...

659
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:31,668
while awaiting your return.

660
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:35,679
Sometimes, we whined and
leaned on each other.

661
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:45,949
And Rang?

662
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:51,958
He was a total wreck
from the day you left.

663
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,899
He cried all night for a month.

664
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:56,668
Things got better after
he moved in with us,

665
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:59,429
but he kept searching for you.

666
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:04,808
Were you with him
at his final moment?

667
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,248
He would've been so scared.

668
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:24,029
Despite what people think,
he gets scared easily.

669
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:31,629
Here's his phone.

670
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:33,739
Take a look.

671
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,739
It's me.

672
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,078
I'll be dead soon.

673
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:23,589
If you were here, you'd
come to rescue me.

674
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,288
Since you can't,
I'm totally doomed.

675
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,759
Anyway, this is payback...

676
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:33,759
for your final message to me.

677
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:38,668
I thought it'd feel
different to face death,

678
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:43,339
but maybe you're right
about me easily giving up.

679
01:00:44,538 --> 01:00:46,038
I'm sad but relieved in a way.

680
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:49,078
So...

681
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:52,909
don't you be a fool
and cry over my death.

682
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:56,989
I never once cried
in your absence.

683
01:00:58,348 --> 01:01:00,018
All I did was get drunk.

684
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:01,288
You liar.

685
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,058
I've been causing you
trouble for years,

686
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:11,069
but I won't apologize since
you're the bigger jerk.

687
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:17,509
Whenever we split a fruit, you
always gave me the bigger piece.

688
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,679
Despite your
obsession with eggs,

689
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:23,679
you always let me have yours.

690
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:30,418
So how could I not hate you for
choosing the girl over me...

691
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:32,018
after I've grown
accustomed to you?

692
01:01:36,618 --> 01:01:38,759
I'm going to be reborn
as a humpback shrimp,

693
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,199
so don't eat them just in case.

694
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:53,578
I hope...

695
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,779
you'll be reincarnated too.

696
01:02:09,618 --> 01:02:12,259
Preferably with an ugly face.

697
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:19,668
Still...

698
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:22,969
Still,

699
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:25,909
if we can,

700
01:02:28,438 --> 01:02:30,038
let's meet again.

701
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,018
My brother.

702
01:02:58,538 --> 01:02:59,538
My brother...

703
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:18,558
Kim Soo Ho, you don't
have parents, do you?

704
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,529
I heard that your mom ran away.

705
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:22,058
No, she didn't.

706
01:03:22,058 --> 01:03:23,728
He lives in a shabby house too.

707
01:03:24,098 --> 01:03:26,129
I saw it when we were
in the same class.

708
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:30,367
- You're a homeless beggar
- You're a homeless beggar

709
01:03:30,368 --> 01:03:32,238
- You're a homeless beggar
- You're a homeless beggar

710
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:33,538
- You're a homeless beggar
- Soo Ho!

711
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:38,609
Let's go home.

712
01:03:40,348 --> 01:03:41,679
And we're not beggars.

713
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:45,418
Come on.

714
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,558
Wasn't that perfect timing?

715
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:56,998
Rang unexpectedly
did good deeds,

716
01:03:57,598 --> 01:04:01,038
and it was passed
down unexpectedly.

717
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:13,149
Still, in a slightly
uncanny way,

718
01:04:14,348 --> 01:04:15,879
love is passed on.

719
01:04:47,978 --> 01:04:50,819
My hands fit right
on your shoulders.

720
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:54,918
Yeon!

721
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,069
I missed you, Granny.

722
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,768
Don't be a drama
queen. It's tacky.

723
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:12,868
I heard you pulled some
strings to get me out.

724
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:14,578
Me?

725
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:18,109
She made at least 200 calls.

726
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:20,649
Her brother ended up
blocking her number.

727
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,288
You couldn't live
without me, right?

728
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:27,688
Shove off.

729
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:31,058
I will soon, anyway.

730
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:34,498
This will be the last
day you see my face.

731
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:36,929
How so?

732
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:39,668
I can't be back here now
that I've become human.

733
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,199
I should live among them.

734
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:45,938
You'll only see him
once he's dead now.

735
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:48,478
Why would you say that
and jinx his life?

736
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,909
Don't you know how hard
it was to get him back?

737
01:05:51,478 --> 01:05:55,149
Thank you for adoring
a troublemaker like me.

738
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:59,418
You kept me busy
until Ji A returned...

739
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,518
so that I wouldn't lose my mind.

740
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:06,629
Because of you and Hyeonuiong,

741
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:09,359
I've made it this far.

742
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:12,929
Have a good life, Yeon.
Living as a mortal...

743
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:15,368
isn't as easy as it sounds,

744
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,538
but I'm sure you'll
do a good job.

745
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:19,538
Sure.

746
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:23,308
I wish you both live a
long and healthy life.

747
01:06:26,078 --> 01:06:27,149
I'll get going then.

748
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:32,918
Hey!

749
01:06:35,518 --> 01:06:39,458
Since you're here, stuff
yourself with some tteokbokki.

750
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:43,159
Am I supposed to
get some for you?

751
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:45,029
- Must you ask?
- Right.

752
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:51,909
Darn, it's spicy.

753
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:56,538
How is this spicy? Unbelievable.

754
01:06:56,538 --> 01:06:58,748
I got medium level spiciness,
but it's still very spicy to me.

755
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:00,578
Sundae is good.

756
01:07:00,578 --> 01:07:03,918
Like she has always been,
Granny is still a workaholic.

757
01:07:03,918 --> 01:07:04,949
I like the fish cake.

758
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:07,589
- Only one thing changed.
- The fish cake is to die for.

759
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:11,558
Now, the married couple
sometimes stay up all night...

760
01:07:11,788 --> 01:07:13,489
talking about
their deceased son.

761
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:17,899
Also, tteokbokki with a
medium level of spiciness...

762
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,438
is said to be somewhat
enjoyable too.

763
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,009
Gosh, it's spicy.

764
01:07:56,963 --> 01:07:59,662
Well, I don't know...

765
01:08:00,362 --> 01:08:02,173
if love really lasts forever.

766
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:06,673
But you like drumsticks,
and I like chicken breasts.

767
01:08:07,942 --> 01:08:10,812
You like egg yolks,
and I like egg whites.

768
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:14,383
Therefore, that makes
us the perfect couple.

769
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:17,353
You're probably the first
woman who confesses love...

770
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,183
with chicken and eggs.

771
01:08:23,862 --> 01:08:26,763
We're finally getting married.

772
01:08:29,662 --> 01:08:32,202
And you've finally become human.

773
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:37,973
The Korean word "human"
is very interesting to me.

774
01:08:38,902 --> 01:08:42,872
If you carve away the corners
of the final consonant,

775
01:08:43,442 --> 01:08:44,713
that word turns into "love".

776
01:08:47,213 --> 01:08:48,353
You see,

777
01:08:49,353 --> 01:08:51,883
I don't have the
best personality,

778
01:08:52,452 --> 01:08:54,353
and I'm not sure if
I'll do a good job...

779
01:08:56,593 --> 01:08:57,822
of living as a human being,

780
01:09:00,162 --> 01:09:02,362
but I know I will love
you more than anything.

781
01:09:10,372 --> 01:09:11,473
I love you.

782
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:13,043
I love you too.

783
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:37,702
What? What's with the
raining flowers in fall?

784
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:40,933
They're congratulating him.

785
01:09:41,902 --> 01:09:44,343
The flowers, trees, and wind...

786
01:09:44,803 --> 01:09:46,772
are saying goodbye...

787
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:49,173
to their beloved master.

788
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:53,612
They're thanking him for how
much he took care of them.

789
01:10:54,343 --> 01:10:57,112
And the extremely handsome
nine tailed fox...

790
01:10:57,112 --> 01:10:59,013
lived happily ever after.

791
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:01,853
Hey, stop narrating
it your own way.

792
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:05,452
I'm married to a director,
so I only state facts.

793
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:08,022
- Turn it around.
- Okay.

794
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,202
Should we have a baby?

795
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:32,112
I'd love to.

796
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:34,513
But there's something
that worries me.

797
01:11:35,112 --> 01:11:36,213
What is it?

798
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:38,583
What if our daughter thinks
I'm an embarrassment...

799
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,322
for not having
graduated college?

800
01:11:42,893 --> 01:11:47,463
Then we can tell her you did
something even more amazing.

801
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:54,232
- And what's that?
- That you saved my life...

802
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:56,173
and the entire world,

803
01:11:56,173 --> 01:11:57,772
although no one really
knows that part.

804
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:00,173
Well, it's the truth.

805
01:12:02,513 --> 01:12:05,183
But who says we're going
to have a daughter?

806
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:08,412
- Did I say "daughter"?
- Yes.

807
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:10,652
That's weird. That can't be.

808
01:12:11,282 --> 01:12:13,982
<font color="#00ff00">SHIN JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

809
01:12:18,062 --> 01:12:20,593
Be honest with me. How
does it feel to be human?

810
01:12:20,732 --> 01:12:21,992
Is it better than being a fox?

811
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:25,463
I thought it'd be really
nice, but I was wrong.

812
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:27,402
How should I say this?

813
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:30,232
There are so many variables.

814
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,442
"Variables"?

815
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:39,612
Apparently, I have astigmatism.
And it's different in each eye.

816
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:42,183
Look.

817
01:12:44,522 --> 01:12:45,622
This makes me look...

818
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:48,753
a lot less handsome in no time.

819
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:56,593
If you compare the
two of us right now,

820
01:12:57,763 --> 01:12:58,963
I think I look a
bit more handsome.

821
01:12:59,532 --> 01:13:01,272
- That's not true.
- You're right.

822
01:13:03,702 --> 01:13:07,003
And that's not the only problem.

823
01:13:11,383 --> 01:13:12,583
Did you lie to me?

824
01:13:13,043 --> 01:13:14,753
You told me we're
going to eat ice cream.

825
01:13:14,753 --> 01:13:16,213
I didn't lie to
you. I told you...

826
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:17,683
we need to go somewhere
before we eat.

827
01:13:18,883 --> 01:13:21,492
I'd rather get
stabbed by a knife.

828
01:13:21,492 --> 01:13:23,053
I really can't
stand anesthetics.

829
01:13:23,723 --> 01:13:25,492
- Be a good boy.
- Let me go.

830
01:13:26,263 --> 01:13:27,562
How can your love
change like this?

831
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,532
What are you talking about?

832
01:13:31,402 --> 01:13:34,633
Root canal treatment was
literally the worst thing ever.

833
01:13:35,973 --> 01:13:37,442
Living as a human
being is about...

834
01:13:37,772 --> 01:13:39,673
fighting against
unexpected kinds of pain.

835
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:41,812
Ta-da.

836
01:13:46,883 --> 01:13:48,213
What do you think? Is it good?

837
01:13:48,213 --> 01:13:50,553
You cook the best instant
noodles in this entire world.

838
01:13:51,822 --> 01:13:53,383
Honey, do we have soju?

839
01:13:53,822 --> 01:13:55,152
Of course.

840
01:13:55,152 --> 01:13:56,692
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

841
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,362
You worked so hard today.

842
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:05,732
You did too.

843
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:09,103
Instant noodles and soju. This is
what's so nice about being human.

844
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:05,463
The next time you fall,

845
01:15:06,062 --> 01:15:07,963
try to get back up
on your own, okay?

846
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,362
Here.

847
01:15:14,202 --> 01:15:15,673
Thank you.

848
01:15:37,562 --> 01:15:39,992
- Did you fall?
- Yes.

849
01:15:40,192 --> 01:15:42,133
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

850
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:43,862
You should've been more careful.

851
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,662
Does it not hurt?

852
01:15:45,662 --> 01:15:47,803
No, this man helped me get up.

853
01:15:50,942 --> 01:15:52,872
He didn't get to be reborn
as a humpback shrimp.

854
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:14,162
How was your day?

855
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:15,963
It was the same old.

856
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:21,202
I saw someone strange at
the police station today.

857
01:16:21,732 --> 01:16:22,772
Why did that person
look strange?

858
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,643
He was an old man
wearing a Hahoe mask.

859
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,973
But that mask wouldn't
come off his face.

860
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:29,043
It was as if it was stuck there.

861
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,112
A Hahoe mask?

862
01:16:31,442 --> 01:16:34,143
By any chance, did you
step on bird poop today?

863
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:37,353
No, not bird poop.

864
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:39,423
I did step on gum though.

865
01:16:39,753 --> 01:16:41,093
Darn it.

866
01:16:41,192 --> 01:16:42,223
Why?

867
01:16:42,353 --> 01:16:44,463
He's a spirit of misfortune.

868
01:16:44,793 --> 01:16:45,963
Misfortune?

869
01:16:45,963 --> 01:16:48,593
<font color="#00ff00">MISFORTUNE THAT COMES TO HUMANS

870
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,803
There may be entities
that we are unaware of...

871
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:58,473
cohabitating in
this world with us.

872
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:02,013
Perhaps those countless urban
legends that circulate...

873
01:17:02,513 --> 01:17:04,482
are just stories about them.

874
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:08,112
I've overheard the secrets...

875
01:17:08,513 --> 01:17:09,982
of the world.

876
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:25,902
Living as a human being means...

877
01:17:26,732 --> 01:17:30,202
that life is full of firsts...

878
01:17:30,603 --> 01:17:32,043
and lasts.

879
01:17:33,143 --> 01:17:35,942
First snowfall. First step.

880
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:37,982
First picnic.

881
01:17:39,282 --> 01:17:40,812
First root canal.

882
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:47,223
And...

883
01:17:48,423 --> 01:17:49,423
Forever...

884
01:17:50,423 --> 01:17:51,723
my first love.

885
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,393
Hey, you.

886
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:13,673
Are you the spirit
of misfortune?

887
