1
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,716
Once you fall into
the Samdo River,

2
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,987
you'll never be
able to come back.

3
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:17,627
No.

4
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:23,996
I love you.

5
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:26,397
No!

6
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:28,566
No!

7
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:07,777
Yeon!

8
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,997
Don't leave me.

9
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,937
Yeon!

10
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:12,277
I can hear her crying.

11
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:14,747
Yeon!

12
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,147
I must tell her...

13
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,846
that she shouldn't be so sad...

14
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,816
and that the love story
of a human and fox...

15
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:29,356
always ends this way.

16
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:36,826
From the beginning,

17
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,837
we belonged in two
different worlds.

18
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,277
Using our love as a bridge,

19
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,647
I wished to cross
over to her world.

20
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,876
I wished to be with her longer.

21
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:02,487
I wished to be a mortal.

22
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,256
My dreams...

23
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:09,566
never came true,

24
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,096
but my death...

25
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,267
is the most...

26
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,807
passionate love letter...

27
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:24,217
sent to my first and last love.

28
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,747
I hope...

29
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,217
that she doesn't wait for me.

30
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:36,126
I hope she doesn't cry too much.

31
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:41,166
And I'd give anything to
see her one last time.

32
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,446
I...

33
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,047
no longer can see her face.

34
00:04:55,878 --> 00:05:01,492
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 16: THE REWRITTEN
TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

35
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:25,896
Jae Hwan.

36
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:27,607
Ms. Kim?

37
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,136
Ms. Kim!

38
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,237
- Hold on.
- Are you all right?

39
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,537
Well...

40
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:38,547
Could a miracle actually
exist in this world?

41
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:43,747
The unknown contagious disease
that drove people to fear...

42
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,386
vanished as of last night.

43
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,526
Patients of this puzzling disease
and their family members...

44
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,696
who had no choice but
to succumb to it...

45
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,566
embraced with each
other with tears of joy.

46
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:31,437
Finally, everything has
come back to normal.

47
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:33,766
I couldn't...

48
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,466
save Yeon.

49
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,907
Once again, I lost a
young man I adored.

50
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:44,747
That's not true. You did
everything you could...

51
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,287
to help Yeon.

52
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:52,956
That's why I came back to you.

53
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,966
I hope Yeon didn't suffer.

54
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,737
He probably didn't.

55
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,266
He saved the girl which
is all that he wished.

56
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:27,586
Mr. Hyeonuiong.

57
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,157
Mr. Hyeonuiong!

58
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,396
It's Ji A, please open the door.

59
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,836
What do I do?

60
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:39,037
Don't open the door for her.

61
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:40,437
But...

62
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,107
She should forget about Yeon...

63
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,037
and live an ordinary
life among others.

64
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,547
Please tell me...

65
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,977
what I need to do to save Yeon.

66
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,816
Tell me what I can do.

67
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,316
Can you please...

68
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:03,657
just tell me what I should do?

69
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,506
Mr. Hyeonuiong.

70
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,336
Please open the door.

71
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:20,937
Please.

72
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:24,876
Why can't we just open the door?

73
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:25,777
Rang!

74
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,437
Mr. Lee, should I
buy you naengmyeon?

75
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:53,966
Get out.

76
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,907
You haven't eaten anything
but alcohol for three days.

77
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,476
I said get out.

78
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,807
It wasn't your fault.

79
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:03,746
You just did what
Yeon asked you to do.

80
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,946
Say one more word
and I'll kill you.

81
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:14,287
Do you want stickers?

82
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,826
I have a really cool car too.

83
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,257
Will both of you just get
lost? Get out of my house!

84
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,596
Thank you for letting me in.

85
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,836
I have no time to console
your broken heart,

86
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:03,037
so I'll just get to the point.

87
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,507
Yeon is dead.

88
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,037
You can't do anything
to bring him back.

89
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:09,677
I may not be able to do
anything, but you can.

90
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,377
You have control over life and
death so there must be something...

91
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:14,417
We also have rules
in this world.

92
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:17,316
There are things that
just can't be done.

93
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:20,086
Then at least let
him get reincarnated.

94
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,326
I don't care if he
doesn't recognize me.

95
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,557
I'm fine even if he forgets
everything about me, so please...

96
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,927
Yeon willingly chose to
jump into the Samdo River.

97
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,267
He knew he wouldn't be
able to be reincarnated,

98
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,966
but he still chose to do so.

99
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,466
So stop protesting in
front of my office.

100
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,037
You can't undo what's been
done by throwing a tantrum.

101
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:40,076
No, I'm sure there's a way.

102
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,307
There must be a way
to bring Yeon back.

103
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,407
That will...

104
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,976
never happen.

105
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:49,316
I let you in to tell you that.

106
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,356
Ma'am.

107
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,887
Ma'am, wait. Ma'am.

108
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,196
It's so dark.

109
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,137
The street lamps are out.

110
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,066
It would be so cool if you
could use your powers...

111
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,606
to fix them.

112
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,877
Submit a request to
the local authority.

113
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:52,417
Are you okay?

114
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,986
The street lamps are on again.

115
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,986
I called the local authority.

116
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,787
You didn't have to do that.

117
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:06,557
If you get hurt, I'll get
an earful from Mr. Lee.

118
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:09,767
Dr. Koo.

119
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:11,966
Are you okay?

120
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,907
I need to be okay
even if I'm not.

121
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,736
I have a lot to do.

122
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:24,076
I just met the gatekeeper
of the Samdo River.

123
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,147
She told me there's no
way to save Mr. Lee.

124
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,047
Yeon knew this would
happen from the very start.

125
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:34,787
But he still chose to sacrifice
himself for the woman he loved.

126
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:39,657
What am I supposed to do?

127
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,696
Just live your life like
nothing ever happened.

128
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,807
Forget having met Mr. Lee...

129
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,137
and everything you saw
regarding our world,

130
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,236
and live a normal life.

131
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,677
That's what he wants for you.

132
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,226
Shin Ju.

133
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,226
- Is he still inside?
- He won't even budge.

134
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:18,596
I'm worried he might collapse.

135
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,297
Let me talk to him.

136
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,486
- Why are you being like this?
- Isn't it obvious?

137
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:40,986
This won't bring Mr. Lee back.

138
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,986
I can't believe
you just said that.

139
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,326
But you look completely fine.

140
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:51,397
You always acted like you could
sacrifice your life for him.

141
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,336
You're an ungrateful
piece of trash.

142
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:55,907
You can call me
whatever you want.

143
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,407
But I need to say this to you.

144
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,336
Save the darn lecture and
give me back my alcohol.

145
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,677
Get it together.

146
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:02,907
You crazy punk.

147
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:04,677
Stop acting like a baby
and start living your life.

148
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:09,216
- Do you have a death wish?
- Mr. Lee told me to tell you that.

149
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:23,096
You can go ahead and
listen to the rest.

150
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,757
Is this working?
Okay, there we go.

151
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:49,927
Hey, it's me.

152
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,826
We just had naengmyeon together.

153
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,966
And you ate my egg.

154
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:02,007
If you're watching this,

155
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,377
I'm probably no longer alive.

156
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:08,976
My gosh.

157
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,476
This is so corny.

158
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,346
This kind of stuff
looked cool in movies.

159
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,986
I'm sure it'll be neat
enough to keep as a keepsake.

160
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,326
Say you agree.

161
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:25,157
Neat, my foot.

162
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,127
Rang.

163
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,667
Are you drinking?

164
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,096
You're probably
drinking wine, right?

165
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:35,767
How did he know that?

166
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,206
Soju suits you a lot
better than wine, you know.

167
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:44,246
And you're better off as a
social worker than a villain.

168
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,917
You could never pass
by an injured dog...

169
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,547
ever since you were young.

170
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,856
And I wondered why you
had changed so much.

171
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,057
But you haven't changed at all.

172
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,397
You haven't changed one bit.

173
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,067
So...

174
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,337
you'll be fine even
after I'm gone.

175
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,407
You jerk. How do you
expect me to be fine?

176
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,577
You need to be fine.

177
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:18,716
You have a family
to protect now.

178
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,617
I don't need any of them.

179
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,647
Stop talking back when
I'm talking to you.

180
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,157
I can already hear
you grumbling.

181
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,657
Remember what I told you in
the Forest of the Starved?

182
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,397
I...

183
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:39,367
I told you...

184
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,966
that I never once abandoned you.

185
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:52,847
So don't you...

186
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:55,946
discard yourself so recklessly.

187
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,317
Cherish yourself for my sake.

188
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:05,657
This is my final request.

189
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,167
Take care.

190
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,917
Also, this message will
explode after 10 seconds.

191
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,617
Just kidding.

192
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,786
I've always wanted to say that.

193
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:55,766
Yeon.

194
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,377
You told me to forget,

195
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,607
but I'll wait for you.

196
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:05,046
If I wish for it
desperately again and again,

197
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:07,817
maybe we'll be
able to meet again.

198
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,887
In my next life...

199
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:14,187
No.

200
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,026
The life after that is fine too.

201
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:23,627
That's why I've decided
to remember you...

202
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,766
and leave a record of you.

203
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:28,966
I'll use my skills.

204
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,946
You hadn't come for a while,
but you're coming often now.

205
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:39,647
I looked online, and they say
the salon is the best place...

206
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:41,177
to deal with losing a person.

207
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:42,847
Did you break up with someone?

208
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,887
Nothing beats sad music then.

209
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:48,286
I've tried them all.

210
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:52,157
I listened to ballads, binged
dramas, ate spicy foods...

211
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,526
Should I die my hair?

212
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:56,026
It's been a while.

213
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:05,077
I don't care how you're
doing. Get to the point.

214
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,177
What are you making?

215
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:08,677
"Tale of the Nine Tailed".

216
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:11,206
"Tale of the Nine Tailed"?

217
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,317
What a lame title.

218
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,046
"Tale of the Nine Tailed
Brothers". How about that?

219
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:17,486
No thank you.

220
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,187
You won't really
air it, will you?

221
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:23,927
It's to keep. I plan to meet
people that Yeon knew one by one.

222
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,597
Starting with you.

223
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:29,526
Sure. No one knows as
much about him as I do.

224
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:34,337
Okay then. Tell me everything
you know about Yeon.

225
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,107
Did you know that
he was a narcissist?

226
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:39,476
What?

227
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:41,276
All sorts of beings...

228
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:44,347
from all over the world came
to our woods to see Yeon.

229
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,417
He was already very
proud of his looks.

230
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,446
Imagine how much worse it got.

231
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:53,486
He always looked at his reflection
in the stream and said...

232
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:59,097
If you were to embody the
word "beautiful" into a form,

233
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:01,026
it would be this face.

234
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,667
I can't even imagine that.

235
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,567
That's as shocking as him
falling for voice phishing.

236
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,036
He fell for voice phishing?

237
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:12,306
He lost 20,000 dollars.

238
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,206
How ridiculous. A nine-tailed
fox fell for voice phishing?

239
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:20,347
Did you know? He's scared of
spiders because of their hairy legs.

240
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:24,847
He liked playing Go
with me the most.

241
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:26,587
Although he always lost.

242
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:31,897
I won!

243
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,296
I won again!

244
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:36,827
I guess you two were very
close a long time ago.

245
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,026
Naturally.

246
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,637
He spent much more
time with me than you.

247
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,036
Has he ever cooked for you?

248
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:48,647
He can't cook.

249
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,147
He's a bad cook, but he
can make rice. Only rice

250
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:01,687
He left me a video message.

251
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:03,827
Yeon bought me these.

252
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,597
He carried me on his back.

253
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,226
He waited for me
every single day.

254
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,367
I hate you.

255
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:19,006
Come to think of it,

256
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,446
you and I have received
so much from him.

257
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,347
Do you know what his wish was?

258
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:29,746
Human.

259
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,617
He wanted to be human.

260
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,006
Dear brother,

261
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:53,776
there are always
exceptions to the rules.

262
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,577
No.

263
00:23:57,577 --> 00:24:00,417
He didn't commit suicide.
He sacrificed himself...

264
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,216
to save tens of
thousands of people.

265
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:07,087
There are 10 afterlife judges,
and you can't do that one thing?

266
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,087
Is King Hades that useless?

267
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,726
Hello? Hades?

268
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:13,296
Hades!

269
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:15,026
Hey, you!

270
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:17,466
Darn it. That jerk.

271
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:22,506
That's enough. You've
done all you could.

272
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:25,377
I might as well talk to a wall.

273
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:29,006
No matter how many times I talk
to him, he says the same thing.

274
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:30,246
Is he a parrot or something?

275
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:31,776
You'll be punished.

276
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:34,317
How is he so inflexible?

277
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:41,056
- Why are you laughing?
- Hearing you...

278
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:43,986
talk about being
flexible is funny.

279
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,667
Watch it. I've been
too lax with you.

280
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,427
Okay! Tteokbokki break!

281
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,897
It's spicy and mild
combined. Medium spicy.

282
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:53,996
Here.

283
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:57,867
Here. Look, they gave us
dumplings on the house.

284
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:25,696
When I look at you like you

285
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:29,837
I want to kiss you

286
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:34,776
When I'm alone
with you like this

287
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:38,607
I want to hold you

288
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:42,986
I love you

289
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:47,016
I love you so very much

290
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,986
I love you

291
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:56,766
I love you more than myself

292
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:02,466
Are you crying?

293
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:04,567
I'm so embarrassed.
Pretend you don't know me.

294
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:08,206
Yu Ri.

295
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,077
Marry me.

296
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:19,256
A fox loves only
one mate for life.

297
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:25,187
Will you accept my love
until the day I die?

298
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,397
What, with just one little ring?

299
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,466
I have an apartment too.
It's a new building.

300
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:38,137
If you want, I can add you...
No, I can put it in your name.

301
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:42,036
I don't need that.

302
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:45,206
I may bring some family with me.

303
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,746
If you don't mind, then...

304
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,216
Is that a yes?

305
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:51,917
If you didn't propose
to me, I was going to.

306
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,397
Congratulations!

307
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:05,067
You know, right? The day
you make Yu Ri cry...

308
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:06,796
will be your funeral.

309
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:11,766
Mr. Lee.

310
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:15,377
Go. You lived in
luxury living with me,

311
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,306
so try suffering with him.

312
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,946
I took care of your fake parents.
They won't wait for you anymore.

313
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:22,246
I'll be happy.

314
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:24,746
Congratulations.

315
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:27,887
It's on me today.

316
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,827
Thank you all so much.

317
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,627
Yu Ri. Thanks.

318
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:36,196
And although he
isn't here with us,

319
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:38,466
Mr. Lee...

320
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,296
Thank you, and I miss you.

321
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:45,107
He should officiate our wedding.

322
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:48,407
I wish he were here with us.

323
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:04,687
Gosh.

324
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:06,256
Goodness.

325
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:19,937
Sir, can you say a
few words to Yeon?

326
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,546
Yeon, my wife
finally quit smoking.

327
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,177
80 percent of it
is thanks to you.

328
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:28,377
I wish she'll stop
nagging me too,

329
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,016
but that seems impossible.

330
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,016
There's no need to
be grumpy about it.

331
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,016
Ma'am, what about you?

332
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,417
Mr. Lee,

333
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:39,696
when I fell in love
with a human farmer,

334
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:43,567
you were the only
one who supported me.

335
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,067
You said you once
loved a mortal too.

336
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:48,496
Now, that same woman...

337
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:51,006
is staying strong as
she waits for you.

338
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:54,976
I hope you two can
finally meet one day...

339
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:57,377
just like me and my husband.

340
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,515
- You're here.
- Right.

341
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:04,946
- Come on in.
- Hae Ja.

342
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,016
Yes?

343
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:08,417
- Here you go.
- What's this?

344
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:12,056
Honey-filled rice cakes!

345
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:14,796
You love those, so...

346
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,966
- Isn't he handsome?
- Hello.

347
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:19,996
Please have a seat.

348
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,266
- Right.
- Join us.

349
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,607
This is great.

350
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,536
- You should try this too.
- Goodness. Thanks.

351
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:27,177
Thank you.

352
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,746
Even on the days that I
desperately missed Yeon,

353
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:32,446
I didn't cry anymore.

354
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:36,387
Because I knew that my tears
would conclude this story...

355
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,716
as a tragedy.

356
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,856
<font color="#00ff00">6 MONTHS LATER</font>

357
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,627
Then, on the day I
finally completed...

358
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:48,802
my very own version of
"Tale of the Nine Tailed...

359
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,294
<font color="#00ff00">"TALE OF THE NINE TAILED"</font>

360
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,097
As if I were imagining
things, Yeon contacted me.

361
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,367
The end.

362
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,407
Yes?

363
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:58,937
Ji A, hurry downstairs.

364
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:00,976
- Why?
- Come on. It's urgent.

365
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:06,976
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

366
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,446
Happy birthday, my daughter.

367
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:10,847
Was it my birthday today?

368
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:12,687
I had completely forgotten.

369
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,256
Happy birthday.

370
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:22,157
Here's my gift.

371
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,096
- It's handmade.
- Gosh, it's so pretty.

372
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:27,036
- It looks great on you.
- I love it.

373
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,397
Mine was made in a factory.

374
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,367
Thanks, Mom.

375
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,907
Did you know that my watch
strap had fallen off?

376
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:37,907
- I saw it.
- How attentive of you.

377
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:39,377
Anyway, thank you.

378
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:41,976
Who sent that one?

379
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:44,716
You should open it.

380
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,567
On my birthday...

381
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:03,567
What would you like as a gift?

382
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:08,077
Something I've never
had before in my life.

383
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,746
Like a marriage proposal.

384
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:15,476
Sure. I'll make that happen.

385
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:18,587
It's from Yeon, right?

386
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,587
Did he come by?

387
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:22,857
A courier dropped it by.

388
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,187
It also came with a letter.

389
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,837
It was back when things
were tough for me.

390
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,306
I talked to my teammates and
tried to resolve the matter.

391
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:47,347
They suggested that we go out...

392
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,546
and helped me have a good time.

393
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:52,687
Becoming a member
of this team...

394
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,187
What did I say about
snacking on the couch?

395
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,327
I want my meal.

396
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,996
At least catch the
crumbs with a tray or...

397
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:01,627
Move. You're blocking the TV.

398
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,397
It was definitely hard for me.

399
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,766
Honey,

400
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,236
I told you to put your dirty
socks in the laundry basket,

401
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:10,306
I forgot.

402
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:13,177
Oh, wait. The other
one's over here.

403
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:19,476
How is it that only Soo Ho
cleans up after himself?

404
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:23,187
While singing and
dancing on stage...

405
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,056
The soup is a
little salty today.

406
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:39,167
Mr. Lee, until when
will you live with us?

407
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:41,466
Are you kidding me?

408
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,367
The three of us come as a set.

409
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:47,806
I'm good with it all,
but why must I suffer...

410
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,706
in my own home?

411
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,506
I ordered a new kimchi fridge.

412
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,046
Really? The model we saw
at the department store?

413
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,956
Mr. Lee bought it for us. It'll
be delivered this afternoon.

414
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:03,286
- I love you, Rang!
- Rang?

415
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:06,127
I'll call you that
from now on, Rang.

416
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:07,657
I love it.

417
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:10,597
We're like one big family
now. Don't you think?

418
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,105
<font color="#00ff00">TO MY BELOVED JI A</font>

419
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,306
Do you like your gift?

420
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:54,637
I hope you do.

421
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:02,716
How stunning would
you be in this dress?

422
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:06,887
I wonder...

423
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,226
who'd get to stand beside you.

424
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:14,656
Whoever it is,

425
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,967
I wish it's someone decent.

426
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,797
If only I could actually
be that nonchalant.

427
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:23,937
But truth be told,

428
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,877
I already hate the guts of
this future husband of yours.

429
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:34,246
I liked you.

430
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:39,286
I liked how you
viewed the world.

431
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:42,656
Despite being born
with a terrible fate,

432
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,897
you never easily lost hope.

433
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,096
Drinking coffee with you,

434
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,697
watching you sleep,

435
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,366
all the paths we
walked together,

436
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:01,076
and even the time I
spent waiting for you.

437
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,176
I loved them all.

438
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,447
Ji A,

439
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:12,447
whenever I called your name...

440
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:15,656
that rolled easily
off my tongue,

441
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:18,627
butterflies filled my stomach.

442
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:22,456
You'll now...

443
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:25,366
have to walk those
paths without me,

444
00:35:26,496 --> 00:35:27,996
but you'll get used to it.

445
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:30,766
You'll do well.

446
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:34,607
So please...

447
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:37,906
let me go now.

448
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:40,317
You must.

449
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,087
No.

450
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:46,456
I can't let you go.

451
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,167
Please come back to me.

452
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,036
I miss you so much.

453
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:26,326
Mister,

454
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,627
are you off to find the
nine-tailed fox again?

455
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,996
What did I tell you
about mentioning him?

456
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:33,366
Has there been any news?

457
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:37,107
I've been beating non-humans...

458
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,837
to see if they know anything
about how to bring him back.

459
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,877
- I'll give you a ride.
- Save it. It's cold outside anyway.

460
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:45,947
Hurry on home then.

461
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,777
The four of us will grill
pork belly for dinner.

462
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,417
Be safe on the road!

463
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:12,706
The key ring.

464
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:33,127
What brings you here?

465
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,266
What about you?

466
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:46,076
Rumors led me here
to that geezer.

467
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:55,165
<font color="#00ff00">FORTUNE-TELLING, PHYSIOGNOMY,
NAMING, COMPATIBILITY</font>

468
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,378
Are you really...

469
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,219
one of the afterlife judges?

470
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,389
I am the king of darkness.

471
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:16,358
I am the 10th king who rules
the Underworld of Darkness.

472
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:19,188
And I am also...

473
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,329
the very last judge.

474
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,409
I get to choose what happens
to you after you die.

475
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:34,038
You'd better sit up straight.

476
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:41,219
By any chance, if you have
the power to decide...

477
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,918
what happens to
us after we die...

478
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,188
Yes, that's right. I'm in
charge of reincarnation.

479
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:46,918
"Reincarnation"?

480
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,529
Then are you here
because of Yeon?

481
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:52,898
Well, I can't say
that's the only reason.

482
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,599
But I have something
that belongs to him.

483
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,538
You have the fox bead.
Give me the fox bead.

484
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:03,338
The fox bead.

485
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,009
Can this bring him back to life?

486
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,239
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

487
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:10,909
King Hades' sister, the
gatekeeper of the Samdo River,

488
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,978
kept calling the afterlife
judges, so that's why I'm here.

489
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,188
but we don't do charity work.

490
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:21,518
You both know the rules, right?

491
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:26,458
We need to give you the one thing
that's most precious to us, right?

492
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,498
I'll do it. I can do it.

493
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,768
As long as Yeon
comes back to life.

494
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,639
But what if you're not
able to meet him...

495
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,898
even if he comes back?

496
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:40,139
- What?
- People get reincarnated randomly.

497
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,279
It means you could cross paths.

498
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,878
He could get reincarnated
after you both die.

499
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:47,748
And he might be born with
a different appearance.

500
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,318
I don't care.

501
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,628
Let's start the deal.

502
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,029
Okay then.

503
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:10,438
Go ahead and bring me
something enticing...

504
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,338
before the sandglass stops.

505
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,529
- What's the matter?
- The king of darkness is here.

506
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:38,668
No wonder something felt
unusual. He's finally here.

507
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:53,148
That's a crow crying.

508
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:01,318
It cried three times.

509
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,788
I see people in
mourning clothes.

510
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,699
It looks like there
will be another death.

511
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:16,139
I'll do it.

512
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,168
Tell me what you can give me.

513
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,409
The person I cherish
the most is Yeon.

514
00:41:23,878 --> 00:41:27,318
But he's no longer here,
and my memories of him...

515
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:28,949
are all I have left.

516
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,119
I will sell you my memories.

517
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,318
I don't buy memories.

518
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,489
Forget that.

519
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:40,998
You have something else
that you received from him.

520
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,829
I'll give you anything.
Just tell me what you want.

521
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,668
For example,

522
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:47,898
the rest of your life.

523
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,579
If I give you my life,

524
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,318
- can Yeon get reincarnated?
- Hey.

525
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,918
If you want his life,
you can sacrifice yours.

526
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:09,088
There's no question about that.

527
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,168
I'll give it to you.

528
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:25,739
Hey, do you think Yeon saved
you just so you could...

529
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:26,978
cast away your life like that?

530
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,748
He didn't die for nothing,
you know. You're so pathetic.

531
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,818
Then will you give me your life?

532
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,799
Sure. I stole
people's lives anyway,

533
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,458
- so I have no regrets.
- Hey.

534
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:52,228
- Stay out of it.
- But...

535
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,438
if I remember correctly,
you had no will to live.

536
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,139
That makes your life worthless.

537
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:01,009
First, let's take a look
and check your worth.

538
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:17,759
Interesting.

539
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:22,659
It looks like you've
got yourself a family.

540
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:26,029
Now you're cherishing your life.

541
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:31,869
You pass.

542
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:33,938
We have a deal.

543
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,878
Deal.

544
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:38,409
- No!
- Wait.

545
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:43,248
We still have time.

546
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,119
Can you call the guys?

547
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,329
At least let me say goodbye.

548
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:11,849
This way.

549
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,409
Mr. Lee!

550
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:43,909
Mr. Lee!

551
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:46,679
Mr. Lee!

552
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,358
Oh, my gosh.

553
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:11,799
Oh, my goodness.

554
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:43,159
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

555
00:46:59,378 --> 00:47:06,248
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

556
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:44,349
<font color="#00ff00">HERE LIES LEE RANG</font>

557
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:58,368
- Ms. Nam.
- Yes?

558
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,498
Take this.

559
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,179
Where did you get this?

560
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,549
I'm not sure. Someone
dropped it off...

561
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:11,609
to give it to you.

562
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:13,918
- When?
- It was before my shift,

563
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:15,449
so about five minutes ago?

564
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:26,799
But...

565
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,159
Yeon.

566
00:49:58,188 --> 00:49:59,328
I'm sorry.

567
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,688
I told you not to
walk in the rain.

568
00:50:58,819 --> 00:50:59,918
Yeon.

569
00:51:02,288 --> 00:51:03,418
Is it really you?

570
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:08,299
You're not in disguise.
Isn't it a dream?

571
00:51:09,598 --> 00:51:10,799
It's really you?

572
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:16,299
Then why are you standing there?

573
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:19,409
Why won't you come to me?

574
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:22,739
I'm not the same
person I used to be.

575
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:25,478
What do you mean?

576
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:26,918
I can't even fly.

577
00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:32,489
Even if you fall from a high
place, I can't catch you.

578
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:37,029
Even if your path is dark,
I can't send fireflies.

579
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,759
It hurts if I get hit.

580
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,199
I get wounded if I get stabbed.

581
00:51:47,868 --> 00:51:50,538
There's nothing
I can do for you.

582
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:09,819
It doesn't matter.

583
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:12,359
I don't need any of that.

584
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,498
I've become human.

585
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:22,868
Human?

586
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,109
You're in trouble now.

587
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:34,149
I won't let you go
until the day you die.

588
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,089
I've missed you so much.

589
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:47,029
So much, that I thought I
was going to lose my mind.

590
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,629
I was terrified that
I'd never see you again.

591
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:16,918
How did you do it?

592
00:53:18,058 --> 00:53:19,159
What?

593
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:23,598
6 months felt like
6 years for me.

594
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:26,228
How did you wait for 600 years?

595
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,368
Do you develop a skill...

596
00:53:29,368 --> 00:53:31,868
and get used to it if
you wait long enough?

597
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,478
I didn't get used to waiting.

598
00:53:36,138 --> 00:53:39,409
I just couldn't get used
to being apart from you.

599
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,458
I wanted to be strong
like you as I waited,

600
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:50,688
but little things held me
back and knocked me over.

601
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:53,958
Like what? What
tormented you so much?

602
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,399
For example,

603
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:00,839
the night air from one night
when you walked me home.

604
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,768
The alarm from our rice cooker.

605
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:09,409
Remembering how warm your hands
were when we went for a walk.

606
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:12,308
Those little memories.

607
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,248
That's why...

608
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:18,449
you found me this time.

609
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:21,558
You found me.

610
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,498
These are real human hands now.

611
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,199
Yes. And a human body.

612
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,839
And human lips.

613
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:03,129
No. He isn't going
to sing there, is he?

614
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,799
- No...
- When I look at you like you

615
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:10,868
I want to kiss you

616
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:15,109
When I'm alone
with you like this

617
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:19,409
Sir, can you say a
few words to Yeon?

618
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,719
Yeon, my wife
finally quit smoking.

619
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,288
80 percent of it
is thanks to you.

620
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:26,788
Ma'am, what about you?

621
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:30,219
When I fell in love
with a human farmer,

622
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,759
you were the only
one who supported me.

623
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:35,259
You said you once
loved a mortal too.

624
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:38,368
Now, that same woman
is staying strong...

625
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,029
as she waits for you.

626
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:43,098
I hope you two can
finally meet one day...

627
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:44,208
You should try this too.

628
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,239
I want fish too. Fish.

629
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:49,879
- I'll bring you some more.
- I'll get it.

630
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,308
Let's eat baeksuk
after our walk.

631
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:21,379
Are you happy?

632
00:56:26,578 --> 00:56:28,649
<font color="#00ff00">SHUNJU ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

633
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:35,319
Mr. Lee!

634
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,859
Mr. Lee!

635
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:39,259
Mr. Lee!

636
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,739
How's the apartment? Livable?

637
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:56,409
You don't know the half of
it. They provide everything.

638
00:56:56,409 --> 00:56:57,748
A sauna, a gym...

639
00:56:57,909 --> 00:57:00,109
It's definitely worth more
than its current price.

640
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:01,578
There are even two
railway stations close by.

641
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:04,149
You're quite
materialistic for a fox.

642
00:57:04,649 --> 00:57:06,918
I'm the manager of the
resident association.

643
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:10,728
So were you able...

644
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,788
to cherish me more
during my absence?

645
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:16,299
I've been enjoying being
a newlywed to miss you.

646
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:18,429
Then I'm leaving.

647
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:20,938
Just kidding.

648
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:25,409
Being human comes with mood swings,
so be careful with what you say.

649
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:28,208
This is the first time I
feel inferior to anyone.

650
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:31,379
Saying that with your face will
earn you a smack on the head.

651
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,949
Anyway, I'm glad you're back.

652
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:41,118
In our own ways, we've been
coping with your death...

653
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:42,418
while awaiting your return.

654
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,429
Sometimes, we whined and
leaned on each other.

655
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,699
And Rang?

656
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:02,708
He was a total wreck
from the day you left.

657
00:58:03,879 --> 00:58:05,649
He cried all night for a month.

658
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,418
Things got better after
he moved in with us,

659
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:10,179
but he kept searching for you.

660
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:15,558
Were you with him
at his final moment?

661
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,998
He would've been so scared.

662
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,779
Despite what people think,
he gets scared easily.

663
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:42,379
Here's his phone.

664
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:44,489
Take a look.

665
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:25,489
It's me.

666
00:59:26,728 --> 00:59:27,828
I'll be dead soon.

667
00:59:30,728 --> 00:59:34,339
If you were here, you'd
come to rescue me.

668
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,038
Since you can't,
I'm totally doomed.

669
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:42,509
Anyway, this is payback...

670
00:59:42,638 --> 00:59:44,509
for your final message to me.

671
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:49,418
I thought it'd feel
different to face death,

672
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:54,089
but maybe you're right
about me easily giving up.

673
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:56,788
I'm sad but relieved in a way.

674
00:59:58,558 --> 00:59:59,828
So...

675
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:03,659
don't you be a fool
and cry over my death.

676
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,739
I never once cried
in your absence.

677
01:00:09,098 --> 01:00:10,768
All I did was get drunk.

678
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:12,038
You liar.

679
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,808
I've been causing you
trouble for years,

680
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,819
but I won't apologize since
you're the bigger jerk.

681
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:28,259
Whenever we split a fruit, you
always gave me the bigger piece.

682
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,429
Despite your
obsession with eggs,

683
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,429
you always let me have yours.

684
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:41,168
So how could I not hate you for
choosing the girl over me...

685
01:00:41,168 --> 01:00:42,768
after I've grown
accustomed to you?

686
01:00:47,368 --> 01:00:49,509
I'm going to be reborn
as a humpback shrimp,

687
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:51,949
so don't eat them just in case.

688
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,328
I hope...

689
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,529
you'll be reincarnated too.

690
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:23,009
Preferably with an ugly face.

691
01:01:29,248 --> 01:01:30,418
Still...

692
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:33,719
Still,

693
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:36,659
if we can,

694
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:40,788
let's meet again.

695
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,768
My brother.

696
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:10,288
My brother...

697
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:29,308
Kim Soo Ho, you don't
have parents, do you?

698
01:02:29,739 --> 01:02:31,279
I heard that your mom ran away.

699
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:32,808
No, she didn't.

700
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:34,478
He lives in a shabby house too.

701
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:36,879
I saw it when we were
in the same class.

702
01:02:37,649 --> 01:02:41,117
- You're a homeless beggar
- You're a homeless beggar

703
01:02:41,118 --> 01:02:42,988
- You're a homeless beggar
- You're a homeless beggar

704
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,288
- You're a homeless beggar
- Soo Ho!

705
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:49,359
Let's go home.

706
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:52,429
And we're not beggars.

707
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:56,168
Come on.

708
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,308
Wasn't that perfect timing?

709
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:07,748
Rang unexpectedly
did good deeds,

710
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:11,788
and it was passed
down unexpectedly.

711
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:23,899
Still, in a slightly
uncanny way,

712
01:03:25,098 --> 01:03:26,629
love is passed on.

713
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:01,569
My hands fit right
on your shoulders.

714
01:04:04,609 --> 01:04:05,668
Yeon!

715
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:18,819
I missed you, Granny.

716
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:21,518
Don't be a drama
queen. It's tacky.

717
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:23,618
I heard you pulled some
strings to get me out.

718
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:25,328
Me?

719
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:28,859
She made at least 200 calls.

720
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,399
Her brother ended up
blocking her number.

721
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,038
You couldn't live
without me, right?

722
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:38,438
Shove off.

723
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,808
I will soon, anyway.

724
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,248
This will be the last
day you see my face.

725
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:47,679
How so?

726
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:50,418
I can't be back here now
that I've become human.

727
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:52,949
I should live among them.

728
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:56,688
You'll only see him
once he's dead now.

729
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:59,228
Why would you say that
and jinx his life?

730
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,659
Don't you know how hard
it was to get him back?

731
01:05:02,228 --> 01:05:05,899
Thank you for adoring
a troublemaker like me.

732
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:10,168
You kept me busy
until Ji A returned...

733
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,268
so that I wouldn't lose my mind.

734
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:17,379
Because of you and Hyeonuiong,

735
01:05:18,909 --> 01:05:20,109
I've made it this far.

736
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:23,679
Have a good life, Yeon.
Living as a mortal...

737
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:26,118
isn't as easy as it sounds,

738
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:28,288
but I'm sure you'll
do a good job.

739
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:30,288
Sure.

740
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:34,058
I wish you both live a
long and healthy life.

741
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:37,899
I'll get going then.

742
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:43,668
Hey!

743
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:50,208
Since you're here, stuff
yourself with some tteokbokki.

744
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:53,909
Am I supposed to
get some for you?

745
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,779
- Must you ask?
- Right.

746
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,659
Darn, it's spicy.

747
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:07,288
How is this spicy? Unbelievable.

748
01:06:07,288 --> 01:06:09,498
I got medium level spiciness,
but it's still very spicy to me.

749
01:06:10,228 --> 01:06:11,328
Sundae is good.

750
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:14,668
Like she has always been,
Granny is still a workaholic.

751
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:15,699
I like the fish cake.

752
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:18,339
- Only one thing changed.
- The fish cake is to die for.

753
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:22,308
Now, the married couple
sometimes stay up all night...

754
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:24,239
talking about
their deceased son.

755
01:06:25,808 --> 01:06:28,649
Also, tteokbokki with a
medium level of spiciness...

756
01:06:29,348 --> 01:06:31,188
is said to be somewhat
enjoyable too.

757
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,759
Gosh, it's spicy.

758
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:10,412
Well, I don't know...

759
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:12,923
if love really lasts forever.

760
01:07:13,982 --> 01:07:17,423
But you like drumsticks,
and I like chicken breasts.

761
01:07:18,692 --> 01:07:21,562
You like egg yolks,
and I like egg whites.

762
01:07:21,963 --> 01:07:25,133
Therefore, that makes
us the perfect couple.

763
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:28,103
You're probably the first
woman who confesses love...

764
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,933
with chicken and eggs.

765
01:07:34,612 --> 01:07:37,513
We're finally getting married.

766
01:07:40,412 --> 01:07:42,952
And you've finally become human.

767
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:48,723
The Korean word "human"
is very interesting to me.

768
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:53,622
If you carve away the corners
of the final consonant,

769
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:55,463
that word turns into "love".

770
01:07:57,963 --> 01:07:59,103
You see,

771
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:02,633
I don't have the
best personality,

772
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:05,103
and I'm not sure if
I'll do a good job...

773
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:08,572
of living as a human being,

774
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:13,112
but I know I will love
you more than anything.

775
01:08:21,122 --> 01:08:22,223
I love you.

776
01:08:22,652 --> 01:08:23,793
I love you too.

777
01:08:45,213 --> 01:08:48,452
What? What's with the
raining flowers in fall?

778
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,683
They're congratulating him.

779
01:08:52,652 --> 01:08:55,093
The flowers, trees, and wind...

780
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:57,522
are saying goodbye...

781
01:08:58,562 --> 01:08:59,923
to their beloved master.

782
01:09:01,963 --> 01:09:04,362
They're thanking him for how
much he took care of them.

783
01:10:05,093 --> 01:10:07,862
And the extremely handsome
nine tailed fox...

784
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:09,763
lived happily ever after.

785
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:12,603
Hey, stop narrating
it your own way.

786
01:10:13,562 --> 01:10:16,202
I'm married to a director,
so I only state facts.

787
01:10:17,032 --> 01:10:18,772
- Turn it around.
- Okay.

788
01:10:32,652 --> 01:10:33,952
Should we have a baby?

789
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:42,862
I'd love to.

790
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:45,263
But there's something
that worries me.

791
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:46,963
What is it?

792
01:10:47,562 --> 01:10:49,333
What if our daughter thinks
I'm an embarrassment...

793
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,072
for not having
graduated college?

794
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:58,213
Then we can tell her you did
something even more amazing.

795
01:11:01,452 --> 01:11:04,982
- And what's that?
- That you saved my life...

796
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:06,923
and the entire world,

797
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:08,522
although no one really
knows that part.

798
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:10,923
Well, it's the truth.

799
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:15,933
But who says we're going
to have a daughter?

800
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:19,162
- Did I say "daughter"?
- Yes.

801
01:11:19,963 --> 01:11:21,402
That's weird. That can't be.

802
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,732
<font color="#00ff00">SHIN JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL</font>

803
01:11:28,812 --> 01:11:31,343
Be honest with me. How
does it feel to be human?

804
01:11:31,482 --> 01:11:32,742
Is it better than being a fox?

805
01:11:32,742 --> 01:11:36,213
I thought it'd be really
nice, but I was wrong.

806
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:38,152
How should I say this?

807
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,982
There are so many variables.

808
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,192
"Variables"?

809
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:50,362
Apparently, I have astigmatism.
And it's different in each eye.

810
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:52,933
Look.

811
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:56,372
This makes me look...

812
01:11:57,303 --> 01:11:59,503
a lot less handsome in no time.

813
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:07,343
If you compare the
two of us right now,

814
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:09,713
I think I look a
bit more handsome.

815
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:12,022
- That's not true.
- You're right.

816
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:17,753
And that's not the only problem.

817
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:23,333
Did you lie to me?

818
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:25,503
You told me we're
going to eat ice cream.

819
01:12:25,503 --> 01:12:26,963
I didn't lie to
you. I told you...

820
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:28,433
we need to go somewhere
before we eat.

821
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:32,242
I'd rather get
stabbed by a knife.

822
01:12:32,242 --> 01:12:33,803
I really can't
stand anesthetics.

823
01:12:34,473 --> 01:12:36,242
- Be a good boy.
- Let me go.

824
01:12:37,013 --> 01:12:38,312
How can your love
change like this?

825
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,282
What are you talking about?

826
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:45,383
Root canal treatment was
literally the worst thing ever.

827
01:12:46,723 --> 01:12:48,192
Living as a human
being is about...

828
01:12:48,522 --> 01:12:50,423
fighting against
unexpected kinds of pain.

829
01:12:51,152 --> 01:12:52,562
Ta-da.

830
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:58,963
What do you think? Is it good?

831
01:12:58,963 --> 01:13:01,303
You cook the best instant
noodles in this entire world.

832
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:04,133
Honey, do we have soju?

833
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:05,902
Of course.

834
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,442
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

835
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,112
You worked so hard today.

836
01:13:15,112 --> 01:13:16,482
You did too.

837
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:19,853
Instant noodles and soju. This is
what's so nice about being human.

838
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:16,213
The next time you fall,

839
01:14:16,812 --> 01:14:18,713
try to get back up
on your own, okay?

840
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,112
Here.

841
01:14:24,952 --> 01:14:26,423
Thank you.

842
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:50,742
- Did you fall?
- Yes.

843
01:14:50,942 --> 01:14:52,883
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

844
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:54,612
You should've been more careful.

845
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:56,412
Does it not hurt?

846
01:14:56,412 --> 01:14:58,553
No, this man helped me get up.

847
01:15:01,692 --> 01:15:03,622
He didn't get to be reborn
as a humpback shrimp.

848
01:15:23,643 --> 01:15:24,912
How was your day?

849
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:26,713
It was the same old.

850
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:31,952
I saw someone strange at
the police station today.

851
01:15:32,482 --> 01:15:33,522
Why did that person
look strange?

852
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,393
He was an old man
wearing a Hahoe mask.

853
01:15:35,793 --> 01:15:37,723
But that mask wouldn't
come off his face.

854
01:15:37,853 --> 01:15:39,793
It was as if it was stuck there.

855
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:40,862
A Hahoe mask?

856
01:15:42,192 --> 01:15:44,893
By any chance, did you
step on bird poop today?

857
01:15:46,362 --> 01:15:48,103
No, not bird poop.

858
01:15:48,872 --> 01:15:50,173
I did step on gum though.

859
01:15:50,503 --> 01:15:51,843
Darn it.

860
01:15:51,942 --> 01:15:52,973
Why?

861
01:15:53,103 --> 01:15:55,213
He's a spirit of misfortune.

862
01:15:55,543 --> 01:15:56,713
Misfortune?

863
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:59,343
<font color="#00ff00">MISFORTUNE THAT COMES TO HUMANS

864
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:06,553
There may be entities
that we are unaware of...

865
01:16:06,652 --> 01:16:09,223
cohabitating in
this world with us.

866
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:12,763
Perhaps those countless urban
legends that circulate...

867
01:16:13,263 --> 01:16:15,232
are just stories about them.

868
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:18,862
I've overheard the secrets...

869
01:16:19,263 --> 01:16:20,732
of the world.

870
01:16:35,043 --> 01:16:36,652
Living as a human being means...

871
01:16:37,482 --> 01:16:40,952
that life is full of firsts...

872
01:16:41,353 --> 01:16:42,793
and lasts.

873
01:16:43,893 --> 01:16:46,692
First snowfall. First step.

874
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:48,732
First picnic.

875
01:16:50,032 --> 01:16:51,562
First root canal.

876
01:16:56,933 --> 01:16:57,973
And...

877
01:16:59,173 --> 01:17:00,173
Forever...

878
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:02,473
my first love.

879
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:13,143
Hey, you.

880
01:18:23,293 --> 01:18:24,423
Are you the spirit
of misfortune?

881
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:06,793
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>
