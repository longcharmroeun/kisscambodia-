00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,259
No, she must not see it.

8
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:05,259
Put them on, and look at
yourself in the mirror.

9
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,959
It'll give you the
answer to your question.

10
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,689
Rain is much needed at times.

11
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,559
For nature, for farmers,

12
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,288
and also for us.

13
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,098
Why are you looking
at me that way?

14
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,768
It seems like our time passes...

15
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,408
at a different speed.

16
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,318
You haven't changed since
that first time we met.

17
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:42,958
Does it scare you?

18
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,859
The life and death
of a mortal, I mean.

19
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,699
It does.

20
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,669
I'm not afraid of growing
old, falling sick, or dying.

21
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,009
But I do worry about...

22
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,708
how you'll be able to
manage the long years...

23
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,238
without me by your side.

24
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,729
As much as I want to stop
time, it never happens.

25
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,148
There we go. I stopped time.

26
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,778
I'll have a good life
even without you.

27
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,419
That's cold.

28
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:18,549
If that's how you feel,

29
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,518
you should lay down your
bow and focus on longevity.

30
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,159
Grow old with gray hair
and a bent spine...

31
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,759
and make me fall out of love.

32
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:29,299
Promise me that won't change
how you will feel about me.

33
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,898
If I ever betray you...

34
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:35,468
Then what?

35
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,238
Drive an arrow through me.

36
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,359
Ma'am!

37
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,029
I mean, my lady.

38
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,928
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

39
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,269
Must I report using
the privy too?

40
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:06,498
Goodness me.

41
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,308
There's a message from the
palace. You have been summoned.

42
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,138
- What?
- You should change first...

43
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,178
Who dares to summon...

44
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,609
the daughter of the King who
was expelled from the palace?

45
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,678
It was the King.

46
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:26,758
The King, you say?

47
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,419
There's no time to chit-chat.

48
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,988
The Majesty is in
critical condition.

49
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,558
You're a big girl now.

50
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,399
And you've grown weak.

51
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,399
How has life been
outside the palace walls?

52
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,738
My eyes have been stinging.

53
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,308
Your eyes...

54
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:19,909
have been stinging?

55
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,909
Because of the smoke
on the streets.

56
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,279
At first, I thought it
came from cooking rice.

57
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:30,149
But that wasn't the case.

58
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:33,258
It came from burning the bodies
that had starved to death.

59
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,859
It's your people, Father.

60
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,359
The country is...

61
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,299
in an unstable set.

62
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,068
That's what I thought at first,

63
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,669
but it wasn't the case.

64
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,409
It's the King's mind
that is unstable.

65
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,479
Because something evil...

66
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,748
has taken control over it.

67
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:13,828
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

68
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,599
You must be Imoogi.

69
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:21,238
Back then and even now,
you're the only person...

70
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,868
who sees me for who I am.

71
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,049
Get out.

72
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:34,078
I said, leave his body.

73
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,089
Go on. Why not scream and alert
the others like last time?

74
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,599
Shoot away. His body is
almost destroyed anyway.

75
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:54,969
It wouldn't be so bad...

76
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:56,969
to have the foolish father...

77
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,839
die at the hands of
the daughter he saved.

78
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,238
Enough with the tricks!

79
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,149
Why do you think you got
kicked out of the palace?

80
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:06,878
That's because...

81
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,519
you took over my
father's body...

82
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:13,659
and manipulated him...

83
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,459
Your father chose
that path for himself!

84
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,488
What?

85
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,029
You were born...

86
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,998
to be offered to
me as a sacrifice.

87
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:24,969
Your father...

88
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:28,568
willingly gave up this
body of his to save you.

89
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,448
Bring me the mountain spirit.

90
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,618
Then I will let
go of your father.

91
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,688
If I stay in his body,
he will be dead...

92
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,859
within three days.

93
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:13,878
Fine.

94
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,789
I will bring Yeon to you.

95
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
However,

96
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,228
a mountain spirit
belongs in the mountain.

97
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,598
He cannot leave the
place he protects.

98
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,299
- What?
- Let my father go,

99
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,639
and come with me.

100
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:40,009
You may...

101
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,409
take my body.

102
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,019
First, let's get him
out of the palace.

103
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,228
Then let's trust in Yeon
to take care of the rest.

104
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,578
She means nothing to me.

105
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,848
- I do not believe you.
- You think you used her as bait.

106
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,049
But don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

107
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,328
Don't kill me!

108
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,669
I don't want to die.

109
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,509
You promised me.

110
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,779
You promised to love
me until the day I die.

111
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,678
- Yeon.
- Show yourself!

112
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,799
Did you see it?

113
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,808
Tell me. Did you see it?

114
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,848
Please look at me.

115
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,088
What did you see?

116
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,858
I was...

117
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,228
murdered in my past life.

118
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,068
You...

119
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,338
killed me.

120
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,879
Your sole purpose was
to find the Imoogi.

121
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:08,779
Yeon.

122
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:14,318
You used me...

123
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,328
to offer as a sacrifice.

124
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,058
Was that...

125
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,129
really you?

126
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:30,739
Yes, it was me.

127
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,509
You were the one
who always saved me?

128
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,549
And I was your first
love whom you've kept...

129
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,049
in your heart for
hundreds of years?

130
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:41,318
Yes.

131
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,549
I killed you.

132
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,728
I killed you with
my own two hands.

133
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:55,228
Why?

134
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:01,399
You don't want to see
the tragedy on replay.

135
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:02,968
Either one of you...

136
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,108
must die in the end.

137
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:16,818
I'm just that kind of person.

138
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,119
That's all you have to say?

139
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,928
You swayed me and
made me fall for you,

140
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,358
and that's all you have to say?

141
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:32,198
At least give me an excuse!

142
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,769
Please.

143
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,678
I had a lot more to gain.

144
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,519
I took your life to save
hundreds of other lives.

145
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,188
After all, I'm a
mountain spirit.

146
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,399
I don't understand...

147
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,369
why my heart aches so much.

148
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,799
Why did I worry about you even
until the moment you killed me?

149
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,869
And why am I still crying...

150
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:14,678
because of you?

151
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,119
Don't be mistaken.

152
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,919
They're not your emotions.

153
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,058
Don't act like
you're that woman...

154
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,958
just because you got to see a
small part of your past life.

155
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,029
You jerk.

156
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:42,169
Yes, I'm a jerk. So don't waste
your emotions on a guy like me.

157
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,769
Make sure you don't make the
same mistake in this life.

158
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:50,078
That way, you'll get
to live a long life.

159
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:14,098
Your rice is cooked.

00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:58,678
Don't give him alcohol.

166
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,919
It looks like there's going
to be trouble tonight.

167
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,458
Did she see it?

168
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,299
I guess she saw her past
life. What did she say?

169
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:25,438
Will you please tell me? I
won't be able to sleep tonight.

170
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,739
Rang.

171
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:30,448
Yes?

172
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,948
What do you want to be
born as in your next life?

173
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,289
What an absurd question.

174
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,289
Tell me.

175
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,259
I don't really care.

176
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,259
If I must choose, a Dokdo
shrimp would be nice.

177
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,098
I like the whiskers on them.

178
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:51,668
And they're worth
a lot of money.

179
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,539
If I ever get to be born again,
I want to live as a human being.

180
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,679
What a pathetic wish.

181
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:06,348
I want my life to be filled
with firsts and lasts.

182
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,789
My first step. My first picnic.

183
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,519
My first love.

184
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,489
Why are you being such a loser?

185
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,259
It has been so long since
we chatted openly like this.

186
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,558
Do you feel sick?

187
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,469
Did you completely snap
after fighting with her?

188
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:26,668
Imoogi.

189
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:30,868
Where is he?

190
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,338
Do you think I'd tell you?

191
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,009
I expected as much.

192
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,509
So that's what you choose.

193
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,800
<font color="#00ff00">WE ARE PREPARING TO SERVE YOU.</font>

194
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:02,999
How about a game?

195
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,269
We used to play often before.

196
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,408
It's no fun playing you.

197
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,249
You've never once beaten me.

198
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,388
Are you going to play or not?

199
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,269
Got you.

200
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,068
Yeon, why is the sky blue?

201
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:40,279
I don't know. I
didn't dye it myself.

202
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:44,078
When why do owls
go, "hoot hoot"?

203
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,479
I don't know. I
didn't make them hoot.

204
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:49,378
Why does this
flower taste sweet?

205
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,618
Why do flowers bloom
only in the spring?

206
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,749
Quiet.

207
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,418
Why did you hit me?

208
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,318
Why does a pip-squeak
have so many questions?

209
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,158
I just like hearing your voice.

210
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,729
You're too rash.

211
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,439
I told you to cut off the tail.

212
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,668
I told you not to leave
blank spaces for no reason.

213
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:48,539
I won!

214
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:50,949
I won again!

215
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:53,179
I'm angry.

216
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,019
Not bad, kid.

217
00:20:58,318 --> 00:20:59,719
I'm not a kid.

218
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,469
Running like that won't work.

219
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,439
It worked! Yes!

220
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,848
It's hard raising a kid.

221
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,058
You're too slow. Again.

222
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:44,868
You think it's strange
too, don't you?

223
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:49,068
How did you win every single
time with skills like this?

224
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,108
Shut it.

225
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,279
I let you win.

226
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,878
There was never an exception.

227
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:10,529
I said to shut it.

228
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,388
I don't plan to let
you win anymore.

229
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,668
This is what I wanted to say.

230
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:24,138
Hey, you. Stop right there.

231
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,939
If you leave now, it's
really over between us.

232
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,519
Sorry.

233
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:42,158
You're sorry?

234
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,759
Now? What are you sorry for?

235
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:46,658
For saving you...

236
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:49,729
when you were abandoned by
your human mom back then.

237
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:53,368
Then...

238
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:56,868
we never would've been brothers.

239
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,068
Mom?

240
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:34,838
Get away! Get off of me!

241
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:36,479
No!

242
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,229
Mom.

243
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,199
Mom.

244
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,229
Mom.

245
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:32,799
Are you that?

246
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,769
The thing that my
father had with a human?

247
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:38,769
Are you a fox too?

248
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:44,808
I came to see you because I
heard you had my father's blood,

249
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:46,479
but you're pathetic.

250
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,378
You have no will to live either.

251
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,189
I wasted my time. I'm leaving.

252
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,759
Look. He's still alive.

253
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,799
It's an evil spirit. It
doesn't die even if it dies.

254
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,898
The grudge of those who died
of starvation is incessant.

255
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,168
I prefer them over those
who give up easily.

256
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:13,408
Hey.

257
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:18,009
Live as a human or a
fox. That's up to you.

258
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:19,949
But remember this, kid.

259
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,818
There is no salvation to those
who won't save themselves.

260
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,469
Wait for me!

261
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,039
Wait for me, big brother.

262
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:50,868
I'll wait for you right here.

263
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:53,098
Here? All day?

264
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,039
When it comes to waiting, no
one can do it better than me.

265
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,368
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

266
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:07,378
Gosh, you'll even
outlive me too.

267
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:12,179
Would you like one? It
seems like you could use it.

268
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:14,179
I'll pass today.

269
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:18,888
A human's soul leaves a
stink every time you eat it.

270
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,519
Their memories invade your dreams
and disrupts your peace as well.

271
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:26,828
Still, I'm yet alive thanks
to sucking in their lives.

272
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:28,759
You too, Mr. Lee.

273
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,769
Why ground cherries though?
They give me the creeps.

274
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:35,999
I was told that they resemble
the human soul the most.

275
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:39,168
Is Imoogi home?

276
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,009
I'd like to see him.

277
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,348
Now's not a good time.

278
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:51,289
If he had all the dirty
work taken care of for him,

279
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,049
he should at least show his
gratitude and repay the favor.

280
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,118
If not, he's no different
from being a gold digger.

281
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:00,289
- I can relay the message.
- It's not what I want.

282
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:04,368
It's for your own sake. I
don't want to see you get hurt.

283
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,769
What?

284
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:13,469
Just because I let
you have your fun...

285
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:15,439
doesn't mean I'm a pushover.

286
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:21,179
You find this funny?

287
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,348
Please let him go.

288
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:46,969
Are you Imoogi?

289
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:50,108
It's good to meet you. I've
been waiting for this too.

290
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,441
What on earth?

291
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:01,641
You haven't answered
my calls or texts.

292
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:09,721
I have something to discuss. It's
about the dog you brought by.

293
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,621
My gosh. Did it die?

294
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,191
No, that's not it.

295
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:16,121
Well,

296
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:20,631
it doesn't have a name.

297
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:23,961
Just give it any random one.

298
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:26,572
No way. A name gives
them an identity.

299
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:29,171
Then carefully think
of one that will work.

300
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:32,211
You're its mother, so...

301
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:36,681
Its mom?

302
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:39,352
The mom...

303
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:42,421
Call it Anastasia.

304
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,522
"Anastasia"?

305
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:47,022
What a pretty name.

306
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,121
It suits even a male dog.

307
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:50,691
Of course, it does.

308
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,602
- Why are you gazing at me?
- No reason.

309
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,931
I'm glad to know that
I was right about you.

310
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:04,411
Gaze at me like that again...

311
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:06,612
and it'll be the
last thing you see.

312
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,381
I don't care how
your life has been.

313
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:16,181
For what purpose you
approached me doesn't matter.

314
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:18,191
I'll show you...

315
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,822
that the world is not all evil.

316
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:25,461
I'll make sure you
regret ever saying that.

317
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:27,332
I'll look forward to it.

318
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,161
What the...

319
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,171
I'll kill you!

320
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:35,371
See you around.

321
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:47,881
I thought you were
still a little boy.

322
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:50,121
You must've been
enjoying a feast.

323
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,022
Can you give us some room?

324
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:56,022
- Are you sure...
- We'll be fine.

325
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:05,471
Why so sad?

326
00:33:07,201 --> 00:33:10,441
- What?
- You've been gravely hurt.

327
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,812
Cut the nonsense.

328
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:13,772
Was it your brother?

329
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:19,651
I see it, you know.

330
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:22,352
You're being
tormented from within.

331
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:28,362
I did not expect you
to be this annoying.

332
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:29,992
Don't we seem alike?

333
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,792
I personally detest
those who shed skin.

334
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,201
You'd better listen.

335
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:41,201
Regardless of your goal, I
will operate at my own pace.

336
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:42,802
I can't wait any longer.

337
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,302
I see you want to kill her.

338
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:50,312
But no can do, I'm afraid.

339
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,081
Why's that?

340
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,481
Because she was originally
sacrificed to me.

341
00:33:57,892 --> 00:33:59,351
Thus, she will be my bride.

342
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,932
Congratulations
on your promotion

343
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:09,731
Thank you, thank you.

344
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:13,731
- Are you insane?
- Tell me about it.

345
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:17,271
Ji A, he's been promoted
to department chief.

346
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,912
As if he did anything to
deserve that promotion.

347
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:22,282
Just say you're jealous
since I know you are.

348
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:24,682
The higher-ups must
still not be aware...

349
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:26,711
of how you spend your hours
doing personal activities.

350
00:34:26,912 --> 00:34:29,052
Playing pool, working out,
singing at a karaoke...

351
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:32,921
Hey, I only went to sing once
on the day I got divorced.

352
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:35,061
- He sang "She's Gone".
- Hey!

353
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,862
Who wants cake?

354
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:50,101
You seem down today.

355
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:53,472
- It's nothing.
- As if.

356
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,412
I've known you for years now.

357
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:58,311
Did you and your
boyfriend argue?

358
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,351
Just make up with him.

359
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,751
If you don't, he'll be the
last man you'll ever date.

360
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,691
Wake up, Ji A.

361
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:09,092
Apart from being younger,
you're way out of his league.

362
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,561
That's not the case!

363
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:13,231
Why would you shake her
confidence like that?

364
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:15,231
But I'm right. It's the truth.

365
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,061
- Only we can dispirit her.
- Exactly.

366
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,101
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

367
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:26,612
This is what you get for
acting all high and mighty.

368
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:29,242
- So do you have a new story?
- Yes.

369
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:31,182
I just decided on one.

370
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:34,251
What is it?

371
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:35,851
Stories about past lives.

372
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:54,601
How about a hug?

373
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:57,702
- Get lost.
- I'm relieved.

374
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:00,242
I'm glad you're still yourself.

375
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,182
I made some tofu rice balls.

376
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,722
I bet you barely ate or slept.

377
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:12,751
I'm fine.

378
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,921
Just have one. The hint
of vinegar is to die for.

379
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,392
I'm not in
kindergarten, you know.

380
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:24,061
Look!

381
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,202
- Seriously?
- Go on and eat.

382
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,671
You need the energy
to protect and serve.

383
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:40,782
I'm curious though. Why
didn't you tell Ms. Nam?

384
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:44,722
She's mistaken and that
there's more to the story.

385
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,092
You could've told her that.

386
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:49,362
It's all starting again.

387
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,731
If history repeats itself,

388
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,901
that's more of a reason for me
to stay as the bad guy to her.

389
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,171
You're scared, aren't you?

390
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:09,642
You're scared she might
sacrifice herself to save you...

391
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,112
just like A Eum.

392
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:18,392
Are you sure you
won't regret it?

393
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:25,162
No.

394
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:28,131
But you're still going
to protect her from afar?

395
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:29,561
Yes.

396
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,032
Even after you spent all
those years waiting for her?

397
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,601
Yes.

398
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:34,872
Do you really mean it?

399
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:37,671
I've made up my mind.

400
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,322
Please keep a close eye on her.

401
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:55,461
The tofu rice ball
tastes delicious.

402
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,101
I'll go with you.

403
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:08,041
It's okay. I know the
doctor personally.

404
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:10,072
- What about lunch?
- You guys can eat without me.

405
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,791
Mister.

406
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:32,892
Mister.

407
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:36,762
Why are you ignoring me?

408
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:38,932
Because I don't
want to talk to you.

409
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,231
I've been waiting
for you all day.

410
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,472
Why would you wait for me?

411
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:48,481
I thought about what I
want to be in the future.

412
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:53,751
When I was six years old, I
wanted to be a Triceratops.

413
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:56,822
But when I turned seven,

414
00:38:57,182 --> 00:39:00,722
I thought it'd be cool to be
an owner of an internet cafe.

415
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:03,191
And when I turned eight...

416
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,631
Get to the point.

417
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:07,461
When I grow up, I
want to be like you.

418
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,731
You're handsome, brave,

419
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:12,331
and you have superpowers.

420
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:15,941
We're different in every aspect.

421
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,742
- How so?
- Because I hit people first.

422
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:24,242
Judging by your face, someone
must've beaten you up.

423
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:27,282
Did it happen in
school? Or your home?

424
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:29,722
I... I didn't get beaten up.

425
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,122
It's your choice whether
to beat people up...

426
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,351
or get beaten up instead.

427
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,722
But apparently, there
is no salvation...

428
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:40,791
to those who won't
save themselves.

429
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,682
I heard they're stepbrothers,

430
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:57,282
but I guess it's much more
complicated than that.

431
00:39:58,182 --> 00:39:59,581
I was touched...

432
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,021
by the wonderful smell
of his tainted soul.

433
00:40:06,892 --> 00:40:07,921
Why don't we test...

434
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:11,492
whether or not he'll become
another Achilles' heel to Yeon?

435
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,762
How?

436
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,662
We're expecting a guest.

437
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:24,242
My goodness. Let me help.

438
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:25,441
Hurry up and take it.

439
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:26,972
- Here.
- Thank you.

440
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

441
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:30,912
What do we have here?

442
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:35,552
This plum tea smells amazing.

443
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:38,651
We received organic
plums from Hadong.

444
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,592
"Hadong"? Goodness, no wonder.

445
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:44,191
I once went to the plum
festival in Hadong for work.

446
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:47,032
- And that was back in...
- Ma'am.

447
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,032
The petals were falling down.

448
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,432
And the scenery was...

449
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,501
I'll take you there one day.

450
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:57,271
I promise. Goodness.

451
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,481
What... What are you looking at?

452
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,881
You never went to the
plum festival for work.

453
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,222
What are you doing here?

454
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,862
I came to a restaurant to
eat. Why else would I be here?

455
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,331
Everyone knows what
a great cook you are.

456
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:21,561
You should leave.

457
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:25,702
I might as well give the
leftover rice to mice.

458
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:27,702
But there's no rice for you.

459
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:31,101
You little wench.

460
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:33,842
Have you lost your mind...

461
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:37,012
after having lived as a
widow for hundreds of years?

462
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:38,811
If that's not it,

463
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,622
have you forgotten who I am?

464
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:46,392
How could I ever forget you?

465
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,191
I lost my husband
because of you.

466
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:54,291
My goodness, you
are unbelievable.

467
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,262
Are you still not over
that foolish farmer?

468
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:02,001
Why did you do that to him?

469
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:05,372
Everyone lives with
a painful memory...

470
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,142
of their own.

471
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:12,711
I just reminded your husband
of his trauma like I always do.

472
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:15,351
But he was the one who chose
to live in that bubble.

473
00:42:15,722 --> 00:42:18,251
You should blame him for
being so mentally weak.

474
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,952
Why? Why did it have to be him?

475
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:23,521
To be more exact,

476
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:26,532
you should ask why
it had to be you.

477
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,432
What?

478
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:30,862
You see,

479
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,032
I really hate people like you.

480
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:36,941
The main characters of famous
traditional fairy tales.

481
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:41,441
Unlike you, no one
ever remembers my name.

482
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:46,081
Are you okay?

483
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:55,122
Do you need help?

484
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,592
- Don't let it bother you.
- How could I not let it bother me?

485
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:01,262
Listen, ma'am.

486
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:04,702
If you don't like it here,
just go eat somewhere else.

487
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:08,101
You could come out on the news
for being a rude customer.

488
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:12,372
What do you fear the most?

489
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:16,311
What?

490
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,081
You're scared of
boarding airplanes.

491
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,222
What?

492
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:29,061
Wait a minute. What
are you doing here?

493
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:32,432
I want you to leave right now.

494
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:46,541
I'll see you around.

495
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:59,052
Is she a shaman?

496
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:03,892
Is it written on my face
that I'm scared of flights?

497
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,666
<font color="#00ff00">CHEONHWA RICE WINE</font>

498
00:44:20,012 --> 00:44:22,381
Today's the anniversary of
your son's death, isn't it?

499
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,081
So you remember.

500
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:29,282
Where's Granny?

501
00:44:29,782 --> 00:44:31,021
She's probably...

502
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:34,052
going hysterical somewhere.

503
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:39,831
I know you guys
suffered a lot...

504
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:43,162
after what happened to your son.

505
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,202
That's probably why...

506
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:48,302
she was so strict with you.

507
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:53,811
Yes, I've heard it enough.

508
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:56,311
"Love..."

509
00:44:57,142 --> 00:44:59,811
"eventually dies
and disappears."

510
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,521
"I don't understand why you'd
sacrifice your life for love."

511
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:05,992
She always says that because
if you kill yourself,

512
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:09,822
you'll never get the
chance to be reincarnated.

513
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,092
Just like our son, Bok Gil.

514
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:42,392
I have a favor to ask you.

515
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:50,302
I'm willing to do anything now.

516
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:54,501
I'll do anything to save
both myself and that woman.

517
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:16,362
I'm sorry, Mom.

518
00:46:17,722 --> 00:46:20,731
If you were sorry, why
did you kill yourself?

519
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,581
- How have you been?
- Well, as you can see.

520
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,592
So you really did quit drinking.

521
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:21,492
You don't look like
a corpse anymore.

522
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:26,791
I wish my son would be as
attentive as you, Ji A.

523
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:31,161
What are you digging
into this time?

524
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:35,442
Is this life really
our first life?

525
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:38,641
I'm talking about past lives.

526
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:40,972
"Past lives"?

527
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:43,811
I want to do a case study.

528
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:47,951
I hear there are many people who
say they remember their past lives.

529
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:49,981
That's just their claim.

530
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:53,052
But apart from approving
their claims...

531
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:08,501
<font color="#00ff00">"HASSAN, A BOY WHO REMEMBERS
HIS PAST LIFE, SOLVES A MURDER"</font>

532
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:11,172
"A Syrian boy who
remembers his past life"?

533
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:13,572
Ever since he was
four, he asserted...

534
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:16,342
that he was a man named
Mohammed in his past life.

535
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,581
He went to a city he
had never been before,

536
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:21,282
and found the house where
he lived in his past life.

537
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:24,681
He even identified his
neighbor who had killed him.

538
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:27,722
How interesting.

539
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,021
May I borrow this?

540
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:39,331
But...

541
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:42,302
why past lives?

542
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:45,402
I need to come up with something
if I want to make a living.

543
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:47,242
Why?

544
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:50,681
She asked that exact question
while sitting right there.

545
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:54,251
- Who did?
- Your mom.

546
00:48:57,081 --> 00:48:58,121
What?

547
00:48:58,282 --> 00:49:01,291
I gathered those with your mom.

548
00:49:03,822 --> 00:49:06,962
But my mom was a
surgeon. So why...

549
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:12,302
Do you really not
remember anything?

550
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:15,431
Remember what?

551
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,172
When you were nine,

552
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,242
you underwent hypnotherapy...

553
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,041
at your mom's request.

554
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:30,581
Do you believe in past lives?

555
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:32,851
Yes, I do.

556
00:49:33,021 --> 00:49:34,052
Why?

557
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:37,161
You've heard of deja vu, right?

558
00:49:37,222 --> 00:49:41,431
When someone you never met before
seems very familiar to you,

559
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:45,231
or when you go somewhere new,
but it feels very familiar.

560
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:46,672
You've felt things
like that before?

561
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:48,172
When I went
backpacking in Paris.

562
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:50,802
- In the Palace of Versailles.
- Hey.

563
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:54,342
- You?
- Whether or not I believe it aside,

564
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:56,411
I wish there was no such
thing as transmigration.

565
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,981
- Why not?
- I'm working so hard in this life.

566
00:49:59,451 --> 00:50:01,712
What if I'm born as a
mosquito in my next life?

567
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:03,181
Then I'll be a
mosquito repellant.

568
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:08,751
Don't obsess over me just
because we held hands once.

slowly, very slowly,
into a deep sleep.

578
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:37,641
You get out, and you see a door.

579
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:39,882
Do you want to open it?

580
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:42,822
No.

581
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:45,222
It's okay.

582
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,992
I don't want to open it.

583
00:51:48,092 --> 00:51:49,322
Why not?

584
00:51:50,462 --> 00:51:52,862
I feel like something
scary will jump out at me.

585
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:55,802
Then Auntie and
Mommy will scold it.

586
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:00,271
Go ahead. Open the door.

587
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,351
You went in.

588
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:19,822
What do you see?

589
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,391
People. They're wearing hanboks.

590
00:52:26,032 --> 00:52:29,762
But... They're so funny.

591
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:32,371
What's so funny?

592
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:35,101
What are the people doing?

593
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:36,742
They're lying down.

594
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,141
Why are they lying down?

595
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:39,742
Because...

596
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,981
they were killed like animals.

597
00:52:46,052 --> 00:52:49,052
Ji A, do you hear me?

598
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:53,822
Ji A.

599
00:52:57,061 --> 00:53:00,092
Keep it down. You're
too loud. I can't sleep.

600
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,501
Why did you wake me?

601
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:06,302
It isn't time yet.

602
00:53:07,072 --> 00:53:09,242
You are Ji A, aren't you?

603
00:53:09,902 --> 00:53:12,742
I am that kid, and I am not.

604
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:16,311
Who are you?

605
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:19,081
Give me some water.

606
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:27,021
That tastes good.

607
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:39,001
I was born in a
cave on a leap day.

608
00:53:40,331 --> 00:53:41,972
The grave of people
who died of a plague.

609
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:46,742
Where the living and the
dead intermingled together.

610
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,681
It was an Underworld on earth.

611
00:53:51,242 --> 00:53:52,911
One day,

612
00:53:53,052 --> 00:53:55,681
an animal in the form of a
human walked out of the cave.

613
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:59,052
What did the people call it?

614
00:54:00,552 --> 00:54:02,092
Yes. Imoogi.

615
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:08,561
Where is the mountain
spirit now? I must find him.

616
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:19,512
"Do not eat..."

617
00:54:20,012 --> 00:54:22,342
"or drink here."

618
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:28,081
"Please turn off the
editing equipment..."

619
00:54:28,512 --> 00:54:31,181
"if you are the last
person to leave"?

620
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:35,722
There you are.

621
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:47,672
Ji A. What are you doing here?

622
00:54:50,072 --> 00:54:52,911
Hey... I was...

623
00:54:54,242 --> 00:54:55,771
looking at some stuff.

624
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,842
- Why?
- I need to add captions.

625
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:02,351
Okay, I'll clean this up.

626
00:55:24,242 --> 00:55:25,771
Excuse me.

627
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:27,041
I'm not interested.

628
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:31,342
Hey. You don't
have to pay for it,

629
00:55:31,342 --> 00:55:33,481
so at least try it,
good-looking fellow.

630
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:36,751
Hey, lady. Can't you read?

633
00:55:45,192 --> 00:55:47,891
Nuisances like you. Peddlers.

634
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,231
Come now. That's not true.

635
00:55:52,902 --> 00:55:53,972
Get lost.

636
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:03,681
I saw it.

637
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:21,328
Out of all the places, it
had to be this old house.

638
00:57:23,361 --> 00:57:25,122
I must be more wasted
than I thought.

639
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:28,332
The illegitimate child!

640
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:31,801
It's the illegitimate
child born from a fox.

641
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:32,832
Because of him,

642
00:57:32,972 --> 00:57:34,901
the animals in this
town are all dead.

643
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:37,742
- He must've eaten their livers.
- Exactly.

644
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:39,571
- Kill him.
- Get him.

645
00:57:39,571 --> 00:57:41,841
- Die!
- Die!

646
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:45,142
- Kill him.
- Die, you scoundrel.

647
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:46,412
Take that.

648
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,952
- Die.
- Kill him.

649
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:51,452
- Kill him.
- Get him good.

650
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:56,861
Die. Just kill him!

651
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,961
- Die! Kill him.
- Take that.

652
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:39,564
I knew it.

653
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,164
You...

654
00:58:47,535 --> 00:58:49,035
saw everything that day, Mom.

655
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,285
You...

656
00:59:02,854 --> 00:59:04,455
should've never been born.

657
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:10,095
I tried almost everything
to get rid of you...

658
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:12,254
while you were still in my womb.

659
00:59:12,964 --> 00:59:14,765
I drank the brewed liquid
from poisonous plants,

660
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:16,894
rolled down hills,

661
00:59:17,865 --> 00:59:21,434
and even banged my
stomach against rocks.

662
00:59:23,004 --> 00:59:26,374
Being the monster you are,
you just wouldn't die.

663
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:30,175
You even survived the beating
from all those fit men.

664
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:36,515
You...

665
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:40,225
are a monster, my boy.

666
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:50,595
Let's go. You're coming with me!

667
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:52,265
Don't touch me!

668
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:08,245
It's not...

669
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:10,714
a dream?

670
01:00:24,794 --> 01:00:28,604
Could this be the
Forest of the Starved?

671
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:32,604
I hear a spirit.

672
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:45,155
I won't ever die...

673
01:00:45,814 --> 01:00:47,484
because this is when...

674
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:49,725
Sorry. For saving you...

675
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:53,095
when you were abandoned by
your human mom back then.

676
01:00:53,865 --> 01:00:54,894
Yeon...

677
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:58,035
won't come to save me anymore.

678
01:01:25,524 --> 01:01:26,624
I need you,

679
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:28,964
Yeon.

680
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:31,456
<font color="#00ff00">I NEED YOU, YEON.</font>

681
01:01:34,635 --> 01:01:38,035
Miss, try one of these.

682
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:39,705
This one's for free.

683
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:41,504
Sure.

684
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:44,644
Is someone new making
the rounds here now?

685
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:45,975
I don't think I recognize you.

686
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:49,854
A special event takes
place today, you see.

687
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:51,885
An event?

688
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:54,354
You'll soon find
out what that is.

689
01:02:00,825 --> 01:02:03,664
Miss, what do you fear the most?

690
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,934
It must be Yeou Gogae.

691
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:17,214
Ma'am!

692
01:02:41,064 --> 01:02:43,475
Here's your birthday present.

693
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:53,615
<font color="#00ff00">YEOU GOGAE</font>

694
01:02:54,845 --> 01:02:56,044
"Yeou Gogae"?

695
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:28,245
Of all the places,

696
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,484
it had to be the
Forest of the Starved.

697
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:39,464
You...

698
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:40,664
I send my condolences
in advance.

699
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:43,294
If this were a video game,
it'll be the final level.

700
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:46,664
Was this your creation?

701
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:49,405
Just so you know, dying here...

702
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:50,905
will end your life for real.

703
01:03:51,004 --> 01:03:52,104
I'll rip you apart.

704
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:54,144
How about this then?

705
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:58,814
Soon, I will tell your brother
what's happening to you.

706
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,015
Don't get too excited though...

707
01:04:03,615 --> 01:04:06,385
because his girlfriend is
in a similar predicament.

708
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:25,305
Dad. Dad?

709
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,845
Dad, can't you hear
me? Stop the car!

710
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:30,575
Mom!

711
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:35,785
Dad, please stop the car.

712
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:40,084
Dad, stop the car!

713
01:04:55,705 --> 01:04:56,705
Say that again.

714
01:04:57,504 --> 01:05:00,874
As you can see,
there are two doors.

715
01:05:01,504 --> 01:05:04,845
One leads to your brother while
the other leads to your girl.

716
01:05:06,544 --> 01:05:07,845
Which will you choose?

717
01:05:08,515 --> 01:05:09,515
Door number three.

718
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:12,414
I'd rather snap your neck.

719
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:13,655
Then go ahead.

720
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:18,055
Defy the rules and they'll
be stuck there forever.

721
01:05:18,225 --> 01:05:19,524
Imoogi sent you, didn't he?

722
01:05:22,425 --> 01:05:25,195
Let's just say that
we're partners.

723
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:28,805
Lady.

724
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,675
Just you wait.

725
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:34,405
I'll soon pay you
back for the favor.

726
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,044
You'd better hurry.

727
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,374
They're both
running out of time.

728
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:21,325
Mom! Dad! Stop the car!

729
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:24,595
Stop the car! Stop
the car right now!

730
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:45,235
I knew it. That jerk only
cares about his lady.

731
01:07:47,674 --> 01:07:49,044
Hey, kid!

732
01:07:58,155 --> 01:07:59,155
Yeon?

733
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:05,025
I heard what you
just said about me.

734
01:08:06,794 --> 01:08:07,825
I don't need your help.

735
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,165
Now is not the time
to be so arrogant.

736
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:49,065
<font color="#00ff00"><b>TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</b></font>

737
01:08:49,764 --> 01:08:53,304
<i>Will I be able to save
you from this Underworld?</i>

738
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:56,445
<i>I was at the office
just a moment ago.</i>

739
01:08:57,275 --> 01:08:59,245
<i>Don't get intimidated and think.
What really scares you the most?</i>

740
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:00,714
<i>Being abandoned.</i>

741
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,054
<i>- I never once...
- No!</i>

742
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:05,514
<i>abandoned you.</i>

743
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:08,424
<i>Yeon already knew...</i>

744
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:10,254
<i>what he was up against.</i>

745
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:13,254
<i>I'm not alone. I trust Yeon.</i>

746
01:09:13,665 --> 01:09:16,735
<i>Please. I hope I didn't
make the wrong choice.</i>
