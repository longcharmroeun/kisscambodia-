1
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:13,159
No, she must not see it.

2
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:16,159
Put them on, and look at
yourself in the mirror.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,859
It'll give you the
answer to your question.

4
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:15,589
Rain is much needed at times.

5
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,459
For nature, for farmers,

6
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,188
and also for us.

7
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:31,998
Why are you looking
at me that way?

8
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,668
It seems like our time passes...

9
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,308
at a different speed.

10
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,218
You haven't changed since
that first time we met.

11
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:53,858
Does it scare you?

12
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,759
The life and death
of a mortal, I mean.

13
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:01,599
It does.

14
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:05,569
I'm not afraid of growing
old, falling sick, or dying.

15
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,909
But I do worry about...

16
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,608
how you'll be able to
manage the long years...

17
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,138
without me by your side.

18
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,629
As much as I want to stop
time, it never happens.

19
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,048
There we go. I stopped time.

20
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,678
I'll have a good life
even without you.

21
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,319
That's cold.

22
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:29,449
If that's how you feel,

23
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,418
you should lay down your
bow and focus on longevity.

24
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,059
Grow old with gray hair
and a bent spine...

25
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,659
and make me fall out of love.

26
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:40,199
Promise me that won't change
how you will feel about me.

27
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,798
If I ever betray you...

28
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,368
Then what?

29
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,138
Drive an arrow through me.

30
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,259
Ma'am!

31
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,929
I mean, my lady.

32
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,828
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

33
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,169
Must I report using
the privy too?

34
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:17,398
Goodness me.

35
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:20,208
There's a message from the
palace. You have been summoned.

36
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,038
- What?
- You should change first...

37
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,078
Who dares to summon...

38
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,509
the daughter of the King who
was expelled from the palace?

39
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,578
It was the King.

40
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,658
The King, you say?

41
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,319
There's no time to chit-chat.

42
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,888
The Majesty is in
critical condition.

43
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,458
You're a big girl now.

44
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:18,299
And you've grown weak.

45
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,299
How has life been
outside the palace walls?

46
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,638
My eyes have been stinging.

47
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,208
Your eyes...

48
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,809
have been stinging?

49
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,809
Because of the smoke
on the streets.

50
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:39,179
At first, I thought it
came from cooking rice.

51
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:41,049
But that wasn't the case.

52
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,158
It came from burning the bodies
that had starved to death.

53
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,759
It's your people, Father.

54
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,259
The country is...

55
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,199
in an unstable set.

56
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,968
That's what I thought at first,

57
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,569
but it wasn't the case.

58
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,309
It's the King's mind
that is unstable.

59
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:04,379
Because something evil...

60
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,648
has taken control over it.

61
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:24,728
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

62
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,499
You must be Imoogi.

63
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:32,138
Back then and even now,
you're the only person...

64
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,768
who sees me for who I am.

65
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:40,949
Get out.

66
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:44,978
I said, leave his body.

67
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,989
Go on. Why not scream and alert
the others like last time?

68
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,499
Shoot away. His body is
almost destroyed anyway.

69
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:05,869
It wouldn't be so bad...

70
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,869
to have the foolish father...

71
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,739
die at the hands of
the daughter he saved.

72
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:11,138
Enough with the tricks!

73
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,049
Why do you think you got
kicked out of the palace?

74
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:17,778
That's because...

75
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,419
you took over my
father's body...

76
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,559
and manipulated him...

77
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,359
Your father chose
that path for himself!

78
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:29,388
What?

79
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,929
You were born...

80
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,898
to be offered to
me as a sacrifice.

81
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:35,869
Your father...

82
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,468
willingly gave up this
body of his to save you.

83
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,348
Bring me the mountain spirit.

84
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,518
Then I will let
go of your father.

85
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,588
If I stay in his body,
he will be dead...

86
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,759
within three days.

87
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:24,778
Fine.

88
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:27,689
I will bring Yeon to you.

89
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,059
However,

90
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,128
a mountain spirit
belongs in the mountain.

91
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,498
He cannot leave the
place he protects.

92
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,199
- What?
- Let my father go,

93
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:46,539
and come with me.

94
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:50,909
You may...

95
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,309
take my body.

96
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,919
First, let's get him
out of the palace.

97
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,128
Then let's trust in Yeon
to take care of the rest.

98
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,478
She means nothing to me.

99
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,748
- I do not believe you.
- You think you used her as bait.

100
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:34,949
But don't you get it? I used
her as bait to get to you.

101
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,228
Don't kill me!

102
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,569
I don't want to die.

103
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,409
You promised me.

104
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,679
You promised to love
me until the day I die.

105
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,578
- Yeon.
- Show yourself!

106
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:28,699
Did you see it?

107
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,708
Tell me. Did you see it?

108
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,748
Please look at me.

109
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,988
What did you see?

110
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:55,758
I was...

111
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,128
murdered in my past life.

112
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:06,968
You...

113
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,238
killed me.

114
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:16,779
Your sole purpose was
to find the Imoogi.

115
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,679
Yeon.

116
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,218
You used me...

117
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,228
to offer as a sacrifice.

118
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:33,958
Was that...

119
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:37,029
really you?

120
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,639
Yes, it was me.

121
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,409
You were the one
who always saved me?

122
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,449
And I was your first
love whom you've kept...

123
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:49,949
in your heart for
hundreds of years?

124
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,218
Yes.

125
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,449
I killed you.

126
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:02,628
I killed you with
my own two hands.

127
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:06,128
Why?

128
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:12,299
You don't want to see
the tragedy on replay.

129
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:13,868
Either one of you...

130
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,008
must die in the end.

131
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,718
I'm just that kind of person.

132
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,019
That's all you have to say?

133
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:36,828
You swayed me and
made me fall for you,

134
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,258
and that's all you have to say?

135
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,098
At least give me an excuse!

136
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,669
Please.

137
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,578
I had a lot more to gain.

138
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,419
I took your life to save
hundreds of other lives.

139
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,088
After all, I'm a
mountain spirit.

140
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,299
I don't understand...

141
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,269
why my heart aches so much.

142
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,699
Why did I worry about you even
until the moment you killed me?

143
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:21,769
And why am I still crying...

144
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,578
because of you?

145
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,019
Don't be mistaken.

146
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,819
They're not your emotions.

147
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,958
Don't act like
you're that woman...

148
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,858
just because you got to see a
small part of your past life.

149
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,929
You jerk.

150
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:53,069
Yes, I'm a jerk. So don't waste
your emotions on a guy like me.

151
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,669
Make sure you don't make the
same mistake in this life.

152
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:00,978
That way, you'll get
to live a long life.

153
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:24,998
Your rice is cooked.

154
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:54,228
<font color="#00ff00">CHAPTER 8: REINCARNATION</font>

CUISINE: THE SNAIL BRIDE</font>

156
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:01,039
Snail Bride, give me your most
expensive bottle of alcohol.

157
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,279
When will that punk grow up?

158
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,578
Should I open a bottle
of single malt whiskey?

159
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:09,578
Don't give him alcohol.

160
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:12,819
It looks like there's going
to be trouble tonight.

161
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:26,358
Did she see it?

162
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:32,199
I guess she saw her past
life. What did she say?

163
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:36,338
Will you please tell me? I
won't be able to sleep tonight.

164
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,639
Rang.

165
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:41,348
Yes?

166
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,848
What do you want to be
born as in your next life?

167
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,189
What an absurd question.

168
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,189
Tell me.

169
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,159
I don't really care.

170
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,159
If I must choose, a Dokdo
shrimp would be nice.

171
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,998
I like the whiskers on them.

172
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,568
And they're worth
a lot of money.

173
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,439
If I ever get to be born again,
I want to live as a human being.

174
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:11,579
What a pathetic wish.

175
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:17,248
I want my life to be filled
with firsts and lasts.

176
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,689
My first step. My first picnic.

177
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,419
My first love.

178
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,389
Why are you being such a loser?

179
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,159
It has been so long since
we chatted openly like this.

180
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,458
Do you feel sick?

181
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,369
Did you completely snap
after fighting with her?

182
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,568
Imoogi.

183
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:41,768
Where is he?

184
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:43,238
Do you think I'd tell you?

185
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,909
I expected as much.

186
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,409
So that's what you choose.

187
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,700
<font color="#00ff00">WE ARE PREPARING TO SERVE YOU.</font>

188
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:13,899
How about a game?

189
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,169
We used to play often before.

190
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,308
It's no fun playing you.

191
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,149
You've never once beaten me.

192
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,288
Are you going to play or not?

193
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:41,169
Got you.

194
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,968
Yeon, why is the sky blue?

195
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,179
I don't know. I
didn't dye it myself.

196
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,978
When why do owls
go, "hoot hoot"?

197
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,379
I don't know. I
didn't make them hoot.

198
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,278
Why does this
flower taste sweet?

199
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,518
Why do flowers bloom
only in the spring?

200
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,649
Quiet.

201
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,318
Why did you hit me?

202
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,218
Why does a pip-squeak
have so many questions?

203
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,058
I just like hearing your voice.

204
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,629
You're too rash.

205
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:51,339
I told you to cut off the tail.

206
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,568
I told you not to leave
blank spaces for no reason.

207
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,439
I won!

208
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:01,849
I won again!

209
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:04,079
I'm angry.

210
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:08,919
Not bad, kid.

211
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:10,619
I'm not a kid.

212
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,369
Running like that won't work.

213
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,339
It worked! Yes!

214
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,748
It's hard raising a kid.

215
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,958
You're too slow. Again.

216
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,768
You think it's strange
too, don't you?

217
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,968
How did you win every single
time with skills like this?

218
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,008
Shut it.

219
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,179
I let you win.

220
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,778
There was never an exception.

221
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:21,429
I said to shut it.

222
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,288
I don't plan to let
you win anymore.

223
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,568
This is what I wanted to say.

224
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,038
Hey, you. Stop right there.

225
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,839
If you leave now, it's
really over between us.

226
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,419
Sorry.

227
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,058
You're sorry?

228
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,659
Now? What are you sorry for?

229
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:57,558
For saving you...

230
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,629
when you were abandoned by
your human mom back then.

231
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:04,268
Then...

232
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:07,768
we never would've been brothers.

233
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:37,968
Mom?

234
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:45,738
Get away! Get off of me!

235
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:47,379
No!

236
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:05,129
Mom.

237
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:07,099
Mom.

238
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:09,129
Mom.

239
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,699
Are you that?

240
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,669
The thing that my
father had with a human?

241
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:49,669
Are you a fox too?

242
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:55,708
I came to see you because I
heard you had my father's blood,

243
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:57,379
but you're pathetic.

244
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,278
You have no will to live either.

245
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,089
I wasted my time. I'm leaving.

246
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,659
Look. He's still alive.

247
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:11,699
It's an evil spirit. It
doesn't die even if it dies.

248
00:24:12,258 --> 00:24:15,798
The grudge of those who died
of starvation is incessant.

249
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,068
I prefer them over those
who give up easily.

250
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:24,308
Hey.

251
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,909
Live as a human or a
fox. That's up to you.

252
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:30,849
But remember this, kid.

253
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:34,718
There is no salvation to those
who won't save themselves.

254
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,369
Wait for me!

255
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,939
Wait for me, big brother.

256
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:01,768
I'll wait for you right here.

257
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:03,998
Here? All day?

258
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:06,939
When it comes to waiting, no
one can do it better than me.

259
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,268
24 hours? I could sit
there even for 24 years.

260
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:18,278
Gosh, you'll even
outlive me too.

261
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,079
Would you like one? It
seems like you could use it.

262
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,079
I'll pass today.

263
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:29,788
A human's soul leaves a
stink every time you eat it.

264
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:33,419
Their memories invade your dreams
and disrupts your peace as well.

265
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,728
Still, I'm yet alive thanks
to sucking in their lives.

266
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,659
You too, Mr. Lee.

267
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,669
Why ground cherries though?
They give me the creeps.

268
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:46,899
I was told that they resemble
the human soul the most.

269
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,068
Is Imoogi home?

270
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:51,909
I'd like to see him.

271
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,248
Now's not a good time.

272
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:02,189
If he had all the dirty
work taken care of for him,

273
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,949
he should at least show his
gratitude and repay the favor.

274
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,018
If not, he's no different
from being a gold digger.

275
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:11,189
- I can relay the message.
- It's not what I want.

276
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,268
It's for your own sake. I
don't want to see you get hurt.

277
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:16,669
What?

278
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:24,369
Just because I let
you have your fun...

279
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,339
doesn't mean I'm a pushover.

280
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:32,079
You find this funny?

281
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,248
Please let him go.

282
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,869
Are you Imoogi?

283
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:01,008
It's good to meet you. I've
been waiting for this too.

284
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,341
What on earth?

285
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:12,541
You haven't answered
my calls or texts.

286
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:20,621
I have something to discuss. It's
about the dog you brought by.

287
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,521
My gosh. Did it die?

288
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,091
No, that's not it.

289
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,021
Well,

290
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,531
it doesn't have a name.

291
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:34,861
Just give it any random one.

292
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:37,472
No way. A name gives
them an identity.

293
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:40,071
Then carefully think
of one that will work.

294
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:43,111
You're its mother, so...

295
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:47,581
Its mom?

296
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,252
The mom...

297
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,321
Call it Anastasia.

298
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,422
"Anastasia"?

299
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:57,922
What a pretty name.

300
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:00,021
It suits even a male dog.

301
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,591
Of course, it does.

302
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,502
- Why are you gazing at me?
- No reason.

303
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:11,831
I'm glad to know that
I was right about you.

304
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:15,311
Gaze at me like that again...

305
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,512
and it'll be the
last thing you see.

306
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,281
I don't care how
your life has been.

307
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:27,081
For what purpose you
approached me doesn't matter.

308
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:29,091
I'll show you...

309
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,722
that the world is not all evil.

310
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,361
I'll make sure you
regret ever saying that.

311
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,232
I'll look forward to it.

312
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,061
What the...

313
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,071
I'll kill you!

314
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:46,271
See you around.

315
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,781
I thought you were
still a little boy.

316
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,021
You must've been
enjoying a feast.

317
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,922
Can you give us some room?

318
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:06,922
- Are you sure...
- We'll be fine.

319
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,371
Why so sad?

320
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,341
- What?
- You've been gravely hurt.

321
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,712
Cut the nonsense.

322
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:24,672
Was it your brother?

323
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,551
I see it, you know.

324
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,252
You're being
tormented from within.

325
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:39,262
I did not expect you
to be this annoying.

326
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,892
Don't we seem alike?

327
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,692
I personally detest
those who shed skin.

328
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,101
You'd better listen.

329
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:52,101
Regardless of your goal, I
will operate at my own pace.

330
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,702
I can't wait any longer.

331
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:55,202
I see you want to kill her.

332
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,212
But no can do, I'm afraid.

333
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:02,981
Why's that?

334
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,381
Because she was originally
sacrificed to me.

335
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,251
Thus, she will be my bride.

336
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:18,832
Congratulations
on your promotion

337
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,631
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,631
- Are you insane?
- Tell me about it.

339
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:28,171
Ji A, he's been promoted
to department chief.

340
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,812
As if he did anything to
deserve that promotion.

341
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:33,182
Just say you're jealous
since I know you are.

342
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,582
The higher-ups must
still not be aware...

343
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:37,611
of how you spend your hours
doing personal activities.

344
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,952
Playing pool, working out,
singing at a karaoke...

345
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:43,821
Hey, I only went to sing once
on the day I got divorced.

346
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,961
- He sang "She's Gone".
- Hey!

347
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:47,762
Who wants cake?

348
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,001
You seem down today.

349
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:04,372
- It's nothing.
- As if.

350
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,312
I've known you for years now.

351
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:09,211
Did you and your
boyfriend argue?

352
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:12,251
Just make up with him.

353
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,651
If you don't, he'll be the
last man you'll ever date.

354
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:16,591
Wake up, Ji A.

355
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:19,992
Apart from being younger,
you're way out of his league.

356
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,461
That's not the case!

357
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:24,131
Why would you shake her
confidence like that?

358
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,131
But I'm right. It's the truth.

359
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:27,961
- Only we can dispirit her.
- Exactly.

360
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,001
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

361
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:37,512
This is what you get for
acting all high and mighty.

362
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:40,142
- So do you have a new story?
- Yes.

363
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:42,082
I just decided on one.

364
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,151
What is it?

365
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:46,751
Stories about past lives.

366
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:05,501
How about a hug?

367
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,602
- Get lost.
- I'm relieved.

368
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,142
I'm glad you're still yourself.

369
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,082
I made some tofu rice balls.

370
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:20,622
I bet you barely ate or slept.

371
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,651
I'm fine.

372
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:27,821
Just have one. The hint
of vinegar is to die for.

373
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:29,292
I'm not in
kindergarten, you know.

374
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:34,961
Look!

375
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,102
- Seriously?
- Go on and eat.

376
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,571
You need the energy
to protect and serve.

377
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:51,682
I'm curious though. Why
didn't you tell Ms. Nam?

378
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,622
She's mistaken and that
there's more to the story.

379
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:56,992
You could've told her that.

380
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,262
It's all starting again.

381
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,631
If history repeats itself,

382
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,801
that's more of a reason for me
to stay as the bad guy to her.

383
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,071
You're scared, aren't you?

384
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:20,542
You're scared she might
sacrifice herself to save you...

385
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:23,012
just like A Eum.

386
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,292
Are you sure you
won't regret it?

387
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,062
No.

388
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:39,031
But you're still going
to protect her from afar?

389
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:40,461
Yes.

390
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:41,932
Even after you spent all
those years waiting for her?

391
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,501
Yes.

392
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,772
Do you really mean it?

393
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:48,571
I've made up my mind.

394
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,222
Please keep a close eye on her.

395
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,361
The tofu rice ball
tastes delicious.

396
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,001
I'll go with you.

397
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,941
It's okay. I know the
doctor personally.

398
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,972
- What about lunch?
- You guys can eat without me.

399
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,691
Mister.

400
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:43,792
Mister.

401
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:47,662
Why are you ignoring me?

402
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:49,832
Because I don't
want to talk to you.

403
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:52,131
I've been waiting
for you all day.

404
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,372
Why would you wait for me?

405
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:59,381
I thought about what I
want to be in the future.

406
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,651
When I was six years old, I
wanted to be a Triceratops.

407
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,722
But when I turned seven,

408
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:11,622
I thought it'd be cool to be
an owner of an internet cafe.

409
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,091
And when I turned eight...

410
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,531
Get to the point.

411
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:18,361
When I grow up, I
want to be like you.

412
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,631
You're handsome, brave,

413
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,231
and you have superpowers.

414
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,841
We're different in every aspect.

415
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:29,642
- How so?
- Because I hit people first.

416
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:35,142
Judging by your face, someone
must've beaten you up.

417
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,182
Did it happen in
school? Or your home?

418
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,622
I... I didn't get beaten up.

419
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:43,022
It's your choice whether
to beat people up...

420
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:44,251
or get beaten up instead.

421
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,622
But apparently, there
is no salvation...

422
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:51,691
to those who won't
save themselves.

423
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,582
I heard they're stepbrothers,

424
00:39:06,582 --> 00:39:08,182
but I guess it's much more
complicated than that.

425
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,481
I was touched...

426
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,921
by the wonderful smell
of his tainted soul.

427
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:18,821
Why don't we test...

428
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:22,392
whether or not he'll become
another Achilles' heel to Yeon?

429
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:24,662
How?

430
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,562
We're expecting a guest.

431
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:35,142
My goodness. Let me help.

432
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,341
Hurry up and take it.

433
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:37,872
- Here.
- Thank you.

434
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

435
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:41,812
What do we have here?

436
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,452
This plum tea smells amazing.

437
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,551
We received organic
plums from Hadong.

438
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,492
"Hadong"? Goodness, no wonder.

439
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:55,091
I once went to the plum
festival in Hadong for work.

440
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,932
- And that was back in...
- Ma'am.

441
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,932
The petals were falling down.

442
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,332
And the scenery was...

443
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:05,401
I'll take you there one day.

444
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,171
I promise. Goodness.

445
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:13,381
What... What are you looking at?

446
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,781
You never went to the
plum festival for work.

447
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,122
What are you doing here?

448
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:26,762
I came to a restaurant to
eat. Why else would I be here?

449
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:30,231
Everyone knows what
a great cook you are.

450
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:32,461
You should leave.

451
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:36,602
I might as well give the
leftover rice to mice.

452
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:38,602
But there's no rice for you.

453
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:42,001
You little wench.

454
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:44,742
Have you lost your mind...

455
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,912
after having lived as a
widow for hundreds of years?

456
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,711
If that's not it,

457
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,522
have you forgotten who I am?

458
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:57,292
How could I ever forget you?

459
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:02,091
I lost my husband
because of you.

460
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:05,191
My goodness, you
are unbelievable.

461
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:08,162
Are you still not over
that foolish farmer?

462
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:12,901
Why did you do that to him?

463
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,272
Everyone lives with
a painful memory...

464
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:19,042
of their own.

465
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:23,611
I just reminded your husband
of his trauma like I always do.

466
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,251
But he was the one who chose
to live in that bubble.

467
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:29,151
You should blame him for
being so mentally weak.

468
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,852
Why? Why did it have to be him?

469
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,421
To be more exact,

470
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:37,432
you should ask why
it had to be you.

471
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:40,332
What?

472
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:41,762
You see,

473
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,932
I really hate people like you.

474
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,841
The main characters of famous
traditional fairy tales.

475
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:52,341
Unlike you, no one
ever remembers my name.

476
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:56,981
Are you okay?

477
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,022
Do you need help?

478
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:09,492
- Don't let it bother you.
- How could I not let it bother me?

479
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:12,162
Listen, ma'am.

480
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:15,602
If you don't like it here,
just go eat somewhere else.

481
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:19,001
You could come out on the news
for being a rude customer.

482
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:23,272
What do you fear the most?

483
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:27,211
What?

484
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:31,981
You're scared of
boarding airplanes.

485
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:36,122
What?

486
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:39,961
Wait a minute. What
are you doing here?

487
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,332
I want you to leave right now.

488
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:57,441
I'll see you around.

489
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,952
Is she a shaman?

490
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:14,792
Is it written on my face
that I'm scared of flights?

491
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,566
<font color="#00ff00">CHEONHWA RICE WINE</font>

492
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:33,281
Today's the anniversary of
your son's death, isn't it?

493
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:35,981
So you remember.

494
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,182
Where's Granny?

495
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:41,921
She's probably...

496
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,952
going hysterical somewhere.

497
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:50,731
I know you guys
suffered a lot...

498
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:54,062
after what happened to your son.

499
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,102
That's probably why...

500
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:59,202
she was so strict with you.

501
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:04,711
Yes, I've heard it enough.

502
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:07,211
"Love..."

503
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:10,711
"eventually dies
and disappears."

504
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,421
"I don't understand why you'd
sacrifice your life for love."

505
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:16,892
She always says that because
if you kill yourself,

506
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:20,722
you'll never get the
chance to be reincarnated.

507
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:24,992
Just like our son, Bok Gil.

508
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:53,292
I have a favor to ask you.

509
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:01,202
I'm willing to do anything now.

510
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:05,401
I'll do anything to save
both myself and that woman.

511
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,262
I'm sorry, Mom.

512
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:31,631
If you were sorry, why
did you kill yourself?

513
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:26,481
- How have you been?
- Well, as you can see.

514
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:30,492
So you really did quit drinking.

515
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,392
You don't look like
a corpse anymore.

516
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:37,691
I wish my son would be as
attentive as you, Ji A.

517
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:42,061
What are you digging
into this time?

518
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,342
Is this life really
our first life?

519
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,541
I'm talking about past lives.

520
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:51,872
"Past lives"?

521
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,711
I want to do a case study.

522
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:58,851
I hear there are many people who
say they remember their past lives.

523
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:00,881
That's just their claim.

524
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,952
But apart from approving
their claims...

525
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:19,401
<font color="#00ff00">"HASSAN, A BOY WHO REMEMBERS
HIS PAST LIFE, SOLVES A MURDER"</font>

526
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:22,072
"A Syrian boy who
remembers his past life"?

527
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:24,472
Ever since he was
four, he asserted...

528
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:27,242
that he was a man named
Mohammed in his past life.

529
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:29,481
He went to a city he
had never been before,

530
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:32,182
and found the house where
he lived in his past life.

531
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:35,581
He even identified his
neighbor who had killed him.

532
00:47:37,552 --> 00:47:38,622
How interesting.

533
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,921
May I borrow this?

534
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:50,231
But...

535
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,202
why past lives?

536
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,302
I need to come up with something
if I want to make a living.

537
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:58,142
Why?

538
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:01,581
She asked that exact question
while sitting right there.

539
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:05,151
- Who did?
- Your mom.

540
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:09,021
What?

541
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:12,191
I gathered those with your mom.

542
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:17,862
But my mom was a
surgeon. So why...

543
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:23,202
Do you really not
remember anything?

544
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:26,331
Remember what?

545
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:28,072
When you were nine,

546
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,142
you underwent hypnotherapy...

547
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:32,941
at your mom's request.

548
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,481
Do you believe in past lives?

549
00:48:41,722 --> 00:48:43,751
Yes, I do.

550
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,952
Why?

551
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:48,061
You've heard of deja vu, right?

552
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:52,331
When someone you never met before
seems very familiar to you,

553
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:56,131
or when you go somewhere new,
but it feels very familiar.

554
00:48:56,131 --> 00:48:57,572
You've felt things
like that before?

555
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,072
When I went
backpacking in Paris.

556
00:48:59,742 --> 00:49:01,702
- In the Palace of Versailles.
- Hey.

557
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:05,242
- You?
- Whether or not I believe it aside,

558
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,311
I wish there was no such
thing as transmigration.

559
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:09,881
- Why not?
- I'm working so hard in this life.

560
00:49:10,351 --> 00:49:12,612
What if I'm born as a
mosquito in my next life?

561
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,081
Then I'll be a
mosquito repellant.

562
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,651
Don't obsess over me just
because we held hands once.

00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:43,412
slowly, very slowly,
into a deep sleep.

572
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:48,541
You get out, and you see a door.

573
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:50,782
Do you want to open it?

574
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:53,722
No.

575
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,122
It's okay.

576
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:58,892
I don't want to open it.

577
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,222
Why not?

578
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,762
I feel like something
scary will jump out at me.

579
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:06,702
Then Auntie and
Mommy will scold it.

580
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:11,171
Go ahead. Open the door.

581
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,251
You went in.

582
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:30,722
What do you see?

583
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:36,291
People. They're wearing hanboks.

584
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:40,662
But... They're so funny.

585
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:43,271
What's so funny?

586
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,001
What are the people doing?

587
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:47,642
They're lying down.

588
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:49,041
Why are they lying down?

589
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,642
Because...

590
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:54,881
they were killed like animals.

591
00:51:56,952 --> 00:51:59,952
Ji A, do you hear me?

592
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,722
Ji A.

593
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,992
Keep it down. You're
too loud. I can't sleep.

594
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:15,401
Why did you wake me?

595
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:17,202
It isn't time yet.

596
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:20,142
You are Ji A, aren't you?

597
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:23,642
I am that kid, and I am not.

598
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,211
Who are you?

599
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:29,981
Give me some water.

600
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:37,921
That tastes good.

601
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:49,901
I was born in a
cave on a leap day.

602
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,872
The grave of people
who died of a plague.

603
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:57,642
Where the living and the
dead intermingled together.

604
00:52:58,711 --> 00:53:00,581
It was an Underworld on earth.

605
00:53:02,142 --> 00:53:03,811
One day,

606
00:53:03,952 --> 00:53:06,581
an animal in the form of a
human walked out of the cave.

607
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:09,952
What did the people call it?

608
00:53:11,452 --> 00:53:12,992
Yes. Imoogi.

609
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,461
Where is the mountain
spirit now? I must find him.

610
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:30,412
"Do not eat..."

611
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:33,242
"or drink here."

612
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:38,981
"Please turn off the
editing equipment..."

613
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:42,081
"if you are the last
person to leave"?

614
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:46,622
There you are.

615
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:58,572
Ji A. What are you doing here?

616
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:03,811
Hey... I was...

617
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,671
looking at some stuff.

618
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,742
- Why?
- I need to add captions.

619
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:13,251
Okay, I'll clean this up.

620
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:36,671
Excuse me.

621
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:37,941
I'm not interested.

622
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:42,242
Hey. You don't
have to pay for it,

623
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:44,381
so at least try it,
good-looking fellow.

624
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:47,651
Hey, lady. Can't you read?

627
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,791
Nuisances like you. Peddlers.

628
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,131
Come now. That's not true.

629
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:04,872
Get lost.

630
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,581
I saw it.

631
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:32,328
Out of all the places, it
had to be this old house.

632
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,122
I must be more wasted
than I thought.

633
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:39,332
The illegitimate child!

634
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:42,801
It's the illegitimate
child born from a fox.

635
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:43,832
Because of him,

636
00:56:43,972 --> 00:56:45,901
the animals in this
town are all dead.

637
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:48,742
- He must've eaten their livers.
- Exactly.

638
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,571
- Kill him.
- Get him.

639
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:52,841
- Die!
- Die!

640
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:56,142
- Kill him.
- Die, you scoundrel.

641
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:57,412
Take that.

642
00:56:58,381 --> 00:56:59,952
- Die.
- Kill him.

643
00:57:00,352 --> 00:57:02,452
- Kill him.
- Get him good.

644
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,861
Die. Just kill him!

645
00:57:12,231 --> 00:57:14,961
- Die! Kill him.
- Take that.

646
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:50,564
I knew it.

647
00:57:55,095 --> 00:57:56,164
You...

648
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:00,035
saw everything that day, Mom.

649
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:12,285
You...

650
00:58:13,854 --> 00:58:15,455
should've never been born.

651
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:21,095
I tried almost everything
to get rid of you...

652
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:23,254
while you were still in my womb.

653
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:25,765
I drank the brewed liquid
from poisonous plants,

654
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:27,894
rolled down hills,

655
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:32,434
and even banged my
stomach against rocks.

656
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:37,374
Being the monster you are,
you just wouldn't die.

657
00:58:38,104 --> 00:58:41,175
You even survived the beating
from all those fit men.

658
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:47,515
You...

659
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:51,225
are a monster, my boy.

660
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:01,595
Let's go. You're coming with me!

661
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:03,265
Don't touch me!

662
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:19,245
It's not...

663
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:21,714
a dream?

664
00:59:35,794 --> 00:59:39,604
Could this be the
Forest of the Starved?

665
00:59:42,604 --> 00:59:43,604
I hear a spirit.

666
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,155
I won't ever die...

667
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:58,484
because this is when...

668
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:00,725
Sorry. For saving you...

669
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:04,095
when you were abandoned by
your human mom back then.

670
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:05,894
Yeon...

671
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:09,035
won't come to save me anymore.

672
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:37,624
I need you,

673
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:39,964
Yeon.

674
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:42,456
<font color="#00ff00">I NEED YOU, YEON.</font>

675
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:49,035
Miss, try one of these.

676
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:50,705
This one's for free.

677
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:52,504
Sure.

678
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:55,644
Is someone new making
the rounds here now?

679
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:56,975
I don't think I recognize you.

680
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:00,854
A special event takes
place today, you see.

681
01:01:01,854 --> 01:01:02,885
An event?

682
01:01:03,385 --> 01:01:05,354
You'll soon find
out what that is.

683
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:14,664
Miss, what do you fear the most?

684
01:01:18,265 --> 01:01:19,934
It must be Yeou Gogae.

685
01:01:27,144 --> 01:01:28,214
Ma'am!

686
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:54,475
Here's your birthday present.

687
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,615
<font color="#00ff00">YEOU GOGAE</font>

688
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:07,044
"Yeou Gogae"?

689
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:39,245
Of all the places,

690
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:40,484
it had to be the
Forest of the Starved.

691
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:50,464
You...

692
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:51,664
I send my condolences
in advance.

693
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:54,294
If this were a video game,
it'll be the final level.

694
01:02:56,535 --> 01:02:57,664
Was this your creation?

695
01:02:57,805 --> 01:03:00,405
Just so you know, dying here...

696
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,905
will end your life for real.

697
01:03:02,004 --> 01:03:03,104
I'll rip you apart.

698
01:03:03,635 --> 01:03:05,144
How about this then?

699
01:03:06,305 --> 01:03:09,814
Soon, I will tell your brother
what's happening to you.

700
01:03:12,644 --> 01:03:14,015
Don't get too excited though...

701
01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:17,385
because his girlfriend is
in a similar predicament.

702
01:03:34,635 --> 01:03:36,305
Dad. Dad?

703
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:39,845
Dad, can't you hear
me? Stop the car!

704
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:41,575
Mom!

705
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:46,785
Dad, please stop the car.

706
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:51,084
Dad, stop the car!

707
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:07,705
Say that again.

708
01:04:08,504 --> 01:04:11,874
As you can see,
there are two doors.

709
01:04:12,504 --> 01:04:15,845
One leads to your brother while
the other leads to your girl.

710
01:04:17,544 --> 01:04:18,845
Which will you choose?

711
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:20,515
Door number three.

712
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:23,414
I'd rather snap your neck.

713
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:24,655
Then go ahead.

714
01:04:25,524 --> 01:04:29,055
Defy the rules and they'll
be stuck there forever.

715
01:04:29,225 --> 01:04:30,524
Imoogi sent you, didn't he?

716
01:04:33,425 --> 01:04:36,195
Let's just say that
we're partners.

717
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:39,805
Lady.

718
01:04:41,635 --> 01:04:42,675
Just you wait.

719
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:45,405
I'll soon pay you
back for the favor.

720
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:47,044
You'd better hurry.

721
01:04:47,975 --> 01:04:50,374
They're both
running out of time.

722
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:32,325
Mom! Dad! Stop the car!

723
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:35,595
Stop the car! Stop
the car right now!

724
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:56,035
I knew it. That jerk only
cares about his lady.

725
01:06:58,474 --> 01:06:59,844
Hey, kid!

726
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:09,955
Yeon?

727
01:07:14,224 --> 01:07:15,825
I heard what you
just said about me.

728
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:18,625
I don't need your help.

729
01:07:20,094 --> 01:07:21,965
Now is not the time
to be so arrogant.

730
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:59,865
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

731
01:08:00,564 --> 01:08:04,104
<i>Will I be able to save
you from this Underworld?</i>

732
01:08:04,104 --> 01:08:07,245
<i>I was at the office
just a moment ago.</i>

733
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:10,045
<i>Don't get intimidated and think.
What really scares you the most?</i>

734
01:08:10,445 --> 01:08:11,514
<i>Being abandoned.</i>

735
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:14,854
<i>- I never once...
- No!</i>

736
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:16,314
<i>abandoned you.</i>

737
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,224
<i>Yeon already knew...</i>

738
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,054
<i>what he was up against.</i>

739
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:24,054
<i>I'm not alone. I trust Yeon.</i>

740
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:27,535
<i>Please. I hope I didn't
make the wrong choice.</i>
