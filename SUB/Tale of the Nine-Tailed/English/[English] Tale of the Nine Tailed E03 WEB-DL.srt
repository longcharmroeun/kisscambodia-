Being at sea wasn't enough and
he drowned himself to death.

22
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,004
He drowned?

23
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:24,874
In that toilet?

24
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,944
I fished his head out myself.

25
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:29,675
Look at how bloated
his stomach is.

26
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,744
That's all due to him
chugging down water.

27
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:38,284
Please call the police, Captain,
and close off this restroom.

28

Talk about it being
all for nothing.

29
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:44,724
This is what he gets after
throwing himself at his life.

30
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:46,964
What do you mean by that?

31
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:50,534
He was on The Galaxy,
the fishing boat...

32
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,205
that flipped over.

33
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:56,274
Then he was on that boat
with Pyung Hee's father.

34
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:58,805
Yes, there were four
of them in total.

35
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,744
Is this the police?

36
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,485
I see someone threw a party.

37
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,124
- What's wrong?
- It stinks.

38
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,594
What do you mean?

39
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,555
He smells like a stinky fish.

40
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,194
The body hasn't had time
to decompose yet though.

41
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,504
Hair?

42
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,244
But his is Gray.

43
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,115
I smell the sea...

44
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:46,024
and a faint scent of the
duvet from that house.

45
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:50,224
That house? You mean,
Pyung Hee's house?

That man. It's the same guy.

50
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,574
Four men were on board
The Galaxy that sunk.

51
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,285
Three returned
home in one piece,

52
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,814
- but one...
- Only his head came back to shore.

By the looks of it,
he won't be the last.

56
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,124
Are you saying more
people could die?

57
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:03,465
Then we should get going.

Why?

59
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:06,805
To stop it, of course.

60
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,704
- I don't want to.
- What?

61
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,305
It's not my job.

62
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,244
Besides, they're not
good looking enough.

63
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:13,305

who lost his head that day.

81
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,874
Get out of my house. Get lost.

82
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,374
I'll leave when I want to.

What happened on the boat?

88
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:44,525
We met an unexpected
storm that day.

89
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,665
The weather forecast was wrong.

90
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,095
Then why did only
three of you survive?

91
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,334
Mr. Seo got swept
away by the waves.

92
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,865
And we were lost out in the sea.

93
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,634
- And then?
- That's all I remember.

94
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,235
I swear!

95
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,475
- When I woke up, I was onshore.
- Okay. I'll start with your pinkie.

96
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,574
Wait.

97
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:08,715
I bet you were scared.

98
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:13,454
You spent 28 days on that lifeboat
without any food or water.

99
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,555
It's just the right condition
for you to lose your mind.

100
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,765
The strong sunlight would've
caused your skin to burn.

101
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,464
And even with an empty stomach, I
bet you were constantly seasick.

102
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,464
You were probably sick of waiting
for someone to come save you,

103
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:28,974
and I bet you got angry the
more you thought about it.

104
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,474
"Why me? Why?"

105
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:31,574
Shut it!

106
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:33,805
The fifth day was
probably the worst...

107
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,844
because it hadn't rained at all.

108
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:39,145
First, you would've
gotten dehydrated.

109
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:45,425
Please help us.

110
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:00,334
Are you crazy?

111
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,135
Are you trying to die?

112
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,645
We're all going to die anyway.

113
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,545
I don't want to die.

114
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,915
- I don't want to die.
- My goodness.

115
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,984

116
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:20,484

But it's strange.

but you didn't lose much weight.

124
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:52,324
You didn't have Wi-Fi, so you
couldn't have ordered delivery food.

- What did you eat?
- Stop!

126
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,224

127
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,864
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

129
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,444
refuse to die out here.

130
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,844
What's the matter with you
guys? What are you doing?

131
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:17,974
Don't do this. Please.

132
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,645
I'm not going to die!

133

I'm starving.

136
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:40,135
It's meat.

00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,055
Meat. My meat.

144
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,344
Is this hair?

145
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,084

What were you doing
while I was busy working?

165
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,055
You were watching a
drama, weren't you?

166
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,255
No.

167
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,425
I was watering the
Euiryeong Tree.

168
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,425
You watered a tree
for three hours?

169
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:19,165
Honey, my diligence isn't
important. The list is a mess.

170
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,665
I'll hurry up and fix the
regional mortality statistics.

171
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:24,594
Wait here for a moment.

172
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,864
Oh, I almost forgot.

173
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,844
I wonder what kind of
trouble is waiting to happen.

174
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,675
I've seen lots of paintings...

175
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,175
as I gathered information
for my TV show.

176
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:11,974
But I've never seen a painting
that gives me the chills like this.

177
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,145
I wonder why.

178
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,395
There's something
missing in this drawing.

179
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:28,014
<font color="#00ff00">THE PAINTING OF
THE DRAGON KING</font>

180
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:33,834
You startled me.

181
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,275
Oh, sorry.

182
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,305
Do you seriously have an
appetite for that right now?

183
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,405
Why? It's my favourite snack.

184
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,844
Two people died.

185
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,245
So what?

186
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,844
Why can't you give me a
more reasonable reaction?

187
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,854
Do you know how many
people in Joseon died...

188
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:52,984
during the 50 years of war?

189
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,155
3.5 million.

190
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,625
I've seen more deaths...

191
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,194
than all the funeral
companies in this country.

192
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:00,995
I'm sure there was
at least one death...

193
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,564
that made your heart ache
among those 3.5 million people.

194
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,795
Take a look at this.

195
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,665
The same painting was also
in that house earlier.

196
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,395
Isn't this a portrait
of the Dragon King?

197
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,464
Yes, but it looks
nothing like him.

198
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:44,005
- You saw him?
- Back when I was a mountain spirit.

199
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:46,405
We were in the same
leadership program.

200
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,875
People glamorized him too much.
He's not this good-looking.

201
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:56,354
This painting is a little different
from the ones I've seen before.

202
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:59,454
Look. This is the
usual painting.

203
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,125
Do you notice what's different?

204
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,255
This is just like
"Where's Wally?"

205
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:15,434
This has no feet.

206
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:17,574
Feet?

207
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,444
You're right.

208
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,045
A dragon that has no feet.
Do you get what this is?

209
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:27,245
This isn't a dragon.
It's a snake.

210
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,515
It's an Imoogi.

211
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,824
Are you Lee Rang?

212
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:14,164
I've been waiting.

213
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,594
Is that really asleep in here?

214
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,634
Yes. The spirit of immorality.

215
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,235
The king of the corrupt.

216
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,505
Lee Ryong.

217
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,604
Oh, my goodness.

218
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,674
That was so cringy.

219
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,445
Adding a title from the afterlife
in front of their name...

220
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,045
doesn't change who they were.

221
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,285
He died while facing
off against Yeon, right?

222
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:40,725
Along with that human woman.

223
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,725
Prior to entering
the wench's body,

224
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:48,765
he entrusted our family of
shamans a portion of his body.

225
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,195
I guess he never goes all in.

226
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,965
He's the opposite of me.

227
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,805
Anyway, are you ready?

228
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,245
A woman born in the year of
the sheep. A living sacrifice.

229
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,604
- And...
- Leave Yeon to me.

230
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,874
Go to the cemetery and pick
some evening primroses...

231
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,285
that grew on the flesh
and blood of corpses.

232
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,314
Let me ask you something.

233
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:19,624
Are you not brothers
with Lee Yeon?

234
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,295
We are brothers.

235
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,634
Half-brothers, to be exact.

236
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:28,834
If he awakes,

237
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,475
Lee Yeon will not survive.

238
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,305
- So?
- Why are you...

239
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,144
aiding your brother's enemy?

240
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,814
Come here.

241
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,225
- What is it?
- Pack your things and leave.

242
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:51,094
As soon as possible. Leave
this wretched island.

243
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:52,424
What?

244
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:53,564
I have a bad feeling about this.

245
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:55,265
What do you mean?

246
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:57,894
I'm saying you may
die if you stay here.

247
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:04,435
You said you weren't here to save
anyone. Why am I an exception?

248
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,104
That's none of your business.

249
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:11,614
I won't go home for a
reason I don't know.

250
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:15,015
So you can find the
person you came to meet.

251
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,414
I need to find out why
my mom and dad came here.

252
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,364
Why am I aiding the enemy
of my own blood relative?

253
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:30,164
It's a good practice not to fully
trust your business partner.

254
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,364
That's not what I meant.

255
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,374
Did you see Yeon while
he was a mountain spirit?

256
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,134
I heard about him
only through rumours.

257
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,475
What was the rumour?

258
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:45,245
The most merciless of the four
mountain spirits that rule the land.

259
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,255
No one could dare
exploit his woods,

260
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,824
and thus the Baekdudaegan
Mountain Range was always lush.

261
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,195
My brother was a mountain
spirit in name only.

262
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,094
He had no sense of altruism.

263
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,795
But you know,

264
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,164
even when we shared an apple,

265
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:08,265
he always gave me
the bigger half.

266
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,144
I still remember how
sweet that apple tasted.

267
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:15,545
Then why...

268
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:18,574
He used that tender hand with
which he sliced the apple...

269
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:21,015
to slice my stomach.

270
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:26,884
Obviously, it scarred me emotionally
much more than it did physically.

271
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,555
- Is that why...
- I'm a fox after all.

272
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,624
I need to return the favour.

273
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,435
I'm determined to go
to the Underworld...

274
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,305
together with Yeon.

275
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:02,084
Ms. Nam, I came to the
library as you asked.

276
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:05,795
But what am I looking
for? Dead bodies?

277
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:10,834
So... You mean chopped
up bodies, right?

278
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:13,604
Run a search for "Eohwa Island" and
find every incident or accident.

279
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:15,634
Call me if you find anything.

280
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,935
What are you looking for?

281
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,205
I'm bothered by something
the old ladies here said.

282
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:21,904
You can't tell anyone...
that you heard it from us.

283
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:23,614
This isn't the first time.

284
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,674
The human head...

285
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:31,515
Granny.

286
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,525
Did you hear anything about
that punk from before?

287
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:36,894
What punk?

288
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:39,465
Imoogi.

289
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,364
Didn't you...

290
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,364
end his life with
your own hands?

291
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,634
- I did.
- Then?

292
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:51,235
Just because. I'm just worried.

293
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,275
If by chance A Eum was
born again into this world,

294
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:58,015
I can't let that thing
coexist with her.

295
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,314
Such devotion.

296
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:04,255
- How would I not know if that...
- Okay, bye.

297
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:07,755
Look at this rude punk.

298
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:27,475
- Hi, Pyung Hee.
- Hello.

299
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,015
What are you reading?

300
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:40,354
What's wrong?

301
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:42,584
You're not Pyung Hee, are you?

302
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,495
How are you...

303
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,505
This is the best place to read.

304
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,604
Anyway. You're all alone.

305
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,144
He's nearby.

306
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,614
No, he isn't.

307
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,584
I can smell him
better than anyone.

308
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:15,217
Anyway. You're all alone.

309
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,416
He's nearby.

310
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,126
No, he isn't.

311
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:22,787
I can smell him
better than anyone.

312
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,037
You're the one who
killed the fishermen.

313
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:37,636
You shouldn't go around accusing
people. Do you have proof?

314
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:39,977
That book.

315
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,876
This? I like the classics.

316
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:46,386
"Moby Dick" is a novel
based on true events.

317
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,247
A whaling ship that sank
in the 19th century.

318
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:50,586
What happened to it?

319
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:53,487
It ate and was eaten.

320
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:56,126
Just like Pyung Hee's father.

321
00:24:58,057 --> 00:25:00,896
Oh, my gosh. You scared
me half to death.

322
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,237
Look at this.

323
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,336
It's here too.

324
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,267
What are you doing?

325
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,047
I'll ask the questions.

326
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,047
I asked, what are you doing?

327
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,447
I said only I ask the questions.

328
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,987
If you don't answer my questions,
you'll never cast a net again.

329
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,626
Explain this painting.

330
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:34,467
But you know, if I were the
killer, I'd need a motive.

331
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,767
What was my motive? For justice?

332
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,737
I wasn't sure until a
moment ago, but I am now.

333
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,376
The fishermen's deaths
are like a fireworks show.

334
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:48,346
A fireworks show.

335
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,777
You're drawing attention
with outrageous incidents...

336
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:53,447
to distract us.
That's your motive.

337
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,146
- Why?
- Probably...

338
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:58,416
to hide the real reason
you're on this island.

339
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:06,767
Awesome. You're quite
smart for a human woman.

340
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:09,326
Since you got the answer right,

341
00:26:10,596 --> 00:26:11,737
I should reward you.

342
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,507
You're looking for
your parents, right?

343
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,336
- Give me that.
- Why?

344
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,876
You saw them in your dream.

345
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:22,307
How do you know?

346
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:23,816
Just say the word.

347
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,386
Who knows?

348
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,916
I may have the answer.

349
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:35,287
Can you really find them?

350
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:38,856
That's right. Should
I grant you...

351
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:40,967
that wish?

352
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,406
I asked what this painting was.

353
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:54,247
It... It's the Dragon King.

354
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:57,346
He calms the storms...

355
00:26:57,346 --> 00:26:59,346
and sends fish to fishermen.

356
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,146
There are big
rituals for him too.

357
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:04,687
- Liar.
- Fishing isn't like farming.

358
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,787
It isn't within human control.

359
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:10,856
- I'll just cut it.
- I'm telling the truth!

360
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:13,666
Where did you get this painting?

361
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,537
One of the village ladies
bought them from mainland...

362
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,037
for each and every household.

363
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:21,207
Just ask anyone!

364
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:32,777
Forget everything you just saw.

365
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:41,126
- How much is it?
- Goodness. When did you get here?

366
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:42,527
That'll be a dollar.

367
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,626
How many of you came as
part of the production team?

368
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:51,166
A pretty boy came by and
asked for directions...

369
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,066
to Pyung Hee's house.

370
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:56,537
Pretty boy?

371
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,747
I only need to hear one word.

372
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:06,047
"Yes."

373
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:19,656
I decline.

374
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,767
Why is that?

375
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,497
Foxes never stay in debt, right?

376
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,906
In other words, you
always collect on favours.

377
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,106
Loosen up, will you?

378
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,646
Why be so stiff when
it's just good old me?

379
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:36,146
Let me give you some advice
since that's how you feel.

380
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:40,116
Don't gamble with another's
tragedy just for kicks.

381
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,987
There's a word for people
like you, you know.

382
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,886
A colossal jerk.

383
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:51,826
You have no idea how much
I hate vulgar speech.

384
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,926
Call me that again
and I'll kill you.

385
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:58,237
Why me? Why are
you messing with...

386
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,366
I'm done talking to you.

387
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:06,237
Here's some advice in return.

388
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:08,707
Don't put too much
trust in Lee Yeon.

389
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,547
What do you mean?

390
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:16,386
When he finds what he wants,
you'll be begging for mercy.

391
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:41,346
He left.

392
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,646
You're still in one piece.

393
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,717
What did he say?

394
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:50,457
He said he could find
my parents for me.

395
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:52,787
And?

396
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:57,797
Even when I order pizza, I
never go for a half-and-half.

397
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,527
I always choose just one.

398
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:02,297
What are you getting at?

399
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:03,866
I turned him down...

400
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,037
because you're the
fox I'm betting on.

401
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:13,106
Smart lady.

402
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:15,606
Is that all?

403
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,316
Don't put too much
trust in Lee Yeon.

404
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:20,586
Yes, that's all.

405
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,116
Well, I'm famished.

406
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:25,287
How about you take your own
advice and leave the island?

407
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,787
- What?
- Your brother.

408
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:32,227
He's cooking up
some sort of event.

409
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:33,426
And that's what I'm waiting for.

410
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:57,217
Seriously?

411
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,156
Not a familiar face, right?

412
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,057
She's not domestic.

413
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,626
- Then?
- She's probably from abroad.

414
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,896
That explains her
sophisticated look.

415
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,537
How much in jewellery
is she wearing?

416
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,336
Who booked the table?

417
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:21,547
Ki Yu Ri. She's the director
of Moze Department Store.

418
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,376
She doesn't seem like
a self-made woman.

419
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,176
Maybe she won the lottery.

420
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:28,217
Foxes who reek of
money and power...

421
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:29,957
fall into one of
these two categories.

422
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,356
They either come from a prestigious
bloodline like Mr. Lee Yeon...

423
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:36,057
or they broke taboo
and stole a human life.

424
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,406
Sitting here like this
makes me wonder...

425
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:58,517
if all that happened
this morning was a dream.

426
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:04,217
If only life could be just
as uneventful every day.

427
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,457
Then settle in the countryside.

428
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,396
Don't you miss the nature?

429
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,957
Not really. There aren't
any department stores.

430
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,826
Also, I can't live
without black coffee...

431
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:16,396
and mint chocolate
ice cream anymore.

432
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,197
Some fox you are.

433
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,507
Life's the same for everyone.

434
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:25,076
Just because these ladies wear
baggy pants in floral prints...

435
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,846
doesn't mean they
have kind hearts.

436
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:30,846
Get digging, and you'll find
all sorts of dirty secrets.

437
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:35,687
Is that the case for you too?

438
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:40,356
I'm just curious as to
how your life has been...

439
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,457
for all those centuries.

440
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:47,896
What about you then?

441
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:51,497
Why have you been searching
for your parents all this time?

442
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,066
It's simple.

443
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,477
I miss them, that's all.
I miss my mom and dad.

444
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,316
Same here.

445
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:08,487
I'm waiting for the one I miss.

446
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,457
Your first love? Was it human...

447
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,027
or a fox?

448
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:21,497
Why did you part ways when
you still miss her this much?

449
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,106
I see you won't tell me.

450
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:34,207
The first being I loved was a
human girl who ended up dying.

451
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:37,524
It's why I'm still hung
up on her. Happy now?

452
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:40,419
But you said you're
waiting for her.

453
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,803
You're waiting for
someone who's dead?

454
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:50,904
She promised...

455
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,035
to be reborn.

456
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,466
Here. Clean up for me too.

457
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,196
Only the staff can enter.

458
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:30,136
Gosh, my bad.

459
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,937
I don't think it was a mistake.

460
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:38,576
Do I look like someone who
resorts to petty theft?

461
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:41,046
How about we exchange names?

462
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,946
We are of the same
species, after all.

463
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,817
I'm Yu Ri.

464
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,346
Technically, we're
not the same species.

465
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,787
I take it you're from Russia.

466
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:54,986
- Sharp, aren't you?
- How did you come to Korea?

467
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,457
- Were you...
- Yes, I was smuggled.

468
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:01,026
Have you been on a
nine-hour flight...

469
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,897
squeezed between
Makarov pistols before?

470
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:05,236
The moment we landed,

471
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,337
I wanted to blow the
smuggler's face off.

472
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,667
It doesn't sound so pleasant.

473
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,776
Which is why you can understand
how frustrating it is for me...

474
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,207
to hear people say...

475
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,477
that I'm not the self-made type.

476
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,616
Well, you see...

477
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,687
It's my duty to
confirm these facts.

478
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,526
You wish to know my
secret to success.

479
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,826
- Exactly.
- It's nothing big.

480
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,127
Get closer. Come on.

481
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:39,096
I'm sweet...

482
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:43,736
but also deadly.

483
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,196
- How could you let her take it?
- I'm doomed.

484
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,397
Without the necklace,

485
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,337
I can't understand what
animals are saying.

486
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,167
Serves you right for claiming
to be the greatest veterinarian.

487
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:16,906
A deadly thief?

488
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:19,977
There's nothing more pathetic...

489
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,747
than being blinded by
a woman's beauty...

490
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,417
But you also ruined your life by
falling for a beautiful woman.

491
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,647
What?

492
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,917
So what do I do?

493
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,557
What else? You know who
she is, so get it back.

494
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:34,857
I can't.

495
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:36,457
She carries a gun.

496
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:39,026
You're a fox, darn it.
How can a gun scare you?

497
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:42,026
You know I've been traumatized
after being shot in the tail...

498
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:43,526
by a hunter.

499
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,267
Just please get back here soon.

500
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:47,937
Stop whining and get
it back yourself!

501
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:39,486
Why is that branch broken?

502
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:42,486
It must've hurt.

503
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,716
I hope you grow well.

504
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:13,756
The wind is blowing
from the Northwest.

505
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:17,627
Something's coming.

506
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:20,966
Hey, Jae Hwan.

507
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:24,736
You found similar cases?
Who were the victims?

508
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:26,937
All four of them were
unidentified women.

509
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:28,136
When did it happen?

510
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,377
The very first case
occurred in 1954.

511
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:32,636
August 13.

512
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:34,977
In 1954?

513
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:36,946
Since immediately after
the end of the Korean War.

514
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:40,116
Something evil came to the
island riding a typhoon...

515
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,546
Tell me all the dates in order.

516
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,517
August 25, 1961.

517
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,957
September 6, 1979.

518
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:49,526
September 7, 1987.

519
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:51,756
The dates are really far apart,

520
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,457
but this is pretty much
a serial murder case.

521
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:55,296
- Which days of the week?
- I'll tell you in order.

522
00:38:55,526 --> 00:38:58,866
Friday, Friday,
Thursday, and Monday.

523
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,267
It has nothing to
do with the days.

524
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:02,866
Between August and September...

525
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,076
Wait.

526
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,917
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1961</font>

527
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,246
Year 1979...

528
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,217
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1979</font>

529
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,987
Year 1987...

530
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,187
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1987</font>

531
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:18,886
The lunar calendar.

532
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:22,757
They all happened on July 15
based on the lunar calendar.

533
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:25,156
If I'm correct, they all
happened on the same date.

534
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,757
What?

535
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:29,096
And today is that day.

536
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:31,996
Director Nam, you should
get out of that island.

537
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:37,306
What in the world
happened on this island?

538
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:43,676
Excuse me.

539
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:46,987
Weren't you on the boat
with Pyung Hee's father?

540
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:50,487
Two of the survivors
passed away.

541
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:53,826
Your life is in danger.

542
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:55,886
Excuse me!

543
00:39:57,556 --> 00:39:59,196
Please hear me out!

544
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:00,967
Hold on!

545
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,366
Why are you running away?

546
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:10,266
Get lost, you ghost!

547
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:29,687
Don't kill him!

548
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,446
It's not that bad.

549
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,297
- What is that?
- It's a folk remedy.

550
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,567
It's hot.

551
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,467
Gosh, stop being a crybaby.

552
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,237
Your hand is so hot.

553
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:18,576
- It's burning hot.
- What...

554
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:29,487
What's this?

555
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,866
Long time no see, Yeon.

556
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:45,136
Who are you?

557
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:49,007
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

558
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,306
What?

559
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,277
But let me ask you something.

560
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:58,346
Why...

561
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:01,817
did you kill me?

562
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:14,567
Who are you?

563
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:18,437
You should've let me go.

564
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:19,766
What are you?

565
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,176
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended...

566
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:27,806
if you hadn't
stopped the boat...

567
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,076
from crossing the Samdo River.

568
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:40,757
No.

569
00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:44,757
That woman is born with a face
that only I can recognize.

570
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,337
And I don't see it in you.

571
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:01,406
You really...

572
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,877
don't know anything, Yeon.

573
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:18,096
It's hot.

574
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:24,036
What did you do to me?

575
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:25,937
It was really hot.

576
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:29,667
The scar is gone.

577
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:33,777
Who are you?

578
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:35,676
What kind of question is that?

579
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,390
Answer me.

580
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:40,597
- What's with you?
- Who are you?

581
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:47,191
It's me, Ji A. I'm Ji A.

582
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,094
Don't you remember anything?

583
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:54,933
You just...

584
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:04,373
Aren't we too old to play catch?

585
00:44:04,543 --> 00:44:06,404
We hate each other too
much to play catch.

586
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,813
I actually meant to kill you.

587
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:16,683
The photo.

588
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:34,973
Run away.

589
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:37,344
What's going on?
Are you guys dating?

590
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:40,603
Hurry.

591
00:44:57,893 --> 00:44:58,893
Hurry up and run.

592
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,884
- Get out of my way.
- No, just play with me.

593
00:45:23,214 --> 00:45:24,784
This is domestic
violence, you know.

594
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,154
When a child doesn't behave,
it's best to give them a beating.

595
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:29,623
But because I failed to do that,
you ended up becoming a jerk.

596
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,393
You keep blaming it on me...

597
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:33,094
when you were the one who
turned me into an orphan.

598
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:37,263
I should get you a mouth
guard for Christmas this year.

599
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:55,384
Where's my cell phone?

600
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:26,243
Who are you?

601
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:32,353
I've never seen you here before.

602
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:34,924
I came from a broadcasting
station in Seoul.

603
00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:36,924
Do you live here?

604
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,623
Yes.

605
00:46:40,793 --> 00:46:43,293
Which way do I need to go
to go back to the village?

606
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,034
That path over
there is a shortcut.

607
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,404
Thank you.

608
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:50,634
By the way,

609
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:53,603
how long did you live here?

610
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:59,543
A very long time. I've
lived here a lot longer...

611
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:00,884
than what you might imagine.

612
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,754
Then by any chance,
have you ever...

613
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,424
seen these people?

614
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,853
This was taken here
many years ago.

615
00:47:12,723 --> 00:47:16,464
Wait. Wasn't this
woman pregnant?

616
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,203
Yes, she was. Do you remember?

617
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:25,574
Did you talk to them?

618
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:29,444
Why did they come here?

619
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:31,884
Drink before it gets cold.

620
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:38,054
Okay.

621
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:50,694
The baby in her womb
was upside-down,

622
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,163
or the umbilical cord was
wrapped around its neck.

623
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,473
Anyway. They prayed to the
Dragon King in the cave...

624
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:59,473
for an easy labour and delivery.

625
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:00,674
The Dragon King?

626
00:48:00,774 --> 00:48:04,243
He really answers prayers.
Even when Typhoon Sarah hit,

627
00:48:04,513 --> 00:48:06,384
only our island was safe.

628
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:11,083
We used to hold huge rituals
for him back in the day.

629
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:13,853
Like the ritual for a big catch
before fishermen went out?

630
00:48:15,054 --> 00:48:17,094
How does someone so young
know things like that?

631
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:18,763
When was the ritual?

632
00:48:20,123 --> 00:48:21,293
During the Ghost Festival.

633
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:23,734
The Ghost Festival?

634
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,174
That's July 15th on
the lunar calendar.

635
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:34,004
And you performed
the ritual yourself.

636
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,413
This was the only
house on this island...

637
00:48:39,643 --> 00:48:41,353
with a five-coloured flag.

638
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,384
<font color="#00ff00">SYMBOLIZING LIFE, DEATH,
DISEASE, WEALTH, AND ANCESTORS.</font>

639
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:46,583
It means the owner is a shaman.

640
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,853
I do this for a living, you see.

641
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,763
And ma'am.

642
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,594
This pregnant woman in
the photo is a doctor.

643
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:57,333
She would've gone
to the hospital,

644
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,134
not a cave, if something
was wrong with the baby.

645
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:04,274
Sit back down. I'll
tell you everything.

646
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,813
You can tell it to the police.

647
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,444
Look, miss.

648
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:13,344
You can't leave
this place anyway.

649
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:16,353
I didn't drink your tea.

650
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,293
I don't eat or drink
things from strangers.

651
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,163
What's wrong with me?

652
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:47,083
It wasn't the tea,

653
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:50,984
but the incense.

654
00:50:13,404 --> 00:50:14,473
Are you laughing?

655
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:19,583
That was plenty of time.

656
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:22,484
Do you still not get it?

657
00:50:23,214 --> 00:50:25,284
Don't you know why she
ended up on this island?

658
00:50:25,884 --> 00:50:28,154
- What?
- She's going to be a sacrifice.

659
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,123
You don't have much time.

660
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:34,694
Just so you know, she can't
take your call right now.

661
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,234
What happened?

662
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,703
Her scent is completely gone.

663
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,333
The sun will be setting soon.

664
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:21,143
Please hang in there just
a little while longer.

665
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,054
Just like you, your mom...

666
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:41,763
came voluntarily to this island.

667
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:45,703
Ever since she became pregnant,

668
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,734
she had the same
dream every night.

669
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:57,043
You tricked your mom...

670
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:01,043
while you were in her womb.

671
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:20,933
I am the original
mountain spirit,

672
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,603
the master of the
mountains and streams.

673
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:25,674
Lift this darkness
and lead me to her!

674
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,754
Maybe it has been too long.
It isn't working at all.

675
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:54,024
Let's go.

676
00:54:25,324 --> 00:54:26,864
There's no point.

677
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:32,163
It was you.

678
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,973
The bodies of the dead
women found on this island.

679
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:40,944
They were all
precious sacrifices.

680
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:43,513
Give me a break.

681
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,884
Hey, lady. That was just murder.

682
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:51,924
Be a sacrifice.

683
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:54,583
You are a very special child.

684
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,603
You have no idea how
long I've been waiting.

685
00:55:19,013 --> 00:55:22,413
Die. You must die.
You have to die.

686
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:24,413
No.

687
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:51,521
Die. You must die.
You have to die.

688
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:53,791
Halt!

689
00:55:58,302 --> 00:55:59,371
Yeon.

690
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:01,001
Don't touch her.

691
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:02,771
I will tear out your limbs.

692
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:05,342
This has nothing to do with
the old master of the mountain.

693
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:07,204
Why don't you keep walking?

694
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,043
Says the living corpse.

695
00:56:11,514 --> 00:56:12,543
Who was it...

696
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,914
that provided you with
longevity you don't deserve?

697
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:18,784
Tell me who you serve.

698
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:22,483
You can't stop me anyway.

699
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,423
The evening primrose
will keep you out.

700
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:48,744
Die!

701
00:56:57,483 --> 00:56:58,554
Die.

702
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:05,894
Return to the earth.

703
00:58:26,414 --> 00:58:27,574
How dare he!

704
00:58:28,684 --> 00:58:29,744
What is it, my darling?

705
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:34,113
Yeon took a human life.

706
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:19,463
Can you walk?

707
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,764
If you lend me an arm.

708
00:59:42,153 --> 00:59:43,753
What was that woman?

709
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:45,894
A human being.

710
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:48,494
One who wished to live longer.

711
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:52,494
I badly wanted to
clock her in the mouth.

712
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:55,534
So you say. You nearly
died just now, you know.

713
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:57,604
But I didn't.

714
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:33,574
Mr. Lee, I know it was
a desperate situation,

715
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:35,374
but what about the consequences?

716
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:38,443
Just hang up if you're going to nag.
I'll have to receive the punishment.

717
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,713
This is why you should never
get involved with a human girl.

718
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:49,023
This one in particular knows
about A Eum's past life.

719
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,724
What? The director lady?

720
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,653
I don't know what she is, but
I'll be keeping my eye on her.

721
01:00:54,523 --> 01:00:57,293
Your love story is more
than just famous among us.

722
01:00:57,463 --> 01:00:59,264
It's probably your
brother playing tricks.

723
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:01,463
The fruit corner will
begin its closing sale.

724
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:02,934
A special discount price.

725
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:04,563
It'll never be this price again.

726
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:06,334
Where are you? The supermarket?

727
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:09,325
<font color="#00ff00">SPECIAL DISCOUNT,
NECTARINE, 2.152 DOLLARS</font>

728
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,144
I needed a pick-me-up
after what had happened...

729
01:01:13,414 --> 01:01:15,483
and this is my
very own paradise.

730
01:01:15,644 --> 01:01:17,144
Did you take my
credit card again?

731
01:01:17,184 --> 01:01:21,014
Hello? Mr. Lee? You're
breaking up. Mr. Lee!

732
01:01:24,554 --> 01:01:25,693
Is this organic?

733
01:01:31,463 --> 01:01:32,534
Alcohol?

734
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:34,293
I'm too much of a human...

735
01:01:34,293 --> 01:01:35,903
to easily fall asleep
after such an event.

736
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:37,863
Join me.

737
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:45,043
I never said anything since it
could make me seem old-fashioned,

738
01:01:45,644 --> 01:01:48,374
but you're too informal with me
when you don't even know my age.

739
01:01:48,644 --> 01:01:51,784
Those over 60 are universally
considered as grandpas.

740
01:01:55,423 --> 01:01:56,454
Be as informal as you like.

741
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:05,434
Why do you keep saving me?

742
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:10,463
3.5 million deaths
don't faze you at all,

743
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:12,374
so why?

744
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:22,014
Do I have something...

745
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:24,883
that you're looking for?

746
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:41,733
I have countless
questions on my mind,

747
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,264
but I'll leave them be for now.

748
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:45,604
I'll say this though.

749
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:48,843
Thanks, Yeon.

750
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:53,974
The 9-year-old me and
the 30-year-old me...

751
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:56,813
both lived thanks to you.

752
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:00,213
You see,

753
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:04,923
I may not be able to kick
butt and control the weather,

754
01:03:06,394 --> 01:03:09,664
but I'll return
the favour someday.

755
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:15,334
You can count on
me to protect you.

756
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:38,354
Do you perhaps
have the ability...

757
01:03:38,354 --> 01:03:41,023
to duplicate this
bottle of soju?

758
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,093
Like the Miracle of
the Loaves and Fishes?

759
01:03:45,093 --> 01:03:46,164
Yes.

760
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:48,664
I'm not Jesus, you know.
Just drink what you have.

761
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:22,023
Are you leaving on
the first boat out?

762
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:25,363
I see you're limping.

763
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:30,604
You sacrificed your leg
to avenge your father.

764
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:33,104
How did you...

765
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:35,133
You were lucky enough to
live to tell the tale.

766
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:37,974
Don't ever resort to
cursing people again.

767
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:41,874
Karma can sting.

768
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:48,724
It's empty.

769
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:51,324
- What?
- Everyone's gone.

770
01:05:51,483 --> 01:05:52,593
What do mean?

771
01:05:52,844 --> 01:05:56,214
It's as if the entire
village vanished.

772
01:05:57,016 --> 01:05:58,447
Not even a human
shadow is in sight.

773
01:07:10,803 --> 01:07:13,763
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

774
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:17,704

evil spirits come and go.</i>

775
01:07:18,504 --> 01:07:21,113
<i>How dare you! What
were you thinking?</i>

776
01:07:22,214 --> 01:07:24,113
<i>Why do you hate your
older brother so much?</i>

777

<i>If you want to live,</i>

778
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:28,683
<i>you'd better not
fall asleep tonight.</i>

779
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:34,454

01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:37,464

a long life this time either.</i>

I'll be able to leave today.</i>

be able to leave.</i>
