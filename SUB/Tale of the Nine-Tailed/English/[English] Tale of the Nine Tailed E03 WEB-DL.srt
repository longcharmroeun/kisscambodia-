00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:28,675
It's hot.

2
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:30,545
Gosh, stop being a crybaby.

3
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,414
Your hand is so hot.

4
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:34,185
It's burning hot.

5
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:44,695
Long time no see, Yeon.

6
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:53,975
Thirsty...

15
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:39,105
Being at sea wasn't enough and
he drowned himself to death.

16
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,004
He drowned?

17
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:42,874
In that toilet?

18
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,944
I fished his head out myself.

19
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,675
Look at how bloated
his stomach is.

20
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,744
That's all due to him
chugging down water.

21
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:56,284
Please call the police, Captain,
and close off this restroom.

22
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,425
Talk about it being
all for nothing.

23
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,724
This is what he gets after
throwing himself at his life.

24
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,964
What do you mean by that?

25
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:08,534
He was on The Galaxy,
the fishing boat...

26
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,205
that flipped over.

27
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:14,274
Then he was on that boat
with Pyung Hee's father.

28
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,805
Yes, there were four
of them in total.

29
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,744
Is this the police?

30
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:25,485
I see someone threw a party.

31
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,124
- What's wrong?
- It stinks.

32
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:33,594
What do you mean?

33
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,555
He smells like a stinky fish.

34
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,194
The body hasn't had time
to decompose yet though.

35
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:52,504
Hair?

36
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,244
But his is Gray.

37
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:59,115
I smell the sea...

38
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,024
and a faint scent of the
duvet from that house.

39
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:08,224
That house? You mean,
Pyung Hee's house?

43
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,574
That man. It's the same guy.

44
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,574
Four men were on board
The Galaxy that sunk.

45
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,285
Three returned
home in one piece,

46
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,814
- but one...
- Only his head came back to shore.

47

Please let me see my dad!

Dad!

49
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,124
By the looks of it,
he won't be the last.

50
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,124
Are you saying more
people could die?

51
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,465
Then we should get going.

52
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:23,465
Why?

53
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:24,805
To stop it, of course.

54
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,704
- I don't want to.
- What?

55
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,305
It's not my job.

56
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:30,244
Besides, they're not
good looking enough.

57
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,305
Come on!

58
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,175

- Come on. We've met before.

73
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:35,865
This house is a mess.

74
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,405
I heard you were with the guy
who lost his head that day.

75
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,874
Get out of my house. Get lost.

76
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,374
I'll leave when I want to.

77
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,874
You punk.

78
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,874
You need to learn how to behave.

79
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,454
I want you to answer
my questions politely.

80
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:56,084
If you don't, I'll start breaking
each one of your fingers.

81
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,485
What happened on the boat?

82
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,525
We met an unexpected
storm that day.

83
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,665
The weather forecast was wrong.

84
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:06,095
Then why did only
three of you survive?

85
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,334
Mr. Seo got swept
away by the waves.

86
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,865
And we were lost out in the sea.

87
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,634
- And then?
- That's all I remember.

88
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,235
I swear!

89
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:19,475
- When I woke up, I was onshore.
- Okay. I'll start with your pinkie.

90
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,574
Wait.

91
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:26,715
I bet you were scared.

92
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:31,454
You spent 28 days on that lifeboat
without any food or water.

93
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,555
It's just the right condition
for you to lose your mind.

94
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:38,765
The strong sunlight would've
caused your skin to burn.

95
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:42,464
And even with an empty stomach, I
bet you were constantly seasick.

96
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:45,464
You were probably sick of waiting
for someone to come save you,

97
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,974
and I bet you got angry the
more you thought about it.

98
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:48,474
"Why me? Why?"

99
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:49,574
Shut it!

100
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,805
The fifth day was
probably the worst...

101
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,844
because it hadn't rained at all.

102
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:57,145
First, you would've
gotten dehydrated.

103
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:03,425
Please help us.

104
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,334
Are you crazy?

105
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,135
Are you trying to die?

106
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,645
We're all going to die anyway.

107
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,545
I don't want to die.

108
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,915
- I don't want to die.
- My goodness.

109
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:32,984
I'm thirsty.

110
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,484

is worried sick.

I'm hungry.

114
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,275
I'm hungry.

115
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,145
I'm hungry.

116
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,145
But it's strange.

117
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:06,245
You say you starved for 28 days,
but you didn't lose much weight.

118
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:10,324
You didn't have Wi-Fi, so you
couldn't have ordered delivery food.

119
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,454
- What did you eat?
- Stop!

120
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,224
I... I didn't do it.

121
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,864
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

122
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,175
I...

123
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:31,444
refuse to die out here.

124
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,844
What's the matter with you
guys? What are you doing?

125
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:35,974
Don't do this. Please.

126
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:38,645
I'm not going to die!

127
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,755
It wasn't me.

I'm starving.

130
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,135
It's meat.

131
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,675
It's meat. I see meat.

132
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:05,805
It's meat.

00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,084

134
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,055
Meat. My meat.

135
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:20,755
Give me my...

136
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,635
Hey, wake up.

137
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:36,375

138
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:42,344
Is this hair?

139
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,084

No, I mean, don't

No.

I was watering the

00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,594
Wait here for a moment.

166
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,864
Oh, I almost forgot.

167
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,844
I wonder what kind of
trouble is waiting to happen.

168
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,675
I've seen lots of paintings...

169
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,175
as I gathered information
for my TV show.

170
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:29,974
But I've never seen a painting
that gives me the chills like this.

171
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,145
I wonder why.

172
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:40,395
There's something
missing in this drawing.

173
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,014
<font color="#00ff00">THE PAINTING OF
THE DRAGON KING</font>

174
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,834
You startled me.

175
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:54,275
Oh, sorry.

176
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,305
Do you seriously have an
appetite for that right now?

177
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:58,405
Why? It's my favourite snack.

178
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,844
Two people died.

179
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,245
So what?

180
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:04,844
Why can't you give me a
more reasonable reaction?

181
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,854
Do you know how many
people in Joseon died...

182
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:10,984
during the 50 years of war?

183
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,155
3.5 million.

184
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,625
I've seen more deaths...

185
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,194
than all the funeral
companies in this country.

186
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:18,995
I'm sure there was
at least one death...

187
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,564
that made your heart ache
among those 3.5 million people.

188
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,795
Take a look at this.

189
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:53,665
The same painting was also
in that house earlier.

190
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,395
Isn't this a portrait
of the Dragon King?

191
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,464
Yes, but it looks
nothing like him.

192
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,005
- You saw him?
- Back when I was a mountain spirit.

193
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,405
We were in the same
leadership program.

194
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,875
People glamorized him too much.
He's not this good-looking.

195
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:14,354
This painting is a little different
from the ones I've seen before.

196
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,454
Look. This is the
usual painting.

197
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:21,125
Do you notice what's different?

198
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,255
This is just like
"Where's Wally?"

199
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,434
This has no feet.

200
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:35,574
Feet?

201
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,444
You're right.

202
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,045
A dragon that has no feet.
Do you get what this is?

203
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,245
This isn't a dragon.
It's a snake.

204
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:48,515
It's an Imoogi.

205
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,824
Are you Lee Rang?

206
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,164
I've been waiting.

207
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:35,594
Is that really asleep in here?

208
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:38,634
Yes. The spirit of immorality.

209
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,235
The king of the corrupt.

210
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,505
Lee Ryong.

211
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:44,604
Oh, my goodness.

212
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,674
That was so cringy.

213
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:49,445
Adding a title from the afterlife
in front of their name...

214
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:51,045
doesn't change who they were.

215
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:57,285
He died while facing
off against Yeon, right?

216
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:58,725
Along with that human woman.

217
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,725
Prior to entering
the wench's body,

218
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,765
he entrusted our family of
shamans a portion of his body.

219
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,195
I guess he never goes all in.

220
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:10,965
He's the opposite of me.

221
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:14,805
Anyway, are you ready?

222
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,245
A woman born in the year of
the sheep. A living sacrifice.

223
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,604
- And...
- Leave Yeon to me.

224
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,874
Go to the cemetery and pick
some evening primroses...

225
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,285
that grew on the flesh
and blood of corpses.

226
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:29,314
Let me ask you something.

227
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:37,624
Are you not brothers
with Lee Yeon?

228
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:40,295
We are brothers.

229
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,634
Half-brothers, to be exact.

230
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,834
If he awakes,

231
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,475
Lee Yeon will not survive.

232
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:53,305
- So?
- Why are you...

233
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:55,144
aiding your brother's enemy?

234
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:02,814
Come here.

235
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,225
- What is it?
- Pack your things and leave.

236
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,094
As soon as possible. Leave
this wretched island.

237
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:10,424
What?

238
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,564
I have a bad feeling about this.

239
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:13,265
What do you mean?

240
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,894
I'm saying you may
die if you stay here.

241
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,435
You said you weren't here to save
anyone. Why am I an exception?

242
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,104
That's none of your business.

243
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:29,614
I won't go home for a
reason I don't know.

244
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:33,015
So you can find the
person you came to meet.

245
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,414
I need to find out why
my mom and dad came here.

246
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,364
Why am I aiding the enemy
of my own blood relative?

247
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,164
It's a good practice not to fully
trust your business partner.

248
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,364
That's not what I meant.

249
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,374
Did you see Yeon while
he was a mountain spirit?

250
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,134
I heard about him
only through rumours.

251
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,475
What was the rumour?

252
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:03,245
The most merciless of the four
mountain spirits that rule the land.

253
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:07,255
No one could dare
exploit his woods,

254
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:10,824
and thus the Baekdudaegan
Mountain Range was always lush.

255
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:15,195
My brother was a mountain
spirit in name only.

256
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:18,094
He had no sense of altruism.

257
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,795
But you know,

258
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,164
even when we shared an apple,

259
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:26,265
he always gave me
the bigger half.

260
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:31,144
I still remember how
sweet that apple tasted.

261
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,545
Then why...

262
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,574
He used that tender hand with
which he sliced the apple...

263
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:39,015
to slice my stomach.

264
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:44,884
Obviously, it scarred me emotionally
much more than it did physically.

265
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,555
- Is that why...
- I'm a fox after all.

266
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,624
I need to return the favour.

267
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,435
I'm determined to go
to the Underworld...

268
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,305
together with Yeon.

269
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:20,084
Ms. Nam, I came to the
library as you asked.

270
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,795
But what am I looking
for? Dead bodies?

271
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,834
So... You mean chopped
up bodies, right?

272
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,604
Run a search for "Eohwa Island" and
find every incident or accident.

273
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,634
Call me if you find anything.

274
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:34,935
What are you looking for?

275
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:37,205
I'm bothered by something
the old ladies here said.

276
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:39,904
You can't tell anyone...
that you heard it from us.

277
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,614
This isn't the first time.

278
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:43,674
The human head...

279
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:49,515
Granny.

280
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,525
Did you hear anything about
that punk from before?

281
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:54,894
What punk?

282
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:57,465
Imoogi.

283
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,364
Didn't you...

284
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,364
end his life with
your own hands?

285
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,634
- I did.
- Then?

286
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:09,235
Just because. I'm just worried.

287
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,275
If by chance A Eum was
born again into this world,

288
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:16,015
I can't let that thing
coexist with her.

289
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,314
Such devotion.

290
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,255
- How would I not know if that...
- Okay, bye.

291
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,755
Look at this rude punk.

292
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:45,475
- Hi, Pyung Hee.
- Hello.

293
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:48,015
What are you reading?

294
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:58,354
What's wrong?

295
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:00,584
You're not Pyung Hee, are you?

296
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,495
How are you...

297
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,505
This is the best place to read.

298
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,604
Anyway. You're all alone.

299
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,144
He's nearby.

300
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:23,614
No, he isn't.

301
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,584
I can smell him
better than anyone.

302
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,217
Anyway. You're all alone.

303
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,416
He's nearby.

304
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,126
No, he isn't.

305
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,787
I can smell him
better than anyone.

306
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,037
You're the one who
killed the fishermen.

307
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:55,636
You shouldn't go around accusing
people. Do you have proof?

308
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,977
That book.

309
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:01,876
This? I like the classics.

310
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,386
"Moby Dick" is a novel
based on true events.

311
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,247
A whaling ship that sank
in the 19th century.

312
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,586
What happened to it?

313
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:11,487
It ate and was eaten.

314
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:14,126
Just like Pyung Hee's father.

315
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:18,896
Oh, my gosh. You scared
me half to death.

316
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,237
Look at this.

317
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,336
It's here too.

318
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,267
What are you doing?

319
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:32,047
I'll ask the questions.

320
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:34,047
I asked, what are you doing?

321
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,447
I said only I ask the questions.

322
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:44,987
If you don't answer my questions,
you'll never cast a net again.

323
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,626
Explain this painting.

324
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:52,467
But you know, if I were the
killer, I'd need a motive.

325
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,767
What was my motive? For justice?

326
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:58,737
I wasn't sure until a
moment ago, but I am now.

327
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,376
The fishermen's deaths
are like a fireworks show.

328
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:06,346
A fireworks show.

329
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,777
You're drawing attention
with outrageous incidents...

330
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:11,447
to distract us.
That's your motive.

331
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,146
- Why?
- Probably...

332
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:16,416
to hide the real reason
you're on this island.

333
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:24,767
Awesome. You're quite
smart for a human woman.

334
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,326
Since you got the answer right,

335
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,737
I should reward you.

336
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,507
You're looking for
your parents, right?

337
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,336
- Give me that.
- Why?

338
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:35,876
You saw them in your dream.

339
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,307
How do you know?

340
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:41,816
Just say the word.

341
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,386
Who knows?

342
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,916
I may have the answer.

343
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:53,287
Can you really find them?

344
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:56,856
That's right. Should
I grant you...

345
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:58,967
that wish?

346
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:09,406
I asked what this painting was.

347
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,247
It... It's the Dragon King.

348
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:15,346
He calms the storms...

349
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,346
and sends fish to fishermen.

350
00:26:17,477 --> 00:26:20,146
There are big
rituals for him too.

351
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,687
- Liar.
- Fishing isn't like farming.

352
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:24,787
It isn't within human control.

353
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:28,856
- I'll just cut it.
- I'm telling the truth!

354
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,666
Where did you get this painting?

355
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,537
One of the village ladies
bought them from mainland...

356
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:36,037
for each and every household.

357
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,207
Just ask anyone!

358
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,777
Forget everything you just saw.

359
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,126
- How much is it?
- Goodness. When did you get here?

360
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:00,527
That'll be a dollar.

361
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:05,626
How many of you came as
part of the production team?

362
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,166
A pretty boy came by and
asked for directions...

363
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:11,066
to Pyung Hee's house.

364
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:14,537
Pretty boy?

365
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,747
I only need to hear one word.

366
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,047
"Yes."

367
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:37,656
I decline.

368
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:40,767
Why is that?

369
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,497
Foxes never stay in debt, right?

370
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:47,906
In other words, you
always collect on favours.

371
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,106
Loosen up, will you?

372
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:51,646
Why be so stiff when
it's just good old me?

373
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:54,146
Let me give you some advice
since that's how you feel.

374
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:58,116
Don't gamble with another's
tragedy just for kicks.

375
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:01,987
There's a word for people
like you, you know.

376
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,886
A colossal jerk.

377
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:09,826
You have no idea how much
I hate vulgar speech.

378
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,926
Call me that again
and I'll kill you.

379
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,237
Why me? Why are
you messing with...

380
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,366
I'm done talking to you.

381
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,237
Here's some advice in return.

382
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:26,707
Don't put too much
trust in Lee Yeon.

383
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,547
What do you mean?

384
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:34,386
When he finds what he wants,
you'll be begging for mercy.

385
00:28:58,247 --> 00:28:59,346
He left.

386
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,646
You're still in one piece.

387
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:04,717
What did he say?

388
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:08,457
He said he could find
my parents for me.

389
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:10,787
And?

390
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:15,797
Even when I order pizza, I
never go for a half-and-half.

391
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,527
I always choose just one.

392
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:20,297
What are you getting at?

393
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:21,866
I turned him down...

394
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:26,037
because you're the
fox I'm betting on.

395
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:31,106
Smart lady.

396
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:33,606
Is that all?

397
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,316
Don't put too much
trust in Lee Yeon.

398
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:38,586
Yes, that's all.

399
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:40,116
Well, I'm famished.

400
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:43,287
How about you take your own
advice and leave the island?

401
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:46,787
- What?
- Your brother.

402
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:50,227
He's cooking up
some sort of event.

403
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:51,426
And that's what I'm waiting for.

404
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:15,217
Seriously?

405
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,156
Not a familiar face, right?

406
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,057
She's not domestic.

407
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,626
- Then?
- She's probably from abroad.

408
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,896
That explains her
sophisticated look.

409
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,537
How much in jewellery
is she wearing?

410
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,336
Who booked the table?

411
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:39,547
Ki Yu Ri. She's the director
of Moze Department Store.

412
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,376
She doesn't seem like
a self-made woman.

413
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,176
Maybe she won the lottery.

414
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:46,217
Foxes who reek of
money and power...

415
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:47,957
fall into one of
these two categories.

416
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:50,356
They either come from a prestigious
bloodline like Mr. Lee Yeon...

417
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:54,057
or they broke taboo
and stole a human life.

418
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,406
Sitting here like this
makes me wonder...

419
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,517
if all that happened
this morning was a dream.

420
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:22,217
If only life could be just
as uneventful every day.

421
00:31:23,156 --> 00:31:24,457
Then settle in the countryside.

422
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:28,396
Don't you miss the nature?

423
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:30,957
Not really. There aren't
any department stores.

424
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:32,826
Also, I can't live
without black coffee...

425
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:34,396
and mint chocolate
ice cream anymore.

426
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,197
Some fox you are.

427
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:40,507
Life's the same for everyone.

428
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:43,076
Just because these ladies wear
baggy pants in floral prints...

429
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:44,846
doesn't mean they
have kind hearts.

430
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:48,846
Get digging, and you'll find
all sorts of dirty secrets.

431
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:53,687
Is that the case for you too?

432
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:58,356
I'm just curious as to
how your life has been...

433
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:00,457
for all those centuries.

434
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,896
What about you then?

435
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:09,497
Why have you been searching
for your parents all this time?

436
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,066
It's simple.

437
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,477
I miss them, that's all.
I miss my mom and dad.

438
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,316
Same here.

439
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,487
I'm waiting for the one I miss.

440
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,457
Your first love? Was it human...

441
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,027
or a fox?

442
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:39,497
Why did you part ways when
you still miss her this much?

443
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,106
I see you won't tell me.

444
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:52,207
The first being I loved was a
human girl who ended up dying.

445
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:55,524
It's why I'm still hung
up on her. Happy now?

446
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,419
But you said you're
waiting for her.

447
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:02,803
You're waiting for
someone who's dead?

448
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:08,904
She promised...

449
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,035
to be reborn.

450
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,466
Here. Clean up for me too.

451
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:45,196
Only the staff can enter.

452
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,136
Gosh, my bad.

453
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:52,937
I don't think it was a mistake.

454
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,576
Do I look like someone who
resorts to petty theft?

455
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,046
How about we exchange names?

456
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,946
We are of the same
species, after all.

457
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:02,817
I'm Yu Ri.

458
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,346
Technically, we're
not the same species.

459
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:08,787
I take it you're from Russia.

460
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,986
- Sharp, aren't you?
- How did you come to Korea?

461
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,457
- Were you...
- Yes, I was smuggled.

462
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:19,026
Have you been on a
nine-hour flight...

463
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:20,897
squeezed between
Makarov pistols before?

464
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,236
The moment we landed,

465
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:25,337
I wanted to blow the
smuggler's face off.

466
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:27,667
It doesn't sound so pleasant.

467
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:30,776
Which is why you can understand
how frustrating it is for me...

468
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,207
to hear people say...

469
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:35,477
that I'm not the self-made type.

470
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,616
Well, you see...

471
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,687
It's my duty to
confirm these facts.

472
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:46,526
You wish to know my
secret to success.

473
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,826
- Exactly.
- It's nothing big.

474
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:53,127
Get closer. Come on.

475
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,096
I'm sweet...

476
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,736
but also deadly.

477
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,196
- How could you let her take it?
- I'm doomed.

478
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,397
Without the necklace,

479
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:28,337
I can't understand what
animals are saying.

480
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,167
Serves you right for claiming
to be the greatest veterinarian.

481
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:34,906
A deadly thief?

482
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,977
There's nothing more pathetic...

483
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,747
than being blinded by
a woman's beauty...

484
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:44,417
But you also ruined your life by
falling for a beautiful woman.

485
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,647
What?

486
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,917
So what do I do?

487
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,557
What else? You know who
she is, so get it back.

488
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:52,857
I can't.

489
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:54,457
She carries a gun.

490
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:57,026
You're a fox, darn it.
How can a gun scare you?

491
00:35:57,026 --> 00:36:00,026
You know I've been traumatized
after being shot in the tail...

492
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:01,526
by a hunter.

493
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:04,267
Just please get back here soon.

494
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,937
Stop whining and get
it back yourself!

495
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:57,486
Why is that branch broken?

496
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,486
It must've hurt.

497
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:25,716
I hope you grow well.

498
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,756
The wind is blowing
from the Northwest.

499
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,627
Something's coming.

500
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:38,966
Hey, Jae Hwan.

501
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:42,736
You found similar cases?
Who were the victims?

502
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,937
All four of them were
unidentified women.

503
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:46,136
When did it happen?

504
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:49,377
The very first case
occurred in 1954.

505
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:50,636
August 13.

506
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,977
In 1954?

507
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,946
Since immediately after
the end of the Korean War.

508
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:58,116
Something evil came to the
island riding a typhoon...

509
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,546
Tell me all the dates in order.

510
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:02,517
August 25, 1961.

511
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,957
September 6, 1979.

512
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:07,526
September 7, 1987.

513
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:09,756
The dates are really far apart,

514
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,457
but this is pretty much
a serial murder case.

515
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:13,296
- Which days of the week?
- I'll tell you in order.

516
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,866
Friday, Friday,
Thursday, and Monday.

517
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:18,267
It has nothing to
do with the days.

518
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,866
Between August and September...

519
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,176
Wait.

520
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,017
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1961</font>

521
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,346
Year 1979...

522
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,317
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1979</font>

523
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:34,087
Year 1987...

524
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,287
<font color="#00ff00">LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1987</font>

525
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:36,986
The lunar calendar.

526
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,857
They all happened on July 15
based on the lunar calendar.

527
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:43,256
If I'm correct, they all
happened on the same date.

528
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:44,857
What?

529
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,196
And today is that day.

530
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:50,096
Director Nam, you should
get out of that island.

531
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:55,406
What in the world
happened on this island?

532
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:01,776
Excuse me.

533
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:05,087
Weren't you on the boat
with Pyung Hee's father?

534
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:08,587
Two of the survivors
passed away.

535
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:11,926
Your life is in danger.

536
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:13,986
Excuse me!

537
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:17,296
Please hear me out!

538
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,067
Hold on!

539
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,466
Why are you running away?

540
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,366
Get lost, you ghost!

541
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:47,787
Don't kill him!

542
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,546
It's not that bad.

543
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:22,397
- What is that?
- It's a folk remedy.

544
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:29,667
It's hot.

545
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:31,567
Gosh, stop being a crybaby.

546
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,337
Your hand is so hot.

547
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:36,676
- It's burning hot.
- What...

548
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:47,587
What's this?

549
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:00,966
Long time no see, Yeon.

550
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:03,236
Who are you?

551
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,107
It's me. The person
you've been waiting for.

552
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:09,406
What?

553
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:13,377
But let me ask you something.

554
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:16,446
Why...

555
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:19,917
did you kill me?

556
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:32,667
Who are you?

557
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:36,537
You should've let me go.

558
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:37,866
What are you?

559
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:43,276
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended...

560
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,906
if you hadn't
stopped the boat...

561
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:49,176
from crossing the Samdo River.

562
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:58,857
No.

563
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:02,857
That woman is born with a face
that only I can recognize.

564
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:13,437
And I don't see it in you.

565
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:19,506
You really...

566
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,977
don't know anything, Yeon.

567
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,196
It's hot.

568
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:42,136
What did you do to me?

569
00:42:42,497 --> 00:42:44,037
It was really hot.

570
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,767
The scar is gone.

571
00:42:50,837 --> 00:42:51,877
Who are you?

572
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:53,776
What kind of question is that?

573
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:55,584
Answer me.

574
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:58,783
- What's with you?
- Who are you?

575
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:05,354
It's me, Ji A. I'm Ji A.

576
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:10,294
Don't you remember anything?

577
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:13,133
You just...

578
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,573
Aren't we too old to play catch?

579
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:24,604
We hate each other too
much to play catch.

580
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:27,013
I actually meant to kill you.

581
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:34,883
The photo.

582
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,173
Run away.

583
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,544
What's going on?
Are you guys dating?

584
00:43:57,644 --> 00:43:58,803
Hurry.

585
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,093
Hurry up and run.

586
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:41,084
- Get out of my way.
- No, just play with me.

587
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:42,984
This is domestic
violence, you know.

588
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:45,354
When a child doesn't behave,
it's best to give them a beating.

589
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:47,823
But because I failed to do that,
you ended up becoming a jerk.

590
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,593
You keep blaming it on me...

591
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,294
when you were the one who
turned me into an orphan.

592
00:44:52,263 --> 00:44:55,463
I should get you a mouth
guard for Christmas this year.

593
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:13,584
Where's my cell phone?

594
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:44,443
Who are you?

595
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:50,553
I've never seen you here before.

596
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:53,124
I came from a broadcasting
station in Seoul.

597
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,124
Do you live here?

598
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:57,823
Yes.

599
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:01,493
Which way do I need to go
to go back to the village?

600
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:05,234
That path over
there is a shortcut.

601
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:06,604
Thank you.

602
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:08,834
By the way,

603
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:11,803
how long did you live here?

604
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:17,743
A very long time. I've
lived here a lot longer...

605
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:19,084
than what you might imagine.

606
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:21,954
Then by any chance,
have you ever...

607
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:23,624
seen these people?

608
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:26,053
This was taken here
many years ago.

609
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:34,664
Wait. Wasn't this
woman pregnant?

610
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:38,403
Yes, she was. Do you remember?

611
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:43,774
Did you talk to them?

612
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:47,644
Why did they come here?

613
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:50,084
Drink before it gets cold.

614
00:46:55,184 --> 00:46:56,254
Okay.

615
00:47:05,493 --> 00:47:08,894
The baby in her womb
was upside-down,

616
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:11,363
or the umbilical cord was
wrapped around its neck.

617
00:47:12,004 --> 00:47:14,673
Anyway. They prayed to the
Dragon King in the cave...

618
00:47:15,004 --> 00:47:17,673
for an easy labour and delivery.

619
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:18,874
The Dragon King?

620
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:22,443
He really answers prayers.
Even when Typhoon Sarah hit,

621
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:24,584
only our island was safe.

622
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:29,283
We used to hold huge rituals
for him back in the day.

623
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,053
Like the ritual for a big catch
before fishermen went out?

624
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:35,294
How does someone so young
know things like that?

625
00:47:35,624 --> 00:47:36,963
When was the ritual?

626
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:39,493
During the Ghost Festival.

627
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:41,934
The Ghost Festival?

628
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:47,374
That's July 15th on
the lunar calendar.

629
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:52,204
And you performed
the ritual yourself.

630
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,613
This was the only
house on this island...

631
00:47:57,843 --> 00:47:59,553
with a five-coloured flag.

632
00:47:59,553 --> 00:48:01,584
<font color="#00ff00">SYMBOLIZING LIFE, DEATH,
DISEASE, WEALTH, AND ANCESTORS.</font>

633
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,783
It means the owner is a shaman.

634
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:08,053
I do this for a living, you see.

635
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:09,963
And ma'am.

636
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:13,794
This pregnant woman in
the photo is a doctor.

637
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,533
She would've gone
to the hospital,

638
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,334
not a cave, if something
was wrong with the baby.

639
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:22,474
Sit back down. I'll
tell you everything.

640
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,013
You can tell it to the police.

641
00:48:28,314 --> 00:48:29,644
Look, miss.

642
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:31,544
You can't leave
this place anyway.

643
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:34,553
I didn't drink your tea.

644
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:43,493
I don't eat or drink
things from strangers.

645
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:52,363
What's wrong with me?

646
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:05,283
It wasn't the tea,

647
00:49:08,084 --> 00:49:09,184
but the incense.

648
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:32,673
Are you laughing?

649
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:37,783
That was plenty of time.

650
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:40,684
Do you still not get it?

651
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:43,484
Don't you know why she
ended up on this island?

652
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,354
- What?
- She's going to be a sacrifice.

653
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,323
You don't have much time.

654
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:52,894
Just so you know, she can't
take your call right now.

655
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,434
What happened?

656
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:03,903
Her scent is completely gone.

657
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:35,533
The sun will be setting soon.

658
00:50:36,573 --> 00:50:39,343
Please hang in there just
a little while longer.

659
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:55,254
Just like you, your mom...

660
00:50:57,593 --> 00:50:59,963
came voluntarily to this island.

661
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:03,903
Ever since she became pregnant,

662
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,934
she had the same
dream every night.

663
00:51:13,443 --> 00:51:15,243
You tricked your mom...

664
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:19,243
while you were in her womb.

665
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,133
I am the original
mountain spirit,

666
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:40,803
the master of the
mountains and streams.

667
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:43,874
Lift this darkness
and lead me to her!

668
00:51:59,124 --> 00:52:01,954
Maybe it has been too long.
It isn't working at all.

669
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:12,224
Let's go.

670
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,064
There's no point.

671
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:50,363
It was you.

672
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:53,173
The bodies of the dead
women found on this island.

673
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:59,144
They were all
precious sacrifices.

674
00:54:00,343 --> 00:54:01,713
Give me a break.

675
00:54:01,914 --> 00:54:05,084
Hey, lady. That was just murder.

676
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:10,124
Be a sacrifice.

677
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:12,783
You are a very special child.

678
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,803
You have no idea how
long I've been waiting.

679
00:54:37,213 --> 00:54:40,613
Die. You must die.
You have to die.

680
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:42,613
No.

681
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:09,721
Die. You must die.
You have to die.

682
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:11,991
Halt!

683
00:55:16,502 --> 00:55:17,571
Yeon.

684
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,201
Don't touch her.

685
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:20,971
I will tear out your limbs.

686
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:23,542
This has nothing to do with
the old master of the mountain.

687
00:55:23,804 --> 00:55:25,404
Why don't you keep walking?

688
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:28,243
Says the living corpse.

689
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:30,743
Who was it...

690
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:33,114
that provided you with
longevity you don't deserve?

691
00:55:35,243 --> 00:55:36,984
Tell me who you serve.

692
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:40,683
You can't stop me anyway.

693
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,623
The evening primrose
will keep you out.

694
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:06,944
Die!

695
00:56:15,683 --> 00:56:16,754
Die.

696
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,094
Return to the earth.

697
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:45,774
How dare he!

698
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:47,944
What is it, my darling?

699
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:52,313
Yeon took a human life.

700
00:58:36,594 --> 00:58:37,663
Can you walk?

701
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:41,964
If you lend me an arm.

702
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:01,953
What was that woman?

703
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:04,094
A human being.

704
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:06,694
One who wished to live longer.

705
00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:10,694
I badly wanted to
clock her in the mouth.

706
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,734
So you say. You nearly
died just now, you know.

707
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:15,804
But I didn't.

708
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:51,774
Mr. Lee, I know it was
a desperate situation,

709
00:59:52,103 --> 00:59:53,574
but what about the consequences?

710
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:56,643
Just hang up if you're going to nag.
I'll have to receive the punishment.

711
00:59:57,043 --> 00:59:59,913
This is why you should never
get involved with a human girl.

712
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:07,223
This one in particular knows
about A Eum's past life.

713
01:00:07,223 --> 01:00:08,924
What? The director lady?

714
01:00:09,223 --> 01:00:11,853
I don't know what she is, but
I'll be keeping my eye on her.

715
01:00:12,723 --> 01:00:15,493
Your love story is more
than just famous among us.

716
01:00:15,663 --> 01:00:17,464
It's probably your
brother playing tricks.

717
01:00:17,464 --> 01:00:19,663
The fruit corner will
begin its closing sale.

718
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:21,134
A special discount price.

719
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,763
It'll never be this price again.

720
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:24,534
Where are you? The supermarket?

721
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:27,525
<font color="#00ff00">SPECIAL DISCOUNT,
NECTARINE, 2.152 DOLLARS</font>

722
01:00:29,243 --> 01:00:31,344
I needed a pick-me-up
after what had happened...

723
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:33,683
and this is my
very own paradise.

724
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:35,344
Did you take my
credit card again?

725
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:39,214
Hello? Mr. Lee? You're
breaking up. Mr. Lee!

726
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:43,893
Is this organic?

727
01:00:49,663 --> 01:00:50,734
Alcohol?

728
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,493
I'm too much of a human...

729
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,103
to easily fall asleep
after such an event.

730
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:56,063
Join me.

731
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:03,243
I never said anything since it
could make me seem old-fashioned,

732
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:06,574
but you're too informal with me
when you don't even know my age.

733
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:09,984
Those over 60 are universally
considered as grandpas.

734
01:01:13,623 --> 01:01:14,654
Be as informal as you like.

735
01:01:21,964 --> 01:01:23,634
Why do you keep saving me?

736
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:28,663
3.5 million deaths
don't faze you at all,

737
01:01:29,404 --> 01:01:30,574
so why?

738
01:01:38,813 --> 01:01:40,214
Do I have something...

739
01:01:41,183 --> 01:01:43,083
that you're looking for?

740
01:01:58,393 --> 01:01:59,933
I have countless
questions on my mind,

741
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:01,464
but I'll leave them be for now.

742
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:03,804
I'll say this though.

743
01:02:05,774 --> 01:02:07,043
Thanks, Yeon.

744
01:02:08,844 --> 01:02:12,174
The 9-year-old me and
the 30-year-old me...

745
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:15,013
both lived thanks to you.

746
01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:18,413
You see,

747
01:02:19,413 --> 01:02:23,123
I may not be able to kick
butt and control the weather,

748
01:02:24,594 --> 01:02:27,864
but I'll return
the favour someday.

749
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:33,534
You can count on
me to protect you.

750
01:02:54,324 --> 01:02:56,554
Do you perhaps
have the ability...

751
01:02:56,554 --> 01:02:59,223
to duplicate this
bottle of soju?

752
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:03,293
Like the Miracle of
the Loaves and Fishes?

753
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:04,364
Yes.

754
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:06,864
I'm not Jesus, you know.
Just drink what you have.

755
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:40,223
Are you leaving on
the first boat out?

756
01:04:42,464 --> 01:04:43,563
I see you're limping.

757
01:04:46,163 --> 01:04:48,804
You sacrificed your leg
to avenge your father.

758
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:51,304
How did you...

759
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,333
You were lucky enough to
live to tell the tale.

760
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,174
Don't ever resort to
cursing people again.

761
01:04:58,143 --> 01:05:00,074
Karma can sting.

762
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:06,924
It's empty.

763
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,524
- What?
- Everyone's gone.

764
01:05:09,683 --> 01:05:10,793
What do mean?

765
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:14,493
It's as if the entire
village vanished.

766
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,694
Not even a human
shadow is in sight.

767
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:31,963
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

768
01:06:32,234 --> 01:06:35,904
<i>It's the place where
evil spirits come and go.</i>

769
01:06:36,704 --> 01:06:39,313
<i>How dare you! What
were you thinking?</i>

770
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,313
<i>Why do you hate your
older brother so much?</i>

771
01:06:43,114 --> 01:06:44,284
<i>If you want to live,</i>

772
01:06:44,954 --> 01:06:46,883
<i>you'd better not
fall asleep tonight.</i>

773
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:52,654
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

774
01:06:52,654 --> 01:06:55,664
<i>Your lady won't get to live
a long life this time either.</i>

775
01:06:55,864 --> 01:06:59,234
<i>The Underworld of Knives. Then
I'll be able to leave today.</i>

776
01:06:59,593 --> 01:07:01,704
<i>Or you might never
be able to leave.</i>
