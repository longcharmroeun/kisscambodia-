8
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,545
I'd like to know one thing.

9
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:36,814
What made you decide...

10
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:38,715
to team up with me?

11
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,624
Probably the same reason you
decided to team up with me.

12
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:53,964
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:55,865
You must die for me to live.

14
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,065
I'll end this all myself.

15
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:01,035
Don't do this. If you do...

16
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,134
Farewell.

17
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,684
See? Ji A warned you...

18
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,154
not to do this.

19
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,654
What? You're not...

20
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:22,764
You're not Ji A.

21
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,425
How could you fail to
recognize your own master?

22
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,065
You darn insect.

23
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,735
How dare you? I let you live
longer than you deserved.

24
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:30,804
"Insect"?

25
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,634
I wouldn't have
stayed by your side...

26
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,475
if it weren't for
the ground cherries.

27
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,404
I'll be honest with
you. You make me sick.

28
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,744
You're just a guy with
an inferiority complex...

29
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,845
who's neither a deity nor human.

30
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,725
You talk too much.

31
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:51,425
You've lived for way too long.

32
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:53,395
Just go to the Underworld.

33
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,225
I bet your family's
waiting for you.

34
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,695
- Dad.
- I don't even remember when.

35
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,334
But there was a time when I had
something I wanted to protect...

36
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,364
with all my life.

37
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:07,905
Dad, where are you coming from?

38
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:10,745
- What did you buy, Dad?
- My kids,

39
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:13,614
- wife, and mother.
- Dad.

40
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:16,445
But I barely even
remember their faces.

41
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,884
Darn it.

42
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,664
Did you see that?

43
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,604
This feels unfamiliar.

44
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,445
Those who poured me wine...

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,215
were always those who
begged me for more time.

46
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:52,884
They begged me to
help them stay alive.

47
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,285
For 1 more day. For 1 more year.

48
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,354
There's no need to brag
about not having any friends.

49
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:02,625
It's because I
don't trust anyone.

50
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,225
It sounds like you failed
to gain people's trust.

51
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:06,734
It means I have
nothing to protect.

52
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,905
That's what makes me
stronger than you.

53
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,544
I'm stronger than you...

54
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,914
because I have
someone to protect.

55
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,014
Are you sure?

56
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,745
It looks like Ji A's
going through something.

57
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:28,084
My other half has just woken up.

58
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:29,315
What?

59
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,185
Sit down.

60
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,695
If you leave before I
finish this glass of wine,

61
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,264
our deal will no
longer be valid.

62
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:40,095
This is my only chance to
take him to the Samdo River.

63
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,965
Should I give up and
go to Ji A? Or...

64
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:46,834
Don't worry.

65
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:50,345
He shows up when
he senses danger.

66
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,204
For example, when I bleed.

67
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,074
He's very protective of himself.

68
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,014
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

69
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:58,945
At least Ji A will be.

70
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:10,764
This is how we're different.

71
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,935
I'm not sure about that.
You also have something...

72
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:14,935
you must protect at all costs.

73
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:19,235
For example, your other half
that lives in Ji A's body.

74
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:22,945
I heard you'll become pretty
insignificant once that dies.

75
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,675
It looks like you
tried to play smart,

76
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,545
but why did you have to hide
something so precious...

77
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,945
inside the woman I love and
cause such a nasty mess?

78
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:35,514
I noticed you took a scale.

79
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:36,985
- Do you want it back?
- Will you give it back?

80
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:37,985
If you give me back Ji A.

81
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,495
The gatekeeper of the
Samdo River comes first.

82
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:58,144
Don't come near me.

83
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:02,745
Please don't come.

84
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,815
I'm already here.

85
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:07,654
What will you do?

86
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:08,815
Will you kill me?

87
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,084
If I die, Ji A will die as well.

88
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,195
- Would you like to shoot me?
- Do you think...

89
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:19,594
I won't be able to?

90
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,394
Like you saw earlier,
you only get one shot.

91
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:24,964
If you fail, I'll be
the one killing you.

92
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:28,904
Okay then. I'm going
to count to three.

93
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:30,974
You have until then to decide.

94
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:34,974
- One.
- Do you think the three of us...

95
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,245
met by coincidence?

96
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,545
No, I think it was fate.

97
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:40,185
- Two.
- The guy who's after me...

98
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:41,915
is a lot closer to
us than we think.

99
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,024
I'd like to protect you guys...

100
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:47,755
just like how you both
protected me in our past lives.

101
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:49,154
Three.

102
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,295
Darn it. I knew it.

103
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,165
Ji A!

104
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,675
Come to your senses, you brat.

105
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:07,115
Why do you have so much
blood on your hands?

106
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,974
There's blood all over
your nice clothes.

107
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:14,985
Sae Rom?

108
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:20,024
Yes, it's me. Do
you recognize us?

109
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,464
Jae Hwan.

110
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:31,904
I'm okay.

111
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:33,605
I didn't get hurt at all.

112
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:44,514
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,014
I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:53,224
It's okay. We're all
fine. That's what matters.

115
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,324
It's okay.

116
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,255
What am I going to do?

117
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,935
- What am I going to do?
- You'll be fine.

118
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,534
How do you plan to attack that old
woman who guards the Samdo River?

119
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,235
How much do you know about her?

120
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,605
I know she can easily turn...

121
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,344
a mountain spirit into a rock
with the blink of an eye.

122
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,115
And I heard she can
see miles ahead of her.

123
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,745
About that power she has
to see miles ahead...

124
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,384
How far do you
think she can see?

125
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,654
For example, do you think
she knows how I look?

126
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,625
It's not a surveillance camera.

127
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,625
She's just able to catch the
overall flow of how things go.

128
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,795
For example, she may not be
able to hear our conversation.

129
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:36,034
But she's probably able to tell
that we're together right now.

130
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,065
So she doesn't know
everything in detail?

131
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,344
If we block her sight,
we might be able to win.

132
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:45,675
How?

133
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,315
This is what you used
to make me fall asleep.

134
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:58,954
Rang only took a small sip,
but it worked pretty well.

135
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,724
Do you think she'll drink this?

136
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,264
She might.

137
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:07,594
That is, if we use the
one person she trusts.

138
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:08,935
Who's that?

139
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:11,834
Hyeonuiong.

140
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,605
I heard he does everything
his wife tells him to do.

141
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:20,915
Not anymore.

142
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,584
He disobeyed her and saved Ji A.
That's good enough to prove that.

143
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:36,195
So he's going to put her to
sleep before we get there?

144
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,795
Once she falls asleep,

145
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:41,535
you can take care of her.

146
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,364
- When are we going to do this?
- Tomorrow.

147
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,204
Meet me there at noon.

148
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,004
Once it's all done,

149
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:51,074
you gain control over the
Samdo River as we promised,

150
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:54,045
and your ill-fated relationship
with me and Ji A will end there.

151
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,185
Okay.

152
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:04,984
I wonder why I'm so worried.

153
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,954
Things are going a lot
smoother than I thought.

154
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,594
No, what matters is
that he took the bait.

155
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:18,435
I just need to take
him to the Samdo River.

156
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:23,305
Didn't they once have a son?

157
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,285
How do you know that?

158
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,945
I just know.

159
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,594
How do you think
this story will end?

160
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,734
It's going to be a happy
ending no matter what.

161
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,525
Our station president came.

162
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,165
He had the same
disease as Sae Rom.

163
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:55,895
He said he could
live if he killed me.

164
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:58,734
Where is he?

165
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:00,704
He's dead.

166
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,344
I shot him.

167
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,074
I turned into Imoogi, and...

168
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:16,254
He defied death and
lived for centuries.

169
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,155
He wouldn't have made it past
today even if you hadn't shot him.

170
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,295
I almost killed Jae Hwan too.

171
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,135
I finally came to
my senses, but...

172
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,905
You did well. You did.

173
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,374
I'm so scared.

174
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,214
It's almost over.

175
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,084
It'll be over tomorrow.

176
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,525
Don't you need to urinate?

177
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:57,265
I don't do things
like that much.

178
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,334
You're lying in bed in
my place of business.

179
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,334
Why are you being shy?

180
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:09,504
Why are you so good to me?

181
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:12,175
You even closed the
restaurant because of me.

182
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:15,045
People come and go in your
life. That's how it is.

183
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:18,185
You said you lost your husband
a long time ago, right?

184
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:22,885
What was your husband like?

185
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:28,594
Even if we shared one
small fish together,

186
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:31,925
he'd debone it and
give me some first.

187
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,435
Once, it was the
middle of winter.

188
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,964
I said I wanted
honey-filled rice cakes,

189
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,805
and he climbed over a snowy
hill just to get them for me.

190
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,905
He could've just called
a delivery service.

191
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:48,015
Why did he do that?
He's a bit over the top.

192
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:49,974
What about you?

193
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,415
Why do you keep coming to me?

194
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,984
Whenever I eat your food,

195
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,185
my heart...

196
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,954
gets all tickly.

197
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,594
It feels very familiar, and it
feels like it's something...

198
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:08,035
I've missed.

199
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,374
How many souls crossed over the
river last night because of Imoogi?

200
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,204
903?

201
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:23,614
Call in the emergency staff, and
tell them to hang on one more night.

202
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,594
Honey!

203
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,474
For when my honey's
eyes are tired.

204
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,614
To soothe my honey's temper.

205
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,084
It's good for when my
honey has a stomachache.

206
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:06,754
Is something wrong?

207
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,224
Granny's arthritis medicine...

208
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,795
has probably run out now.

209
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,494
Whatever. I don't
care. Whatever.

210
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:18,935
Go home.

211
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,734
You've rebelled long enough.

212
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,974
- Forget it.
- You know you'll regret it.

213
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,074
I'm already regretting it.

214
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:30,015
Why did I think I
could change her?

215
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,145
Why couldn't I leave
her when I lost my son?

216
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,515
- Because you loved her...
- I did.

217
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,584
I thought it was love.

218
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:41,854
Our personalities, preferences...
We had nothing in common.

219
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,695
We couldn't even share a
plate of tteokbokki together.

220
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:48,295
I always got mild, and
she got the spiciest.

221
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,435
Couldn't you split
a medium spicy?

222
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,135
That's married life.

223
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,775
We were just too different.

224
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,974
So? Will you just watch?

225
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,614
You said Yeon may die...

226
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:06,185
in that lady's place.

227
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:09,015
There's no other reason for
Granny to keep her alive.

228
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,785
- Stop him.
- If he would listen to me,

229
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,055
things wouldn't
have come this far.

230
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,695
But we can't...

231
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:19,094
lose Yeon like this.

232
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,775
<font color="#00ff00">YEON</font>

233
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:37,185
Hey, what's up?

234
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:38,545
Let's meet.

235
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:41,055
Say it over the phone.
I'm ready to hear it.

236
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:42,584
It's too long to say
it over the phone.

237
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,984
I just met with Imoogi.

238
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,395
You did?

239
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:50,724
Okay.

240
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,895
What's with that reaction?

241
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,504
Is that girl dead or alive?

242
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,484
What do you mean?

243
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:17,584
Why would you swallow his scale?

244
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,155
Because if I do, Imoogi,
who's inside of Ji A,

245
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:25,525
will transfer over to me.

246
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,765
- And then?
- I'll take him with me...

247
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,435
and jump into the Samdo River.

248
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:37,175
No. Definitely not.

249
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,614
I'm sure there's another way.

250
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:46,545
It isn't...

251
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,214
just Ji A.

252
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,655
Countless lives being lost...

253
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,885
because of this plague
are at stake as well.

254
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:56,524
I thought about every
possibility available,

255
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,804
and this is the only
way to catch him.

256
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,075
Then I'll do it.

257
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,905
I'll swallow his scale and
jump into the Samdo River.

258
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,675
You can't handle Imoogi.

259
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,945
Don't do it.

260
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,085
Please, don't do it. You can't
even save your soul then.

261
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,155
You can't be
reincarnated or anything.

262
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,454
- I know.
- Then please!

263
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,494
Can you not say
you're going to die?

264
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,304
Shin Ju.

265
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:49,575
You must...

266
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,314
understand me.

267
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,724
I'm telling you everything
because it's you.

268
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:07,935
You're so mean.

269
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:11,064
You're so mean to me.

270
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:25,784
What brings you here?

271
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,885
Thanks for the gift.

272
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:31,385
- The gift?
- You sent our president to me.

273
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:35,195
Why didn't you tell
Yeon if you knew?

274
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:36,794
Because I would've
done the same.

275
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,625
If I were you, I would've
told Yeon long ago.

276
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,895
I did not, and I don't plan to.

277
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:44,504
Why not?

278
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:46,764
Because Yeon cherishes you.

279
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:51,075
Because he'll be
sad if he loses you.

280
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,845
Do you even know
what it means...

281
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,185
for Yeon to team up with Imoogi?

282
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,925
- What does it mean?
- He plans to save you and die.

283
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:07,395
Because of you,

284
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:09,625
Yeon will die.

285
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:14,365
Yeon is planning to die
in order to save me?

286
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,794
Isn't it obvious?

287
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,165
Which gets me to my point...

288
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:24,304
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't kill you...

289
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,304
here and now.

290
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:32,544
If it's your wish,
I won't stop you.

291
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:34,954
But I don't want
to encourage it.

292
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,254
You'll either die or get hurt.

293
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,355
Someone else just tried it.

294
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,095
I'll be straightforward
with you.

295
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,165
I don't intend to die.

296
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:50,165
At least not yet.

297
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:51,704
"Not yet"?

298
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:00,405
If by chance, I hurt Yeon,

299
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:02,774
I will kill myself.

300
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,314
If by chance, I fail,

301
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:07,954
you kill me.

302
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,484
Yeon won't be able to kill me.

303
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:15,024
Do you mean it?

304
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,764
Unfortunately, we
share a common goal.

305
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:22,794
Protecting Yeon.

306
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:27,974
If you want to save your
brother, we need a truce for now.

307
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,405
Okay?

308
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,024
Deal.

309
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:49,624
What do you need me to do then?

310
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,535
Don't get caught
up in this battle,

311
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:58,634
stay alive,

312
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:01,834
and protect Ji A.

313
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,144
In my place,

314
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,245
you'll look after her.

315
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:09,775
I will.

316
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,685
And if Rang...

317
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,384
suffers a heartbreak
and acts out again,

318
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,195
you'll give him an earful.

319
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,195
Tell him to get
his act together.

320
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:30,164
I will do that until
his ears fall off.

321
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,975
Start a family with
the necklace thief.

322
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:41,614
Consider this as a
pre-wedding gift.

323
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,045
It's a new apartment
in your name.

324
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,985
Thank you for putting
up with my temper.

325
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:52,884
Mr. Lee...

326
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:56,995
Thanking you for
all your troubles...

327
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,525
That I won't do.

328
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:03,795
I made up for it by
paying for your expenses.

329
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,064
Mr. Lee,

330
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,175
may I ask you one thing?

331
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:14,545
When I was being chased by
the mountain spirit I served,

332
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,745
why did you save me?

333
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:19,584
For payback.

334
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:24,925
I had bibim noodles with
your mountain spirit once...

335
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:29,124
and he had the audacity
to steal my boiled egg.

336
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:31,124
That's why you saved me?

337
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:33,265
It wasn't for nothing,
you know. You see,

338
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,465
I always save my boiled egg
to enjoy it at the very end.

339
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:19,205
What's the meaning of this?

340
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,775
Why should a bowl of
naengmyeon carry meaning?

341
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:24,945
Why are you treating me
to this all of a sudden?

342
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,185
You're buying, actually.
I skipped lunch today.

343
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:30,884
As if I don't know
how you think.

344
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:33,485
Can we just eat without
this giving me indigestion?

345
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,304
It's true that you only
add mustard and no vinegar.

346
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:47,134
What?

347
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:49,604
Ki Yu Ri. That's what she said.

348
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,644
You only add mustard
in your naengmyeon.

349
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:54,814
Did she say that?

350
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:58,084
One needs to be attentive
to know that, you know.

351
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,854
Well, I saved her life.

352
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:03,814
If I hadn't saved her,
she would've starved...

353
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,985
or been beaten to
death at the zoo.

354
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,894
What's with that kid
at your house though?

355
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:13,925
It's Geomdoong, my
dog from my past life.

356
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:20,104
I don't care if he was
your dog back then.

357
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,935
You can't take him away from
his current parents like that.

358
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,344
His stepfather has been beating
him, and that made me angry.

359
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,314
- Why are you laughing?
- It's funny, that's all.

360
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,314
For someone who's been
causing mayhem like the Joker,

361
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,584
it's funny to know that you've
been doing good deeds too.

362
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,824
- Shut it.
- Look at you all grown up now.

363
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:40,455
Bedwetter.

364
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:42,495
I'll kill you, you know.

365
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:51,404
Give me your egg if you're
not going to eat it.

366
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,094
You don't have to look
overtly unhappy, you know.

367
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:16,295
I hate being here with you.

368
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,664
I want to go home.

369
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,324
Home?

370
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:21,935
As if you have a
home to go back to.

371
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:24,804
You attacked Lee Rang
with your own hands...

372
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,164
and Shin Ju ended the
relationship with you yesterday.

373
00:26:27,574 --> 00:26:29,304
No one will want you back.

374
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,675
You're wrong. Mr. Lee
will be waiting for me.

375
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:34,045
Shin Ju too.

376
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:36,475
Actually, this is
where you belong.

377
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:39,545
You've been beaten by
a human, haven't you?

378
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:42,955
For a long time too until
your soul ended up ragged.

379
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,384
I see the darkness in you.

380
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:50,255
Don't read people like that.

381
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:52,525
It's what makes you freakier.

382
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:55,465
A thing like you...

383
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:59,304
will only spread misfortune
to Lee Rang or Shin Ju.

384
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,134
Like me.

385
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,304
So don't bother with
the wishful thinking.

386
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,545
No one will come to save you.

387
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:12,185
I speak from experience.

388
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:20,384
Is that naengmyeon that good?

389
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,795
At least it tastes good.

390
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:23,554
I still don't get what
you see in that girl.

391
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,295
For what reason are you willing
to give up your life for her?

392
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,104
She saved me in my past life.

393
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:35,104
She died for me.

394
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:37,705
If I don't stop her,

395
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:40,245
she'll give up her own life...

396
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:42,644
to save mine again.

397
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,185
She always keeps her
promises, you see.

398
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:49,154
Then let her save you.

399
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:50,485
That's what she wants.

400
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:51,854
No way.

401
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:55,154
My pride can't handle
her saving me twice.

402
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,455
Crazy jerk.

403
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:59,725
So? You'll die instead of her?

404
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:04,535
Rang, join me tomorrow.

405
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,735
- Where?
- To Samdo River.

406
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:09,374
To end Imoogi.

407
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,205
I need you there to prevent...

408
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:14,745
any unexpected things
from happening.

409
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:15,975
What are you planning?

410
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,844
There's no need to
know the details.

411
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:21,455
Just be there to help
things go as planned.

412
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:24,985
I'll think about it.

413
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:28,925
Hey, I saved your
life twice, you know.

414
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,425
- There's no need to be calculative.
- I'm glad you said that.

415
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,594
Is that all the reaction you
can give to your brother?

416
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:36,334
Shouldn't you shed a tear
when I could actually die?

417
00:28:36,394 --> 00:28:37,465
You won't though.

418
00:28:38,364 --> 00:28:39,535
It's not like you're mortal.

419
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:44,675
A nine-tailed fox
can't die so easily.

420
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,045
The clear sky sure is nice.

421
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:53,015
It won't be a bad day
for the world to end.

422
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:55,314
What are you and
Mr. Lee planning to do?

423
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:57,384
Didn't you hear everything...

424
00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,185
that we discussed?

425
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,725
So you'll really end
up being an almighty?

426
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:05,295
What comes afterwards, then?

427
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:06,594
I'll rule the world...

428
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:08,795
and take Ji A for myself.

429
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:11,705
That's not what you promised!

430
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:13,505
What he requested
can't be granted.

431
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:15,535
I'm sure Lee Yeon
feels the same way.

432
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,874
That's why you should
accompany me to Samdo River.

433
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:21,344
Why should I go there?

434
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,985
Just in case he doesn't come alone.
I'll need you to keep them occupied.

435
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:28,154
- What if I don't want to?
- I wasn't asking for your opinion.

436
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,925
Maybe I should call
Lee Rang and Shin Ju.

437
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,094
It'll be over if
I suggest suicide.

438
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:38,795
You know you can't disobey me.

439
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,695
Just kill me instead, darn it!

440
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,235
That's not how things work.

441
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:46,664
If I kill you,

442
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,275
they won't get to
see you in despair.

443
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:14,664
What brings you here?

444
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:21,475
I may only be a mere cook,

445
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:27,175
but I can't sit back and
watch Mr. Lee Yeon die.

446
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,614
Just sit back...

447
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:32,285
and watch.

448
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:34,715
This isn't something
you can prevent.

449
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,154
But I can't.

450
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,255
What?

451
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,795
Snail Bride,

452
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:51,634
where are you right now?

453
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,935
The bridge between the
Afterlife and the Living Realm.

454
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,304
Tell me who I am.

455
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:59,804
The Lady of Samdo River.

456
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:01,715
Then,

457
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,685
you must be aware that
you just crossed the line.

458
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:06,945
I'm aware of that.

459
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:12,124
However, you're not just
the Lady of Samdo River.

460
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:14,154
You're also one's wife,

461
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:17,154
one's mother, and one's friend.

462
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:20,364
You're not Bok Gil's
mother or my wife.

463
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,765
Just the watchwoman
of Samdo River.

464
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:24,505
You're wrong.

465
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,505
Never have I been...

466
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:32,945
someone's wife, son, or friend.

467
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:40,515
Will you be okay...

468
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:42,955
even after Yeon dies?

469
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:46,054
- What?
- Forget about fate.

470
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,525
I'm asking about
how you'll feel.

471
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:51,094
For a very long time,

472
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,594
Yeon trusted and relied on you.

473
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,035
It's probably because you
cared for him that much.

474
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,064
And that's because...

475
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,205
he reminded you
of your late son.

476
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,675
Did my husband tell you that?

477
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:10,475
Then he must've also
told you what I did...

478
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,745
to my one and only son.

479
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,015
My son...

480
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,884
also stood there and
begged me just like Yeon.

481
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,925
He asked me to
let his wife live.

482
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,864
However, I refused
to help my son.

483
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,334
And that's why...

484
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:31,134
you've been beating
yourself up all these years.

485
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:40,404
How dare you?

486
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:43,445
I'm sorry if I crossed
the line. But...

487
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:45,245
Say one more word,

488
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:48,854
and I'll make sure you'll
never be able to cook again.

489
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,073
<font color="#00ff00">GLUCOSAMINE</font>

490
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:58,995
I was told to give you this.

491
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:01,535
Please...

492
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,664
don't give up on
Yeon or your husband.

493
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:21,213
<font color="#00ff00">GLUCOSAMINE</font>

494
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:26,425
Where are we off to this time?

495
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:28,995
You don't need to come.

496
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,394
I'll tell you what you
need to do once I'm back.

497
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:36,795
What? You said that to Yu Ri?

498
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:38,564
She used you?

499
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:39,735
It was a mistake.

500
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:42,775
Yu Ri told me she didn't care
whether those people died or not.

501
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,904
They're Ji A's parents,
so why would she care?

502
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:48,275
You crazy punk. How dare
you treat Yu Ri that way?

503
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:50,574
She's already risking
her life because of me.

504
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,215
I regret what I said to her.

505
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,285
But I don't know how to reach her,
and there's no way to apologize.

506
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,525
You're doomed now.

507
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:03,955
She holds a really bad grudge.

508
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,695
Can you talk to her...

509
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,195
The same goes for me.

510
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:10,894
I will never approve
of you and Yu Ri.

511
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:17,505
Do you think she'll be
able to come back safely?

512
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:21,515
We must do something. Let's go.

513
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:23,975
Where?

514
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:56,316
Yu Ri, it's me.

515
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,586
Your car's outside, so
I'm guessing you're there.

516
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:06,526
I don't care if he's
with you, so just listen.

517
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:09,696
You're in for some trouble
once you return home.

518
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,296
Who said you could
go live with him?

519
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:20,267
Things are so
uncomfortable without you.

520
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:22,176
No one's around to
buy me naengmyeon.

521
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:25,847
And the little kid put stickers
all over me. He drives me nuts.

522
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,307
You came all the way
here to say that?

523
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:29,477
What if she's not listening?

524
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,486
- Should we just barge in?
- No.

525
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,086
Yeon will get furious
if he finds out.

526
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:35,986
Then let me say
something as well.

527
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:38,327
Yu Ri, don't ever forgive him.

528
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:42,856
Yu Ri.

529
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:45,867
I'll save my apology for later.

530
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,097
I hope you return safely.

531
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:51,466
Don't listen to a word he says.

532
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,506
Just make sure you stay safe.

533
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:55,906
You see, I was...

534
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:56,937
planning on proposing to you...

535
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,406
- once you returned.
- Stop it.

536
00:35:58,477 --> 00:35:59,477
What?

537
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:03,247
Yu Ri.

538
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,747
I'll save you.

539
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:07,816
Just hang in there
until tomorrow.

540
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,586
- I'll also protect...
- That's enough. Let's go.

541
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:15,256
No, wait.

542
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,106
Guess who.

543
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,477
I can tell who you are just
by looking at these hands.

544
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:06,446
What if it's someone
else pretending to be me?

545
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:10,517
Then my heart wouldn't be
beating so fast like right now.

546
00:37:15,187 --> 00:37:17,086
I'm impressed by your lines.

547
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,827
Are you sure you stayed
single for 600 years?

548
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,126
Yes, of course.

549
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:23,526
I only have eyes for you.

550
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:25,126
You're all I see.

551
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,097
What are we doing today?

552
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:33,437
Today, we're going to go on a
date just like a normal couple.

553
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:34,566
You can look forward to it.

554
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:39,676
This is what normal couples
do. I'll walk by the road.

555
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:49,557
Why a claw crane?

556
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,126
I've always wanted to do this.

557
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:58,327
I know I'm rich enough to
buy this entire arcade.

558
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:01,597
But I want to give you
something that shows my effort.

559
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,597
Watch.

560
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:08,506
Don't fight the machine. You
need to go along with it.

561
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:10,537
Like this.

562
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:21,957
This is so cute.

563
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:23,756
- Let's try one more time.
- Try it again.

564
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:24,827
Help.

565
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:28,126
Like this. There.

566
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:29,227
Should I press the button?

567
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:32,167
It's working.

568
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:39,106
Ta-da.

569
00:38:56,187 --> 00:38:57,216
It's not going in.

570
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,227
No, no. Wait.

571
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,426
- Hold the ball like this.
- Let go.

572
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:03,727
This is a fight between
me and this machine.

573
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:14,836
Move. Move.

574
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:31,216
How do you like
your mint chocolate?

575
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:33,156
It's nice and fresh.

576
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:35,827
It's as if I have an
entire forest in my mouth.

577
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:37,997
How do you like your vanilla?

578
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,296
It's sweet.

579
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,637
This tastes like honey too.

580
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:48,637
Why don't we switch?

581
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,577
How about we mix it instead?

582
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:11,397
I think I love you a lot.

583
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,097
I've lived for so long.

584
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:19,006
And I have a vague memory
of all the people I've met.

585
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:23,307
But I remember every single
moment I spent with you.

586
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,546
Don't forget me.

587
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:29,847
Ever.

588
00:40:35,957 --> 00:40:37,756
How could I forget this face?

589
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:44,126
I love you, Yeon.

590
00:41:13,486 --> 00:41:14,586
Was that it?

591
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,827
Did you not leave me?

592
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,736
Did I abandon you?

593
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,336
Is that why I ended up this way?

594
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:34,106
I swore over and over that
I wouldn't forgive you.

595
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:37,247
But it turns out...

596
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:42,917
I couldn't forgive myself.

597
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:48,227
What kind...

598
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:51,897
of mom was I?

599
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,767
What did you wish?

600
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:34,207
That you'll be safe.

601
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:38,376
That you won't get hurt, sick...

602
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:40,876
or cry.

603
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:44,917
How selfish.

604
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:49,586
And that you could
forget everything...

605
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,626
if something beyond
our control happens.

606
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:58,796
No. I'll wait for you.

607
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,267
Just as you waited for me.

608
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:11,276
No, don't.

609
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,446
A human being's
life is too short.

610
00:43:15,546 --> 00:43:18,046
What did you wish?

611
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:21,287
I wished that a very
kind deity exists...

612
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:24,387
somewhere in this world,

613
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:28,497
and prayed for something
like a miracle.

614
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:32,227
And I wished...

615
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,736
the deity to save us both.

616
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:58,216
Hi, Granny.

617
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:03,296
What? Now?

618
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:11,906
What did you mean?

619
00:44:15,707 --> 00:44:18,506
I've been smoking for very long.

620
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:25,077
There were only two people
who nagged me to quit.

621
00:44:26,517 --> 00:44:29,656
- You, and...
- And the other was your son.

622
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,687
He was the kindest kid.

623
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:35,856
But...

624
00:44:36,856 --> 00:44:40,796
when his wife died,
he never spoke again.

625
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:45,736
I wish he would've just
resented me openly.

626
00:44:47,037 --> 00:44:49,106
And then he jumped
into the Samdo River?

627
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:52,606
He left the shoes I made
him nicely on the riverbank.

628
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:54,606
That jerk.

629
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:56,946
As if he wanted me to see them.

630
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:00,046
As if to say he wouldn't
forgive me even after he died.

631
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:02,687
You're wrong.

632
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:07,026
He was so sad when he was
going to meet his dead wife,

633
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:11,597
but he didn't want
the shoes to get wet.

634
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,167
I'm an expert in that field.

635
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,406
I'm planning to quit smoking.

636
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:23,637
Do you mean it this time?

637
00:45:25,276 --> 00:45:28,776
I've lived long enough. I want
to try something different.

638
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:31,876
What do you mean?

639
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,586
I'm saying there's a way
to put an end to this...

640
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,856
without either you
or that girl dying.

641
00:45:40,156 --> 00:45:41,227
What is it?

642
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,227
Good work everyone.

643
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,597
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

644
00:45:50,937 --> 00:45:52,437
Get home safely.

645
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:55,066
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

646
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:56,506
- Good night - Good night.

647
00:45:58,707 --> 00:45:59,807
Let's go.

648
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:05,046
<font color="#00ff00">STAFF ONLY ADMITTANCE</font>

649
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:26,336
When Imoogi comes here tomorrow,

650
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:29,336
stab Ji A with this sword.

651
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:37,417
Stab her enough to kill her.

652
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:40,046
- What?
- When she's almost dead,

653
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,856
Imoogi's other half in Ji A's body
will try to escape her body...

654
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:44,816
before she dies.

655
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:47,586
- What about the scale?
- Don't use it.

656
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:50,057
Let him transfer
into Imoogi's body.

657
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,796
Once the divided
Imoogi becomes one,

658
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,537
I'll turn it into stone.

659
00:46:56,637 --> 00:47:01,037
But what if Ji A
ends up really dying?

660
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:04,876
I'll save her.

661
00:47:08,446 --> 00:47:11,376
I'll be punished as well
for breaking a taboo.

662
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:13,946
Granny.

663
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:19,256
Don't say anything sappy,
and bring them here on time.

664
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:21,756
Both her and Imoogi.

665
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:29,296
You know, I knew from the
start that you weren't all bad.

666
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:33,336
Get off of me, kid.

667
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:02,667
I enjoyed the performance.

668
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:04,937
Thank you.

669
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:07,707
I see you're not human either.

670
00:48:08,836 --> 00:48:10,406
You've got a sharp eye.

671
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,747
Human or not, the
park is closed now.

672
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,887
I'm looking for something.

673
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:23,017
If you've lost something,
check Lost and Found.

674
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:25,117
There's no need.

675
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:29,296
I've just found it.

676
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,897
What is it?

677
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,637
The mirror of the moon.

678
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:54,147
After my mom passed away,

679
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:58,057
I felt like I was left
all alone in this world.

680
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:01,656
But I wasn't lonely at all...

681
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:05,097
because I had you and Jae Hwan.

682
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,566
Thanks.

683
00:49:10,037 --> 00:49:11,497
Hang in there.

684
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:15,406
Please.

685
00:49:15,937 --> 00:49:17,037
Ms. Nam.

686
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:19,747
Yes?

687
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:22,216
You need to take this.

688
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:32,017
Is someone close to dying?

689
00:49:32,957 --> 00:49:34,026
Where are you?

690
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,466
Very close to where you are.

691
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:14,597
Finally, you're here to see me.

692
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:16,736
- Where's the antidote?
- Why are you worried about others?

693
00:50:17,196 --> 00:50:18,466
You're day to day yourself.

694
00:50:18,466 --> 00:50:19,736
Where is the antidote?

695
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:21,736
There is no such thing.

696
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:25,707
I was born from the plague,
so I know how to kill people,

697
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:28,376
but I never learned
how to save them.

698
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:30,446
You scumbag.

699
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:32,617
You'll die soon.

700
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,687
I want you to die and
rot in the Underworld.

701
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:40,756
This is why I like you.

702
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:45,097
Even though you can barely
keep your own soul dominant,

703
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:47,696
you still won't give in.

704
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,597
- You'll be mine in the end.
- As if.

705
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,667
I'd rather die than
let you have me.

706
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:58,236
From this moment on, you'll
truly wish you were dead.

707
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:02,046
Show yourself.

708
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:19,126
Don't join forces with Lee Yeon.

709
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:23,097
Those imbeciles are
plotting something.

710
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:26,566
It doesn't matter.

711
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:29,676
Besides, you have a job to do.

712
00:51:56,037 --> 00:51:57,037
What are you doing here?

713
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:00,667
The governor was attacked.

714
00:52:01,336 --> 00:52:02,477
What?

715
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:05,406
What are you talking about?

716
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:07,647
Who attacked him?

717
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:09,077
Imoogi.

718
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,316
He survived,

719
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:14,247
but he lost something important.

720
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:22,796
You're him, aren't you?

721
00:52:25,156 --> 00:52:26,267
Now comes the quiz.

722
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,897
What exactly was taken
from the governor?

723
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:35,876
The mirror of the moon.

724
00:52:37,477 --> 00:52:38,506
How...

725
00:52:40,946 --> 00:52:44,147
How is it that
you have his face?

726
00:52:49,856 --> 00:52:51,787
It's the face you
missed, isn't it?

727
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:55,426
The poor child you killed.

728
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,997
Your one and only son.

729
00:52:58,597 --> 00:53:01,126
My Bok Gil...

730
00:53:01,227 --> 00:53:02,667
When being reincarnated,

731
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,437
I selected the shell that'd
stir something in you.

732
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,367
I had a feeling
this day would come.

733
00:53:08,836 --> 00:53:10,736
How can you know about my son?

734
00:53:12,137 --> 00:53:13,676
Here comes the next question.

735
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:17,647
Why do you think my other half
went after the mirror of the moon?

736
00:53:20,446 --> 00:53:22,957
No... Granny!

737
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,727
- You're staying here with me.
- No...

738
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:29,256
Shin Ju.

739
00:53:30,196 --> 00:53:32,966
- Why...
- Because I was summoned.

740
00:53:35,227 --> 00:53:38,867
Someday, when the Imoogi
in her calls for you...

741
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:42,736
You'll become my soldier.

742
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:55,216
Bok Gil was a sweet
kid, you know.

743
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:57,517
Others found me repulsive,

744
00:53:58,057 --> 00:54:00,086
but he came up to me to talk.

745
00:54:00,856 --> 00:54:03,196
I felt like I had a
friend for the first time.

746
00:54:04,026 --> 00:54:05,256
Did you know this though?

747
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,597
I was the one...

748
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:11,236
who planted the
plague in his wife.

749
00:54:15,236 --> 00:54:16,276
Why...

750
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:18,977
Why did you do such a thing?

751
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:25,216
Because he seemed so happy.

752
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:41,667
Darn you!

753
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:12,426
Let's go. We need Granny.

754
00:55:12,966 --> 00:55:15,367
- It's too late.
- Snap out of it, Ji A!

755
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:19,767
We can both survive this. For
the first time, there's hope.

756
00:55:23,637 --> 00:55:24,937
Darn, my head.

757
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:29,776
- Mr. Lee!
- Shin Ju, stay out of this.

758
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,247
Rang, come with me.

759
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:34,147
- I'm sorry, we...
- Later!

760
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:37,117
You were only compelled
by him, that's all.

761
00:55:37,586 --> 00:55:38,617
Take Ji A with you.

762
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:40,887
Just a second.

763
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:48,066
Let go. I can get there myself.

764
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:05,117
Where's Granny?

765
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:09,517
Where is she?

766
00:56:11,486 --> 00:56:12,517
Did you get her?

767
00:56:15,086 --> 00:56:17,997
It truly is a treasure
of a mountain spirit.

768
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:02,977
Showing up with
her son's face...

769
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:05,537
made her lose her reason.

770
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:09,006
You can call her the spirit
of spirits all you want.

771
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,747
As long as she harbors
a human's heart,

772
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,716
she'll always have a weak spot.

773
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,626
This was your plan all along.

774
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:29,296
It's all your fault, Yeon.

775
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:31,367
Because you didn't give up,

776
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:34,906
innocent people had to die
as well as the old lady.

777
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:37,876
And now, Ji A is dying too.

778
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:33,566
Ji A...

779
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:36,867
Please.

780
00:58:50,546 --> 00:58:52,787
Even in this state, you
can't lay a finger on me.

781
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:56,856
So just give up
your body and die.

782
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:58,986
You're out of options now.

783
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:02,126
This is the only
way to save Ji A.

784
00:59:36,997 --> 00:59:38,057
That's enough.

785
00:59:41,097 --> 00:59:42,196
Let Ji A go.

786
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:44,867
I'll...

787
00:59:52,477 --> 00:59:53,807
let you have my body.

788
01:00:17,271 --> 01:00:18,670
What are you doing here?

789
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,340
Rang, you can't go
inside. I won't let you.

790
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:29,510
Yu Ri.

791
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:32,780
I'm here to save you and Yeon.

792
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:37,090
But if anything happens to Yeon,

793
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,231
I swear I'll kill you.

794
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:51,041
Don't.

795
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,510
- Ji A.
- Don't move.

796
01:01:01,981 --> 01:01:03,920
You're still hanging in there?

797
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,021
No, don't.

798
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,791
Put that gun down. Please.

799
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:16,090
I'll protect you, Yeon.

800
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:17,601
No, let me do it.

801
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,570
Goodbye.

802
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:53,670
No, don't. No!

803
01:01:55,871 --> 01:01:57,271
Come out from that body.

804
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,481
Forgive me. I'm doing
this to protect you, Rang.

805
01:02:24,561 --> 01:02:25,630
Yeon.

806
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:27,170
Don't come near me.

807
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,470
- Yeon!
- Stay away!

808
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,441
No!

809
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,521
The Yeon you know is dead.

810
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:47,050
I won.

811
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,411
What's going on?

812
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,650
I look hideous, don't I?

813
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,420
I wanted to look nice...

814
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,950
before I say goodbye.

815
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,360
But still,

816
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:03,030
we won.

817
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:19,981
This is my gift.

818
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,481
When your other
half becomes weak,

819
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:25,650
you become weak as well.

820
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,170
It's the evening primrose
from a burial ground.

821
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:22,641
Yeon!

822
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:48,501
Darn it.

823
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:20,630
Rang.

824
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,371
Rang!

825
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,150
It hurts, doesn't it?

826
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,291
You and I are one now.

827
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,191
If you kill me,
you'll die as well.

828
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,891
That's exactly what I want.

829
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,380
Rang.

830
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:12,981
No, I can't.

831
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:17,220
Pretty soon,

832
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,191
I'll turn into Imoogi.

833
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,901
Let me stay as myself.

834
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,370
Rang.

835
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:32,040
No.

836
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,830
Rang.

837
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:01,701
Save me.

838
01:08:43,981 --> 01:08:46,510
I will be born again.

839
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,910
I will be born again,

840
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:51,851
and I will find her again.

841
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,191
You don't know what
you're talking about.

842
01:08:56,451 --> 01:08:58,361
Once you fall into
the Samdo River,

843
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,891
you'll never be
able to come back.

844
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,410
No.

845
01:09:39,696 --> 01:09:40,726
No.

846
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:51,617
I love you.

847
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:54,748
No!

848
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:58,051
No!

849
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:39,220
He smiled.

850
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,630
As if he was relieved...

851
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,630
that he had saved me.

852
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:50,063
As if this was his happy ending.

853
01:10:54,137 --> 01:10:55,366
I feel like...

854
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:00,267
I may have heard...

855
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:01,887
Yeon!

856
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,601
the word "love" at the end.

857
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,612
<b><font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font></b>

858
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,521
<i>I can really do
anything you ask.</i>

859
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:48,630
<i>Please tell me...</i>

860
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:51,330
<i>That will never happen.</i>

861
01:11:52,031 --> 01:11:54,571
<i>Get it together. Mr. Lee
told me to give this to you.</i>

862
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:57,870
<i>You'll get used to it. I'm
sure you'll have to walk...</i>

863
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:01,271
<i>the path we walked
together, alone,</i>

864
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:03,811
<i>but please let me go.</i>

865
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,010
<i>I love you, Ji A.</i>

866
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:10,010
<i>I heard the rumors and
came to see that old man.</i>
