DESTINY THAT IS YOU</font>

2
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:44,445
I'd like to know one thing.

3
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,714
What made you decide...

4
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,615
to team up with me?

5
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,524
Probably the same reason you
decided to team up with me.

6
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,864
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,765
You must die for me to live.

8
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:08,965
I'll end this all myself.

9
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,935
Don't do this. If you do...

10
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,034
Farewell.

11
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:25,584
See? Ji A warned you...

12
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,054
not to do this.

13
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,554
What? You're not...

14
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:33,664
You're not Ji A.

15
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,325
How could you fail to
recognize your own master?

16
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:37,965
You darn insect.

17
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,635
How dare you? I let you live
longer than you deserved.

18
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,704
"Insect"?

19
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:43,534
I wouldn't have
stayed by your side...

20
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:46,375
if it weren't for
the ground cherries.

21
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,304
I'll be honest with
you. You make me sick.

22
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,644
You're just a guy with
an inferiority complex...

23
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,745
who's neither a deity nor human.

24
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,625
You talk too much.

25
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,325
You've lived for way too long.

26
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,295
Just go to the Underworld.

27
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,125
I bet your family's
waiting for you.

28
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:12,595
- Dad.
- I don't even remember when.

29
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:15,234
But there was a time when I had
something I wanted to protect...

30
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,264
with all my life.

31
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:18,805
Dad, where are you coming from?

32
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,645
- What did you buy, Dad?
- My kids,

33
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:24,514
- wife, and mother.
- Dad.

34
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:27,345
But I barely even
remember their faces.

35
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,784
Darn it.

36
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,564
Did you see that?

37
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:55,504
This feels unfamiliar.

38
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,345
Those who poured me wine...

39
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:01,115
were always those who
begged me for more time.

40
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:03,784
They begged me to
help them stay alive.

41
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,185
For 1 more day. For 1 more year.

42
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,254
There's no need to brag
about not having any friends.

43
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,525
It's because I
don't trust anyone.

44
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:16,125
It sounds like you failed
to gain people's trust.

45
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,634
It means I have
nothing to protect.

46
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,805
That's what makes me
stronger than you.

47
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:27,444
I'm stronger than you...

48
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,814
because I have
someone to protect.

49
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:32,914
Are you sure?

50
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,645
It looks like Ji A's
going through something.

51
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:38,984
My other half has just woken up.

52
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,215
What?

53
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,085
Sit down.

54
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,595
If you leave before I
finish this glass of wine,

55
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,164
our deal will no
longer be valid.

56
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:50,995
This is my only chance to
take him to the Samdo River.

57
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,865
Should I give up and
go to Ji A? Or...

58
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:57,734
Don't worry.

59
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:01,245
He shows up when
he senses danger.

60
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,104
For example, when I bleed.

61
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,974
He's very protective of himself.

62
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,914
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

63
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,845
At least Ji A will be.

64
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,664
This is how we're different.

65
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:23,835
I'm not sure about that.
You also have something...

66
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:25,835
you must protect at all costs.

67
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,135
For example, your other half
that lives in Ji A's body.

68
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:33,845
I heard you'll become pretty
insignificant once that dies.

69
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,575
It looks like you
tried to play smart,

70
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,445
but why did you have to hide
something so precious...

71
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,845
inside the woman I love and
cause such a nasty mess?

72
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,414
I noticed you took a scale.

73
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,885
- Do you want it back?
- Will you give it back?

74
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,885
If you give me back Ji A.

75
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,395
The gatekeeper of the
Samdo River comes first.

76
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,044
Don't come near me.

77
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,645
Please don't come.

78
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:16,715
I'm already here.

79
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,554
What will you do?

80
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:19,715
Will you kill me?

81
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,984
If I die, Ji A will die as well.

82
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,095
- Would you like to shoot me?
- Do you think...

83
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,494
I won't be able to?

84
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,294
Like you saw earlier,
you only get one shot.

85
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:35,864
If you fail, I'll be
the one killing you.

86
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,804
Okay then. I'm going
to count to three.

87
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,874
You have until then to decide.

88
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:45,874
- One.
- Do you think the three of us...

89
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,145
met by coincidence?

90
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:48,445
No, I think it was fate.

91
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:51,085
- Two.
- The guy who's after me...

92
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:52,815
is a lot closer to
us than we think.

93
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,924
I'd like to protect you guys...

94
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,655
just like how you both
protected me in our past lives.

95
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:00,054
Three.

96
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,195
Darn it. I knew it.

97
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,065
Ji A!

98
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,575
Come to your senses, you brat.

99
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:18,015
Why do you have so much
blood on your hands?

100
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:19,874
There's blood all over
your nice clothes.

101
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,885
Sae Rom?

102
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:30,924
Yes, it's me. Do
you recognize us?

103
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,364
Jae Hwan.

104
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,804
I'm okay.

105
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,505
I didn't get hurt at all.

106
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,414
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,914
I'm so sorry.

108
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,124
It's okay. We're all
fine. That's what matters.

109
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,224
It's okay.

110
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,155
What am I going to do?

111
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,835
- What am I going to do?
- You'll be fine.

112
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,434
How do you plan to attack that old
woman who guards the Samdo River?

113
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:18,135
How much do you know about her?

114
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,505
I know she can easily turn...

115
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,244
a mountain spirit into a rock
with the blink of an eye.

116
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,015
And I heard she can
see miles ahead of her.

117
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,645
About that power she has
to see miles ahead...

118
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:31,284
How far do you
think she can see?

119
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,554
For example, do you think
she knows how I look?

120
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,525
It's not a surveillance camera.

121
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,525
She's just able to catch the
overall flow of how things go.

122
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,695
For example, she may not be
able to hear our conversation.

123
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,934
But she's probably able to tell
that we're together right now.

124
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,965
So she doesn't know
everything in detail?

125
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:54,244
If we block her sight,
we might be able to win.

126
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,575
How?

127
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,215
This is what you used
to make me fall asleep.

128
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,854
Rang only took a small sip,
but it worked pretty well.

129
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,624
Do you think she'll drink this?

130
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,164
She might.

131
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:18,494
That is, if we use the
one person she trusts.

132
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:19,835
Who's that?

133
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,734
Hyeonuiong.

134
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:30,505
I heard he does everything
his wife tells him to do.

135
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:31,815
Not anymore.

136
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,484
He disobeyed her and saved Ji A.
That's good enough to prove that.

137
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,095
So he's going to put her to
sleep before we get there?

138
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,695
Once she falls asleep,

139
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,435
you can take care of her.

140
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:54,264
- When are we going to do this?
- Tomorrow.

141
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,104
Meet me there at noon.

142
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,904
Once it's all done,

143
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:01,974
you gain control over the
Samdo River as we promised,

144
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,945
and your ill-fated relationship
with me and Ji A will end there.

145
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,085
Okay.

146
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:15,884
I wonder why I'm so worried.

147
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,854
Things are going a lot
smoother than I thought.

148
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:25,494
No, what matters is
that he took the bait.

149
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:29,335
I just need to take
him to the Samdo River.

150
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,205
Didn't they once have a son?

151
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,185
How do you know that?

152
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,845
I just know.

153
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,494
How do you think
this story will end?

154
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:00,634
It's going to be a happy
ending no matter what.

155
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:58,425
Our station president came.

156
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:02,065
He had the same
disease as Sae Rom.

157
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,795
He said he could
live if he killed me.

158
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,634
Where is he?

159
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,604
He's dead.

160
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:14,244
I shot him.

161
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,974
I turned into Imoogi, and...

162
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:27,154
He defied death and
lived for centuries.

163
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,055
He wouldn't have made it past
today even if you hadn't shot him.

164
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,195
I almost killed Jae Hwan too.

165
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,035
I finally came to
my senses, but...

166
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,805
You did well. You did.

167
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,274
I'm so scared.

168
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,114
It's almost over.

169
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:57,984
It'll be over tomorrow.

170
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,425
Don't you need to urinate?

171
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,165
I don't do things
like that much.

172
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:12,234
You're lying in bed in
my place of business.

173
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,234
Why are you being shy?

174
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:20,404
Why are you so good to me?

175
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,075
You even closed the
restaurant because of me.

176
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,945
People come and go in your
life. That's how it is.

177
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:29,085
You said you lost your husband
a long time ago, right?

178
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:33,785
What was your husband like?

179
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:39,494
Even if we shared one
small fish together,

180
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:42,825
he'd debone it and
give me some first.

181
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,335
Once, it was the
middle of winter.

182
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,864
I said I wanted
honey-filled rice cakes,

183
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,705
and he climbed over a snowy
hill just to get them for me.

184
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,805
He could've just called
a delivery service.

185
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,915
Why did he do that?
He's a bit over the top.

186
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:00,874
What about you?

187
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,315
Why do you keep coming to me?

188
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,884
Whenever I eat your food,

189
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,085
my heart...

190
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,854
gets all tickly.

191
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:16,494
It feels very familiar, and it
feels like it's something...

192
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:18,935
I've missed.

193
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:25,274
How many souls crossed over the
river last night because of Imoogi?

194
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,104
903?

195
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,514
Call in the emergency staff, and
tell them to hang on one more night.

196
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,494
Honey!

197
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,374
For when my honey's
eyes are tired.

198
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,514
To soothe my honey's temper.

199
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,984
It's good for when my
honey has a stomachache.

200
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,654
Is something wrong?

201
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,124
Granny's arthritis medicine...

202
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,695
has probably run out now.

203
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:27,394
Whatever. I don't
care. Whatever.

204
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,835
Go home.

205
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:32,634
You've rebelled long enough.

206
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,874
- Forget it.
- You know you'll regret it.

207
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:37,974
I'm already regretting it.

208
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,915
Why did I think I
could change her?

209
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:44,045
Why couldn't I leave
her when I lost my son?

210
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:46,415
- Because you loved her...
- I did.

211
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,484
I thought it was love.

212
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:52,754
Our personalities, preferences...
We had nothing in common.

213
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:55,595
We couldn't even share a
plate of tteokbokki together.

214
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:59,195
I always got mild, and
she got the spiciest.

215
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,335
Couldn't you split
a medium spicy?

216
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,035
That's married life.

217
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,675
We were just too different.

218
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,874
So? Will you just watch?

219
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,514
You said Yeon may die...

220
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,085
in that lady's place.

221
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,915
There's no other reason for
Granny to keep her alive.

222
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:22,685
- Stop him.
- If he would listen to me,

223
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,955
things wouldn't
have come this far.

224
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,595
But we can't...

225
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,994
lose Yeon like this.

226
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,675
<font color="#00ff00">YEON</font>

227
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,085
Hey, what's up?

228
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,445
Let's meet.

229
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,955
Say it over the phone.
I'm ready to hear it.

230
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,484
It's too long to say
it over the phone.

231
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,884
I just met with Imoogi.

232
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,295
You did?

233
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,624
Okay.

234
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,795
What's with that reaction?

235
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:10,404
Is that girl dead or alive?

236
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,384
What do you mean?

237
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,484
Why would you swallow his scale?

238
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:34,055
Because if I do, Imoogi,
who's inside of Ji A,

239
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,425
will transfer over to me.

240
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,665
- And then?
- I'll take him with me...

241
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:43,335
and jump into the Samdo River.

242
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:48,075
No. Definitely not.

243
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:54,514
I'm sure there's another way.

244
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,445
It isn't...

245
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:00,114
just Ji A.

246
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,555
Countless lives being lost...

247
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,785
because of this plague
are at stake as well.

248
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:07,424
I thought about every
possibility available,

249
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:14,704
and this is the only
way to catch him.

250
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,975
Then I'll do it.

251
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:21,805
I'll swallow his scale and
jump into the Samdo River.

252
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,575
You can't handle Imoogi.

253
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:27,845
Don't do it.

254
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,985
Please, don't do it. You can't
even save your soul then.

255
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:35,055
You can't be
reincarnated or anything.

256
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,354
- I know.
- Then please!

257
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,394
Can you not say
you're going to die?

258
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,204
Shin Ju.

259
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,475
You must...

260
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:05,214
understand me.

261
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,624
I'm telling you everything
because it's you.

262
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,835
You're so mean.

263
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,964
You're so mean to me.

264
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,684
What brings you here?

265
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,785
Thanks for the gift.

266
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,285
- The gift?
- You sent our president to me.

267
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,095
Why didn't you tell
Yeon if you knew?

268
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:47,694
Because I would've
done the same.

269
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,525
If I were you, I would've
told Yeon long ago.

270
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,795
I did not, and I don't plan to.

271
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,404
Why not?

272
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,664
Because Yeon cherishes you.

273
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,975
Because he'll be
sad if he loses you.

274
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,745
Do you even know
what it means...

275
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:12,085
for Yeon to team up with Imoogi?

276
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:15,825
- What does it mean?
- He plans to save you and die.

277
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,295
Because of you,

278
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:20,525
Yeon will die.

279
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,265
Yeon is planning to die
in order to save me?

280
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,694
Isn't it obvious?

281
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,065
Which gets me to my point...

282
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,204
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't kill you...

283
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,204
here and now.

284
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,444
If it's your wish,
I won't stop you.

285
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:45,854
But I don't want
to encourage it.

286
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,154
You'll either die or get hurt.

287
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,255
Someone else just tried it.

288
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,995
I'll be straightforward
with you.

289
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,065
I don't intend to die.

290
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,065
At least not yet.

291
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:02,604
"Not yet"?

292
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,305
If by chance, I hurt Yeon,

293
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,674
I will kill myself.

294
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,214
If by chance, I fail,

295
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:18,854
you kill me.

296
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,384
Yeon won't be able to kill me.

297
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:25,924
Do you mean it?

298
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,664
Unfortunately, we
share a common goal.

299
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,694
Protecting Yeon.

300
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:38,874
If you want to save your
brother, we need a truce for now.

301
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,305
Okay?

302
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:55,924
Deal.

303
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,524
What do you need me to do then?

304
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,435
Don't get caught
up in this battle,

305
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,534
stay alive,

306
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,734
and protect Ji A.

307
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,044
In my place,

308
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,145
you'll look after her.

309
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:20,675
I will.

310
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:27,585
And if Rang...

311
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,284
suffers a heartbreak
and acts out again,

312
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,095
you'll give him an earful.

313
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,095
Tell him to get
his act together.

314
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,064
I will do that until
his ears fall off.

315
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:47,875
Start a family with
the necklace thief.

316
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:52,514
Consider this as a
pre-wedding gift.

317
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,945
It's a new apartment
in your name.

318
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,885
Thank you for putting
up with my temper.

319
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:03,784
Mr. Lee...

320
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:07,895
Thanking you for
all your troubles...

321
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,425
That I won't do.

322
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,695
I made up for it by
paying for your expenses.

323
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:15,964
Mr. Lee,

324
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,075
may I ask you one thing?

325
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:25,445
When I was being chased by
the mountain spirit I served,

326
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,645
why did you save me?

327
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:30,484
For payback.

328
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,825
I had bibim noodles with
your mountain spirit once...

329
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:40,024
and he had the audacity
to steal my boiled egg.

330
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:42,024
That's why you saved me?

331
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,165
It wasn't for nothing,
you know. You see,

332
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,365
I always save my boiled egg
to enjoy it at the very end.

333
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,105
What's the meaning of this?

334
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,675
Why should a bowl of
naengmyeon carry meaning?

335
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:35,845
Why are you treating me
to this all of a sudden?

336
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,085
You're buying, actually.
I skipped lunch today.

337
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:41,784
As if I don't know
how you think.

338
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:44,385
Can we just eat without
this giving me indigestion?

339
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,204
It's true that you only
add mustard and no vinegar.

340
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,034
What?

341
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,504
Ki Yu Ri. That's what she said.

342
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,544
You only add mustard
in your naengmyeon.

343
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:05,714
Did she say that?

344
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,984
One needs to be attentive
to know that, you know.

345
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,754
Well, I saved her life.

346
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,714
If I hadn't saved her,
she would've starved...

347
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,885
or been beaten to
death at the zoo.

348
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,794
What's with that kid
at your house though?

349
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,825
It's Geomdoong, my
dog from my past life.

350
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:31,004
I don't care if he was
your dog back then.

351
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:33,835
You can't take him away from
his current parents like that.

352
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:37,244
His stepfather has been beating
him, and that made me angry.

353
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,214
- Why are you laughing?
- It's funny, that's all.

354
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:45,214
For someone who's been
causing mayhem like the Joker,

355
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:47,484
it's funny to know that you've
been doing good deeds too.

356
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:49,724
- Shut it.
- Look at you all grown up now.

357
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,355
Bedwetter.

358
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,395
I'll kill you, you know.

359
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,304
Give me your egg if you're
not going to eat it.

360
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:25,994
You don't have to look
overtly unhappy, you know.

361
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,195
I hate being here with you.

362
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,564
I want to go home.

363
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,224
Home?

364
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,835
As if you have a
home to go back to.

365
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:35,704
You attacked Lee Rang
with your own hands...

366
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:38,064
and Shin Ju ended the
relationship with you yesterday.

367
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:40,204
No one will want you back.

368
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,575
You're wrong. Mr. Lee
will be waiting for me.

369
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:44,945
Shin Ju too.

370
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:47,375
Actually, this is
where you belong.

371
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,445
You've been beaten by
a human, haven't you?

372
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:53,855
For a long time too until
your soul ended up ragged.

373
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,284
I see the darkness in you.

374
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,155
Don't read people like that.

375
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:03,425
It's what makes you freakier.

376
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,365
A thing like you...

377
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:10,204
will only spread misfortune
to Lee Rang or Shin Ju.

378
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,034
Like me.

379
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,204
So don't bother with
the wishful thinking.

380
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,445
No one will come to save you.

381
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,085
I speak from experience.

382
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,284
Is that naengmyeon that good?

383
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:32,695
At least it tastes good.

384
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,454
I still don't get what
you see in that girl.

385
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:37,195
For what reason are you willing
to give up your life for her?

386
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,004
She saved me in my past life.

387
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:46,004
She died for me.

388
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,605
If I don't stop her,

389
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,145
she'll give up her own life...

390
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,544
to save mine again.

391
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:58,085
She always keeps her
promises, you see.

392
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,054
Then let her save you.

393
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,385
That's what she wants.

394
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:02,754
No way.

395
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:06,054
My pride can't handle
her saving me twice.

396
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:07,355
Crazy jerk.

397
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:10,625
So? You'll die instead of her?

398
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:15,435
Rang, join me tomorrow.

399
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,635
- Where?
- To Samdo River.

400
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,274
To end Imoogi.

401
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:24,105
I need you there to prevent...

402
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:25,645
any unexpected things
from happening.

403
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,875
What are you planning?

404
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,744
There's no need to
know the details.

405
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:32,355
Just be there to help
things go as planned.

406
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,885
I'll think about it.

407
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:39,825
Hey, I saved your
life twice, you know.

408
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,325
- There's no need to be calculative.
- I'm glad you said that.

409
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,494
Is that all the reaction you
can give to your brother?

410
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,234
Shouldn't you shed a tear
when I could actually die?

411
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:48,365
You won't though.

412
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:50,435
It's not like you're mortal.

413
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:55,575
A nine-tailed fox
can't die so easily.

414
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,945
The clear sky sure is nice.

415
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,915
It won't be a bad day
for the world to end.

416
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:06,214
What are you and
Mr. Lee planning to do?

417
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:08,284
Didn't you hear everything...

418
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,085
that we discussed?

419
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,625
So you'll really end
up being an almighty?

420
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:16,195
What comes afterwards, then?

421
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,494
I'll rule the world...

422
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:19,695
and take Ji A for myself.

423
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,605
That's not what you promised!

424
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:24,405
What he requested
can't be granted.

425
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:26,435
I'm sure Lee Yeon
feels the same way.

426
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,774
That's why you should
accompany me to Samdo River.

427
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:32,244
Why should I go there?

428
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,885
Just in case he doesn't come alone.
I'll need you to keep them occupied.

429
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:39,054
- What if I don't want to?
- I wasn't asking for your opinion.

430
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,825
Maybe I should call
Lee Rang and Shin Ju.

431
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,994
It'll be over if
I suggest suicide.

432
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,695
You know you can't disobey me.

433
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,595
Just kill me instead, darn it!

434
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:56,135
That's not how things work.

435
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:57,564
If I kill you,

436
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,175
they won't get to
see you in despair.

437
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:25,564
What brings you here?

438
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:32,375
I may only be a mere cook,

439
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:38,075
but I can't sit back and
watch Mr. Lee Yeon die.

440
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:41,514
Just sit back...

441
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:43,185
and watch.

442
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,615
This isn't something
you can prevent.

443
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:47,054
But I can't.

444
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:50,155
What?

445
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,695
Snail Bride,

446
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:02,534
where are you right now?

447
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,835
The bridge between the
Afterlife and the Living Realm.

448
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,204
Tell me who I am.

449
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:10,704
The Lady of Samdo River.

450
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:12,615
Then,

451
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,585
you must be aware that
you just crossed the line.

452
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:17,845
I'm aware of that.

453
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:23,024
However, you're not just
the Lady of Samdo River.

454
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,054
You're also one's wife,

455
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,054
one's mother, and one's friend.

456
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:31,264
You're not Bok Gil's
mother or my wife.

457
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:33,665
Just the watchwoman
of Samdo River.

458
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:35,405
You're wrong.

459
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:39,405
Never have I been...

460
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:43,845
someone's wife, son, or friend.

461
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:51,415
Will you be okay...

462
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:53,855
even after Yeon dies?

463
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,954
- What?
- Forget about fate.

464
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,425
I'm asking about
how you'll feel.

465
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:01,994
For a very long time,

466
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,494
Yeon trusted and relied on you.

467
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:08,935
It's probably because you
cared for him that much.

468
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,964
And that's because...

469
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,105
he reminded you
of your late son.

470
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,575
Did my husband tell you that?

471
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:21,375
Then he must've also
told you what I did...

472
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:23,645
to my one and only son.

473
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,915
My son...

474
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,784
also stood there and
begged me just like Yeon.

475
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,825
He asked me to
let his wife live.

476
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,764
However, I refused
to help my son.

477
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,234
And that's why...

478
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:42,034
you've been beating
yourself up all these years.

479
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:51,304
How dare you?

480
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:54,345
I'm sorry if I crossed
the line. But...

481
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,145
Say one more word,

482
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,754
and I'll make sure you'll
never be able to cook again.

483
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:05,973
<font color="#00ff00">GLUCOSAMINE</font>

484
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,895
I was told to give you this.

485
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,435
Please...

486
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,564
don't give up on
Yeon or your husband.

487
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:32,113
<font color="#00ff00">GLUCOSAMINE</font>

488
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:37,325
Where are we off to this time?

489
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:39,895
You don't need to come.

490
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,294
I'll tell you what you
need to do once I'm back.

491
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,695
What? You said that to Yu Ri?

492
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:49,464
She used you?

493
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:50,635
It was a mistake.

494
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:53,675
Yu Ri told me she didn't care
whether those people died or not.

495
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,804
They're Ji A's parents,
so why would she care?

496
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,175
You crazy punk. How dare
you treat Yu Ri that way?

497
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,474
She's already risking
her life because of me.

498
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:07,115
I regret what I said to her.

499
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:10,185
But I don't know how to reach her,
and there's no way to apologize.

500
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,425
You're doomed now.

501
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,855
She holds a really bad grudge.

502
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,595
Can you talk to her...

503
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,095
The same goes for me.

504
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,794
I will never approve
of you and Yu Ri.

505
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:28,405
Do you think she'll be
able to come back safely?

506
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,415
We must do something. Let's go.

507
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,875
Where?

508
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:07,216
Yu Ri, it's me.

509
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,486
Your car's outside, so
I'm guessing you're there.

510
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,426
I don't care if he's
with you, so just listen.

511
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,596
You're in for some trouble
once you return home.

512
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:23,196
Who said you could
go live with him?

513
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,167
Things are so
uncomfortable without you.

514
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,076
No one's around to
buy me naengmyeon.

515
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,747
And the little kid put stickers
all over me. He drives me nuts.

516
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:38,207
You came all the way
here to say that?

517
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,377
What if she's not listening?

518
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,386
- Should we just barge in?
- No.

519
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:43,986
Yeon will get furious
if he finds out.

520
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:46,886
Then let me say
something as well.

521
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:49,227
Yu Ri, don't ever forgive him.

522
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:53,756
Yu Ri.

523
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:56,767
I'll save my apology for later.

524
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,997
I hope you return safely.

525
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,366
Don't listen to a word he says.

526
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,406
Just make sure you stay safe.

527
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,806
You see, I was...

528
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:07,837
planning on proposing to you...

529
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,306
- once you returned.
- Stop it.

530
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,377
What?

531
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,147
Yu Ri.

532
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:16,647
I'll save you.

533
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:18,716
Just hang in there
until tomorrow.

534
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,486
- I'll also protect...
- That's enough. Let's go.

535
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,156
No, wait.

536
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,006
Guess who.

537
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,377
I can tell who you are just
by looking at these hands.

538
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,346
What if it's someone
else pretending to be me?

539
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,417
Then my heart wouldn't be
beating so fast like right now.

540
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,986
I'm impressed by your lines.

541
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,727
Are you sure you stayed
single for 600 years?

542
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:32,026
Yes, of course.

543
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,426
I only have eyes for you.

544
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,026
You're all I see.

545
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,997
What are we doing today?

546
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,337
Today, we're going to go on a
date just like a normal couple.

547
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:45,466
You can look forward to it.

548
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,576
This is what normal couples
do. I'll walk by the road.

549
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:00,457
Why a claw crane?

550
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:03,026
I've always wanted to do this.

551
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,227
I know I'm rich enough to
buy this entire arcade.

552
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,497
But I want to give you
something that shows my effort.

553
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,497
Watch.

554
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:19,406
Don't fight the machine. You
need to go along with it.

555
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,437
Like this.

556
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:32,857
This is so cute.

557
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,656
- Let's try one more time.
- Try it again.

558
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:35,727
Help.

559
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:39,026
Like this. There.

560
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:40,127
Should I press the button?

561
00:37:41,897 --> 00:37:43,067
It's working.

562
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,006
Ta-da.

563
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,116
It's not going in.

564
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,127
No, no. Wait.

565
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,326
- Hold the ball like this.
- Let go.

566
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:14,627
This is a fight between
me and this machine.

567
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:25,736
Move. Move.

568
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,116
How do you like
your mint chocolate?

569
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:44,056
It's nice and fresh.

570
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:46,727
It's as if I have an
entire forest in my mouth.

571
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:48,897
How do you like your vanilla?

572
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,196
It's sweet.

573
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,537
This tastes like honey too.

574
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,537
Why don't we switch?

575
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,477
How about we mix it instead?

576
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:22,297
I think I love you a lot.

577
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,997
I've lived for so long.

578
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:29,906
And I have a vague memory
of all the people I've met.

579
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:34,207
But I remember every single
moment I spent with you.

580
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,446
Don't forget me.

581
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:40,747
Ever.

582
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:48,656
How could I forget this face?

583
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,026
I love you, Yeon.

584
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:25,486
Was that it?

585
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:29,727
Did you not leave me?

586
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:33,636
Did I abandon you?

587
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,236
Is that why I ended up this way?

588
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:45,006
I swore over and over that
I wouldn't forgive you.

589
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,147
But it turns out...

590
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,817
I couldn't forgive myself.

591
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,127
What kind...

592
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:02,797
of mom was I?

593
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:38,667
What did you wish?

594
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:45,107
That you'll be safe.

595
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:49,276
That you won't get hurt, sick...

596
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:51,776
or cry.

597
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:55,817
How selfish.

598
00:41:56,716 --> 00:42:00,486
And that you could
forget everything...

599
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:05,526
if something beyond
our control happens.

600
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:09,696
No. I'll wait for you.

601
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,167
Just as you waited for me.

602
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:22,176
No, don't.

603
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,346
A human being's
life is too short.

604
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:28,946
What did you wish?

605
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:32,187
I wished that a very
kind deity exists...

606
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:35,287
somewhere in this world,

607
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:39,397
and prayed for something
like a miracle.

608
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,127
And I wished...

609
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:46,636
the deity to save us both.

610
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:09,116
Hi, Granny.

611
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:14,196
What? Now?

612
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:22,806
What did you mean?

613
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,406
I've been smoking for very long.

614
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,977
There were only two people
who nagged me to quit.

615
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:40,556
- You, and...
- And the other was your son.

616
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,587
He was the kindest kid.

617
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:46,756
But...

618
00:43:47,756 --> 00:43:51,696
when his wife died,
he never spoke again.

619
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,636
I wish he would've just
resented me openly.

620
00:43:57,937 --> 00:44:00,006
And then he jumped
into the Samdo River?

621
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,506
He left the shoes I made
him nicely on the riverbank.

622
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:05,506
That jerk.

623
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:07,846
As if he wanted me to see them.

624
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,946
As if to say he wouldn't
forgive me even after he died.

625
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:13,587
You're wrong.

626
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:17,926
He was so sad when he was
going to meet his dead wife,

627
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:22,497
but he didn't want
the shoes to get wet.

628
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:26,067
I'm an expert in that field.

629
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,306
I'm planning to quit smoking.

630
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,537
Do you mean it this time?

631
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:39,676
I've lived long enough. I want
to try something different.

632
00:44:41,716 --> 00:44:42,776
What do you mean?

633
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,486
I'm saying there's a way
to put an end to this...

634
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:48,756
without either you
or that girl dying.

635
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:52,127
What is it?

636
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:59,127
Good work everyone.

637
00:45:00,037 --> 00:45:01,497
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

638
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:03,337
Get home safely.

639
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:05,966
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

640
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,406
- Good night - Good night.

641
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:10,707
Let's go.

642
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:15,946
<font color="#00ff00">STAFF ONLY ADMITTANCE</font>

643
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:37,236
When Imoogi comes here tomorrow,

644
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,236
stab Ji A with this sword.

645
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:48,317
Stab her enough to kill her.

646
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,946
- What?
- When she's almost dead,

647
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,756
Imoogi's other half in Ji A's body
will try to escape her body...

648
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:55,716
before she dies.

649
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,486
- What about the scale?
- Don't use it.

650
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,957
Let him transfer
into Imoogi's body.

651
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:03,696
Once the divided
Imoogi becomes one,

652
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,437
I'll turn it into stone.

653
00:46:07,537 --> 00:46:11,937
But what if Ji A
ends up really dying?

654
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:15,776
I'll save her.

655
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:22,276
I'll be punished as well
for breaking a taboo.

656
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:24,846
Granny.

657
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:30,156
Don't say anything sappy,
and bring them here on time.

658
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,656
Both her and Imoogi.

659
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:40,196
You know, I knew from the
start that you weren't all bad.

660
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,236
Get off of me, kid.

661
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,567
I enjoyed the performance.

662
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:15,837
Thank you.

663
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,607
I see you're not human either.

664
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,306
You've got a sharp eye.

665
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:26,647
Human or not, the
park is closed now.

666
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:29,787
I'm looking for something.

667
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:33,917
If you've lost something,
check Lost and Found.

668
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:36,017
There's no need.

669
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,196
I've just found it.

670
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,797
What is it?

671
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,537
The mirror of the moon.

672
00:48:02,977 --> 00:48:05,047
After my mom passed away,

673
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,957
I felt like I was left
all alone in this world.

674
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:12,556
But I wasn't lonely at all...

675
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:15,997
because I had you and Jae Hwan.

676
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:19,466
Thanks.

677
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:22,397
Hang in there.

678
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:26,306
Please.

679
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:27,937
Ms. Nam.

680
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:30,647
Yes?

681
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:33,116
You need to take this.

682
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:42,917
Is someone close to dying?

683
00:48:43,857 --> 00:48:44,926
Where are you?

684
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:52,366
Very close to where you are.

685
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:25,497
Finally, you're here to see me.

686
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:27,636
- Where's the antidote?
- Why are you worried about others?

687
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:29,366
You're day to day yourself.

688
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,636
Where is the antidote?

689
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:32,636
There is no such thing.

690
00:49:33,276 --> 00:49:36,607
I was born from the plague,
so I know how to kill people,

691
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,276
but I never learned
how to save them.

692
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:41,346
You scumbag.

693
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:43,517
You'll die soon.

694
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,587
I want you to die and
rot in the Underworld.

695
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,656
This is why I like you.

696
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:55,997
Even though you can barely
keep your own soul dominant,

697
00:49:56,357 --> 00:49:58,596
you still won't give in.

698
00:50:00,337 --> 00:50:02,497
- You'll be mine in the end.
- As if.

699
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,567
I'd rather die than
let you have me.

700
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:09,136
From this moment on, you'll
truly wish you were dead.

701
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:12,946
Show yourself.

702
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:30,026
Don't join forces with Lee Yeon.

703
00:50:30,797 --> 00:50:33,997
Those imbeciles are
plotting something.

704
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:37,466
It doesn't matter.

705
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:40,576
Besides, you have a job to do.

706
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:07,937
What are you doing here?

707
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:11,567
The governor was attacked.

708
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,377
What?

709
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:16,306
What are you talking about?

710
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:18,547
Who attacked him?

711
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:19,977
Imoogi.

712
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,216
He survived,

713
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,147
but he lost something important.

714
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,696
You're him, aren't you?

715
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,167
Now comes the quiz.

716
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:39,797
What exactly was taken
from the governor?

717
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,776
The mirror of the moon.

718
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:49,406
How...

719
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:55,047
How is it that
you have his face?

720
00:52:00,756 --> 00:52:02,687
It's the face you
missed, isn't it?

721
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:06,326
The poor child you killed.

722
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,897
Your one and only son.

723
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:12,026
My Bok Gil...

724
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:13,567
When being reincarnated,

725
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:15,337
I selected the shell that'd
stir something in you.

726
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,267
I had a feeling
this day would come.

727
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,636
How can you know about my son?

728
00:52:23,037 --> 00:52:24,576
Here comes the next question.

729
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:28,547
Why do you think my other half
went after the mirror of the moon?

730
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:33,857
No... Granny!

731
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:36,627
- You're staying here with me.
- No...

732
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:40,156
Shin Ju.

733
00:52:41,096 --> 00:52:43,866
- Why...
- Because I was summoned.

734
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:49,767
Someday, when the Imoogi
in her calls for you...

735
00:52:50,736 --> 00:52:53,636
You'll become my soldier.

736
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,116
Bok Gil was a sweet
kid, you know.

737
00:53:06,547 --> 00:53:08,417
Others found me repulsive,

738
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:10,986
but he came up to me to talk.

739
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,096
I felt like I had a
friend for the first time.

740
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,156
Did you know this though?

741
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:18,497
I was the one...

742
00:53:19,627 --> 00:53:22,136
who planted the
plague in his wife.

743
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,176
Why...

744
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:29,877
Why did you do such a thing?

745
00:53:33,446 --> 00:53:36,116
Because he seemed so happy.

746
00:53:49,656 --> 00:53:52,567
Darn you!

747
00:54:21,497 --> 00:54:23,326
Let's go. We need Granny.

748
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:26,267
- It's too late.
- Snap out of it, Ji A!

749
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,667
We can both survive this. For
the first time, there's hope.

750
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,837
Darn, my head.

751
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:40,676
- Mr. Lee!
- Shin Ju, stay out of this.

752
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:42,147
Rang, come with me.

753
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:45,047
- I'm sorry, we...
- Later!

754
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:48,017
You were only compelled
by him, that's all.

755
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,517
Take Ji A with you.

756
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,787
Just a second.

757
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,966
Let go. I can get there myself.

758
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,017
Where's Granny?

759
00:55:19,247 --> 00:55:20,417
Where is she?

760
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:23,417
Did you get her?

761
00:55:25,986 --> 00:55:28,897
It truly is a treasure
of a mountain spirit.

762
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:13,877
Showing up with
her son's face...

763
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,437
made her lose her reason.

764
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:19,906
You can call her the spirit
of spirits all you want.

765
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,647
As long as she harbors
a human's heart,

766
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,616
she'll always have a weak spot.

767
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,526
This was your plan all along.

768
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,196
It's all your fault, Yeon.

769
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,267
Because you didn't give up,

770
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:45,806
innocent people had to die
as well as the old lady.

771
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:48,776
And now, Ji A is dying too.

772
00:57:43,457 --> 00:57:44,466
Ji A...

773
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,767
Please.

774
00:58:01,446 --> 00:58:03,687
Even in this state, you
can't lay a finger on me.

775
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,756
So just give up
your body and die.

776
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:09,886
You're out of options now.

777
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:13,026
This is the only
way to save Ji A.

778
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:48,957
That's enough.

779
00:58:51,997 --> 00:58:53,096
Let Ji A go.

780
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,767
I'll...

781
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:04,707
let you have my body.

782
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:29,570
What are you doing here?

783
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,240
Rang, you can't go
inside. I won't let you.

784
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:40,410
Yu Ri.

785
00:59:40,921 --> 00:59:43,680
I'm here to save you and Yeon.

786
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,990
But if anything happens to Yeon,

787
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,131
I swear I'll kill you.

788
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:01,941
Don't.

789
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,410
- Ji A.
- Don't move.

790
01:00:12,881 --> 01:00:14,820
You're still hanging in there?

791
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,921
No, don't.

792
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:20,691
Put that gun down. Please.

793
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,990
I'll protect you, Yeon.

794
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,501
No, let me do it.

795
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,470
Goodbye.

796
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:04,570
No, don't. No!

797
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:08,171
Come out from that body.

798
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,381
Forgive me. I'm doing
this to protect you, Rang.

799
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:36,530
Yeon.

800
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,070
Don't come near me.

801
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:40,370
- Yeon!
- Stay away!

802
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:48,341
No!

803
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,421
The Yeon you know is dead.

804
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,950
I won.

805
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,311
What's going on?

806
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,550
I look hideous, don't I?

807
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,320
I wanted to look nice...

808
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:05,850
before I say goodbye.

809
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,260
But still,

810
01:03:12,731 --> 01:03:13,930
we won.

811
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:30,881
This is my gift.

812
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,381
When your other
half becomes weak,

813
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:36,550
you become weak as well.

814
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,070
It's the evening primrose
from a burial ground.

815
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,541
Yeon!

816
01:04:58,331 --> 01:04:59,401
Darn it.

817
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,530
Rang.

818
01:05:34,941 --> 01:05:36,271
Rang!

819
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,050
It hurts, doesn't it?

820
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,191
You and I are one now.

821
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:54,091
If you kill me,
you'll die as well.

822
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,791
That's exactly what I want.

823
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,280
Rang.

824
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:23,881
No, I can't.

825
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,120
Pretty soon,

826
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,091
I'll turn into Imoogi.

827
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,801
Let me stay as myself.

828
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:41,270
Rang.

829
01:06:41,841 --> 01:06:42,940
No.

830
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,730
Rang.

831
01:07:10,971 --> 01:07:12,601
Save me.

832
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:57,410
I will be born again.

833
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,810
I will be born again,

834
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,751
and I will find her again.

835
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:06,091
You don't know what
you're talking about.

836
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:09,261
Once you fall into
the Samdo River,

837
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,791
you'll never be
able to come back.

838
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,310
No.

839
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:51,626
No.

840
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:02,517
I love you.

841
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:05,648
No!

842
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:08,951
No!

843
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:50,120
He smiled.

844
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,530
As if he was relieved...

845
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,530
that he had saved me.

846
01:09:57,352 --> 01:10:00,963
As if this was his happy ending.

847
01:10:05,037 --> 01:10:06,266
I feel like...

848
01:10:09,397 --> 01:10:11,167
I may have heard...

849
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,787
Yeon!

850
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,501
the word "love" at the end.

851
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:54,512
<font color="#00ff00">TALE OF THE NINE TAILED</font>

852
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,421
<i>I can really do
anything you ask.</i>

853
01:10:58,391 --> 01:10:59,530
<i>Please tell me...</i>

854
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:02,230
<i>That will never happen.</i>

855
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:05,471
<i>Get it together. Mr. Lee
told me to give this to you.</i>

856
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,770
<i>You'll get used to it. I'm
sure you'll have to walk...</i>

857
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,171
<i>the path we walked
together, alone,</i>

858
01:11:13,011 --> 01:11:14,711
<i>but please let me go.</i>

859
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,910
<i>I love you, Ji A.</i>

860
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,910
<i>I heard the rumors and
came to see that old man.</i>
