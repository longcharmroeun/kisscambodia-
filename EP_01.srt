00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,980
everyone in the Ban family

is busy preparing for
Baroness Ban’s wedding

5

with Young Master of the Xie family.

6

Pay attention to the notes!

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,860
Why do you always play the wrong notes?

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,980
And the one outside!

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,740
Get it done mindfully.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,100
Don’t make any mistakes.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,740
Yes, Master.

12

Where is Ban Heng?

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,700

15

Madam!

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,980
We got everything ready

17

including the things flying in the sky,
running on the ground,

Ten strings of South Sea Pearls.

Forty pairs of

Fifty luminous pearls.

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,540
Remember it well.

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,820
Baroness Ban’s wedding is pending.

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,060
Everyone should be mindful.

26
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,420
The bride’s escort team has arrived!

27
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,820
Come to help. Hurry!

28

Dress up Baroness Ban.

29
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,300
Speaking of the bride, Ban Hua,

30
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,620
what she is most famous for

31
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,380
is not only her outstanding appearance,

32
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,660
the generous personality,

33
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,860
but also her trend-setting
fashion taste.

34
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,300
She is basically the top character
in the capital of Daye.

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,900
Am I late?

36
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,060
Not at all. You’re just in time.

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,900
Come on, push it!

38
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,580
But in terms of
the appearance and talent

39
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,460
of Xie Qilin,

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,660
this bridegroom is unremarkable.

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,500
With the coming of the wedding day,

42
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,140
all the people are
looking forward to it.

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,740
It’s just what they want to see

44
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,180
is not how luxurious this wedding is.

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,780
They want to know

46
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,060
whether this wedding
can be held successfully.

47
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,580
Hua!

48
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,780

Ridiculous.

181

It’s not like I had never seen a man.

182

Since ancient times,

the etiquette never says
that women have to be

gentle and virtuous.

That’s very interesting.

191
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,740
Interesting?

192
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,340
Young Master, why is that interesting?

193
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,980
This woman is fierce and doughty.

194
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,020
It’s not interesting at all.

I told you the Xie family
was not strong and reliable enough.

203

We don’t understand what you mean.

216

For example,

217
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,820
Xie Qilin broke off the engagement

218
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
and fled with someone.

219
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,260
I seem to have dreamed about
all of these things.

220

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,340

Yeah. It is.

229
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,020
Hua, listen.

230
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,780
It’s like this.

231
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
For me,

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,060
the marriage is important.

233
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,860
But your health and happiness

are the top priorities.

235
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,460
Yeah.

236
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,940
Right?

237
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,500
Exactly.

238
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,660
He just broke off the engagement.

239
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,980
Don’t take it personally.

240
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,460
Yeah.

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,140
Mother is right.

242
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,500

this is the album of
beautiful men I just got.

245
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,500
Just tell me the one you like.

246
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
I’ll tie him up
and get him for you if I need to.

247
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,180
Hua, look at Count Cheng’an.

248
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,980
He is way better than Xie Qilin.

249
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,380
And his parents are gone.

250
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,180
If you marry him,

251
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,620
you can live a comfortable life without
in-laws meddling in your affairs.

252
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,740
You can’t understand it.

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,380
Madam and Master

254
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
are still worried
that you are upset about it.

255
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,740
A little Xie Qilin can’t hurt me.

I’ll go to Anle’s chrysanthemum
appreciation banquet tonight.

262
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,980
But I think those ladies

263
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,180
are busy gossiping behind your back

264
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,660
about what happened today.

265
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,700
I think,

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,260
why don’t you pass
the chrysanthemum banquet?

267
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,020
I’m going.

268
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Why would I pass it?

269
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,780
I’ll go there beautifully.

270
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,740
I want them to know

271
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,580
that even he broke it off with me,

272
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,060
I’m still the most beautiful one.

273
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,540
Rocky.

274
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,460
The floral decals.

275
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,420
Baroness.

276
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,380
These are the most popular
floral decals.

277
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,260
Pick one.

278
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,620
I want peony.

279
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,980
Peony?

280
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,140
But recently, those ladies think

281
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,420
peach blossom and peony

282
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,900
are cheesy.

283
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,820
They think it’s cheesy

284
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,060
because they can’t hold it.

285
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,980
But I am

286
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,180

287

For a woman,

288
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,420
it’s not that the more gold
and silver, the better.

289
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,540
Her stuff must be exquisite.

290
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,580
Look at those stuff

291
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,420
I wear for fun.

292
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,780
They have never seen them.

293
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,340
And they said I was showing off.

294
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,620
I don’t even have enough time
to take care of my face.

295
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,460
Why would I show off to them?

296

Have you heard that Baroness Ban
was dumped again?

308
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,740
Baroness Ban might not
show up this time.

She must be crying at home.
How would she have nerve to come here?

310
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,460
Long time no see.

311

You haven’t changed at all.

Most of you are phony,

I’ve got nothing to hide.

315
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,500
Why not coming?

316
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
However,

317
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,340
Xie family raised

how could my brother be scared away?

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,140
Feixian, never mind.

337
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,940
We are here to recite poems
and admire flowers.

338
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
Let’s ignore those

339
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
irrelevant people.

340
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,500
Who is the irrelevant person?

341
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,260
Anle!

342
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,100
Hua, you didn’t let me down.

343
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,180
I knew you would come.

344
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,340
Of course.

345
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,420
It’s your invitation.

346
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
I have to come even the sky is falling.

347
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,380
What were you arguing about?

348
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,380
She is too rude.
I’m sure no one dares to marry her.

349
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,740
How do you know
that no one will marry me?

350
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,300
Who will marry you?

351
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,060
The most talented man, Count Cheng’an.

352
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,100
When did this happen?

353
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
How could I not know it?

354
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,380
Count Cheng’an is
the most talented man in Daye.

355
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,620
He was selected by the Emperor
and entered the Palace since childhood

356
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,020
to study with the Crown Prince.

357
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,140
He is His Majesty’s apple of the eye.

358
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,700
Your Grace, you can’t believe

359
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,060
that Count Cheng’an
will fall in love with you, right?

360
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,380
Everyone, you don’t know

361
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,140
that I happened to meet Count Cheng’an

362
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,780
a few days ago.

363
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,180
We had a great conversation.

364
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,820
He

365
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,300
spoke with fervor and assurance.

366
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,780
Based on how he behaved,
I’m sure he admires me.

367
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,180
Couldn’t he be Count Cheng’an?

368
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,100
I don’t know we’ve met before.

369
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,420
He is really Count Cheng’an.

370
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,220
This is embarrassing now.

371
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,460
Baroness Ban is really not
an ordinary woman.

372
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,180
You don’t care about
that your engagement is broken off.

373
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,540
Now you can even make up

374
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,140
a new marriage out of nothing.

375
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,780
You give yourself too much credit.

376
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,340
Count Cheng’an is mine.

377
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,860
This is going to be interesting.

378
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,100
Count Cheng’an is so handsome.

379
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,660
It’s embarrassing.

380
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,860
I can’t lose to those snobs.

381
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,380
Looks like

382
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,740
I have to use my final move.

383
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,660
Rong Xia.

384
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,540
You claim to be a good example
for all the scholars.

385
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,220
Don’t let me down.

386
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,220
Your Grace, how can you
make up our stories?

387
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,300
Don’t be so stingy.

388
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,380
Could it be

389
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,980
that you have a crush on me?

390
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,340
It’s your honor if I have crush on you.

391
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
Well...

392
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,020
Is it proper?

393
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,140
Count Cheng’an, think about it.

394
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,900
We

395
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,420
gazed at each other affectionately.

396
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,660
It’s beyond words.

397
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,660
I can’t remember at all.

398
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,220
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

399
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,740
The crab feast is ready.

400
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,580
Please take a rest
and move to the banquet hall.

401
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,780
Now her face is totally lost.

402
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,740
It’s too embarrassing to eat crab.

403
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,140
I didn’t invite you.

404
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,500
Why did you come to my mansion?

405
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,620
Greetings to Princess Anle.

406
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,460
His Majesty asked me

407
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,620
to bring the finest
gold chrysanthemum to you.

408
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,100
Thank you.

409
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,540
Why don’t you

410
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,100
stay to taste the crab with us?

411
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
Thank you for your hospitality.

412
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,020
I have something important to do.

413
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Maybe next time.

414
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,940
I will ask someone to
send the flowers to the backyard.

415
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,900
I’m so pissed off.

416
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,420
No. If I leave like this,

417
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,780
those sluts must be happy as hell.

418
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,660
Why is he again?

419
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,860
It’s such a small world.

420
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,700
Since we met,

421
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,580
now I can vent my anger.

422
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,740
Young Master, let’s go.

423
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,940
Don’t be afraid.

424
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Please make way!

425
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,540
What do you want?

426
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,940
You just embarrassed me in the garden.

427
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,220
Now you block my way.

428
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,660
Did I somehow offend you?

429
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,020
I won’t do it again, is that okay?

430
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Glib.

431
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,740
Why do you like to curse people so much?

432
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,620
Shut up!

433
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,020
Well-educated and knowledgeable.

434
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,740
And a role model for all the scholars?

435
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,020
What’s wrong with you?

436
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,900
You just saw a weak woman

437
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,820
being bullied

438
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,660
and you didn’t offer your help.

439
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,900
I even begged you

440
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,260
and you didn’t help me out.

441
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,860
Do you know

442
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,620
saving a life is better than
building a seven-level pageant?

443
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,780
It’s pagoda.

444
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,620
Your Grace.

445
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,500
Today I showed up without notice

446
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,980
and caused inconvenience for you.

447
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,580
I’m sorry about that.

448
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,180
It’s too late.

449
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,060
Actually, I did sense

450
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,380
your trouble today.

451
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,860
It’s just

452
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,620
that I’ve been reading books of sages
since childhood.

453
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,780
I’m not good at lying.

454
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,140
Please forgive me.

455
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,380
Such a dull goose.

456
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,940
Are you really the top talent
in the capital?

457
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,340
It’s just a bubble name.

458
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,060
It’s not as real as your reputation.

459
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,380
What’s my reputation?

460
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,620
A graceful lady.

461
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,980
Bold

462
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,180
and unconstrained.

463
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,780
Step aside! Waste my time
for eating crabs.

464
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,980
Scholars are all jackasses.

465

and escaped from death,

Getting close to the Ban family

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,740
is the first step in my plan.

485
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,980
I will find out what happened back then,

punish the vicious sycophants

509
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,740
Did you find him?

510
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,380
No.

511
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,340
You didn’t?

512
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,140
-What to do?
-We will break in if you don’t come out!

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,500
Let’s go out and fight with them.

Baroness Ban has arrived!

531
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,580
She still got the nerve to come.

532
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,180
The fat crab in autumn
is the finest of the world.

533
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,980
It can be used to gag you.

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,540
Come on, Hua. Have mine.

536
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,660
Thank you.

537
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,420
Miss Xie, be careful.

538
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,060
Don’t crack your teeth.

539
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,340
Baroness Ban, you seem to

540
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,700
have lost some weight these days.

541
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,380
Take care of yourself.

542

<i>Li Xiaoru, Noble Lady in Daye</i>
Don’t hold back if anything bothers you.

543
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,980
Staying angry will hurt your health.

544
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,540
That’s weird. In such a feast,

545
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,540
why are there freeloaders gossiping?

546
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
This is Mr. Li’s daughter, Li Xiaoru.

547
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
We often hang out together.

548
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,860
How can you call her a freeloader?

549
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,060
Maybe it’s because

550
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,500
Miss Li’s clothes are too plain.

551
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,380
I enjoy crowds.

552
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,900
I can’t remember
those who are unremarkable.

553
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,140
Your Grace, you are from a noble family.

554
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,740
Why do you pick on Xiaoru?

555
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,820
Anle, you know what?

556
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,060
These crab-eating tools
are quite useful.

557
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,020
Count Cheng’an is thoughtful.

558
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,980
He sent me the silver tongs
some time ago.

559
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,980
The crab’s shell is thin and crisp.

560
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,540
It’s better to peel it by hand.

561
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,860
I don’t need the crab-eating tools.

562
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,300
If I remember it correctly,

563
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,820
these crabs

564
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,900
were also sent by Count Cheng’an.

565
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,460
She can swagger around

566
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,500
only because

567
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,100
her grandmother is Princess Royal.

568
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,100
Anle.

569
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,100
Grandma missed you a lot these days.

570
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,580
Why don’t you go back to visit her

571
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,620
with me in a few days?

572
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,500
Sure.

573
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,460
Childish.

Why do you do this to me? Ban Huai!

583

Old bastard.

By the grace of God,
His Majesty announces:

00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,100
Marquis Jingting, Ban Huai,

599
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,620
broke the law
and committed disgraceful conduct.

600
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,540
It has been verified.

601
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,340
Today, the title of marquis is removed,
and the salary is withdrawn.

602
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
There is collective punishment
for his family.

603
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,060
Family property will be
handed over to the treasury.

604
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,100
Everyone in the Ban family
is demoted to common people.

605
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,900
Ban Hua, run!

606
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,980
Get her!

607
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,020
Hurry up!

608
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,220
Father!

609
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,940
Father! Mother!

610
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,980
I dreamed that our mansion
got searched and confiscated!

611
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,420
You all got arrested!

612
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,020
Confiscated?

613
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,860
Who got the nerve to do that
to our Ban family?

614
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,860
I mean, you said we were all arrested.

615
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,580
What about you?

616
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,020
I... I ran away.

617
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,580
Run...?

618
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,620
Good, you are indeed my sister.

619
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,380
You ran away alone without me.

620
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,740
That’s not the point.

621
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,500
The point is I dreamed
that Xie Qilin was blind.

622
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,580
Great, that’s my daughter.

623
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,580
You made the Xie family suffer

624
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,940
even in your dream.

625
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,500
Xie Qilin deserves it.

626
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,860
My good girl.

627
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,340
Hua.

628
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,900
You dreamed what you had been

629
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,580
thinking in the daytime.

630
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,940
Don’t be angry.

631
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,020
I will punch him every time I see him.

632
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,460
Hua, don’t worry.

633
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,180
The reality is usually
opposite to the dream.

634
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,220
Mother, my dream of
the broken engagement came true.

635
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,660
If he really becomes blind,

636
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,380
then we...

637
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,260
Don’t be afraid.

638
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,700
Except for His Majesty,

639
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,860
who else is able to hurt our family?

640
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,860
Exactly.

641
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,380
We still got your grandmother.

642
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,300
Even if His Majesty
doesn’t care about me,

643
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,980
he’ll still show some respect
to the Princess Royal.

644
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,660
Don’t be afraid.

645
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,940
Hua.

646
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,140
Why can’t they understand?

647
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,860
If you want to forget someone...

648
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,380
Am I thinking too much about it?

649
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,180
Then you have to find a new one.

650
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,220
Forget it.

651
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,340
-Hua!
-Baroness!

652
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,900
You haven’t had the cubilose!

653
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,740
There are still a lot of it!

654
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,700
Go ahead.

655
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,220
Long live Your Majesty!

00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,620
<i>Emperor Yunqing</i>

657
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,220

You may rise.

658
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,900
In the meeting today, I want to...

659
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,620
Minister Xie.

660
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,660
What’s wrong with your forehead?

661
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,100
Your Majesty, death cannot
atone for my offense!

662
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,900
What offense?

663
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,020
I’m incompetent.

664
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,460
I failed to protect

665
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,380
the plaque of Royal Family you gave me!

666
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
It’s outrageous!

667
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,060
Who stole the plaque?

668
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,220
No one stole it!

669
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,420
It was smashed!

670
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,420
Really?

671
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,980
It was really smashed?

672
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,020
Who is so bold?

673
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,460
Your Majesty, please take a look.

674
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,580
I remember I didn’t smash the plaque.

675
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,020
Who did it?

676
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,300
Ban Huai and his son,
and a bunch of bandits!

677
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,740
<i>Royal Family</i>

678
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,660
Ban Huai, what happened?

679
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,500
Your Majesty.

680
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,300
His son broke off
the engagement with Hua.

681
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,500
He eloped with a brothel woman.

682
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,620
Hua was furious and ran away.

683
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,940
We were worried
that she would go to Xie’s Mansion

684
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,180
and make mistakes.

685
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,180
So I took someone to visit Count Xie.

686
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,860
But Count Xie stayed
behind closed doors.

687
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,180
Your Majesty, it was my fault.

688
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,740
If you want to blame anyone,

689
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,100
just blame Count Xie.

690
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,140
You...! Your Majesty!

691
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,580
All right.

692
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,220
Your Majesty.

693
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,100
Count Cheng’an, you always act fair.

694
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,380
What do you think about this?

695
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,220
Your Majesty.

696
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,740
If I remember it correctly,

697
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,700
it was the Xie family
who proposed the marriage,

698
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,780
and now the Xie family
unilaterally broke it off.

699
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,860
They not only broke their words,

700
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,580
but also hurt Baroness Ban’s reputation.

701
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,460
In the final analysis,

702
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,300
the Xie family is indeed unrighteous.

703
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,420
It’s understandable
that Marquis Jingting and his son

704
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
got furious about it.

705
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,580
Your Majesty, Count Cheng’an is right!

706
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,180
But... But he broke

707
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,860
the plaque you gave me in person!

708
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,740
All right.

709
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,980
I’ve got the answer.

710
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,100
You arranged someone
to keep watch on the Ban family,

711
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,220
and something odd happened.

712
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,300
His Majesty didn’t
punish the Ban family.

713
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,580
Instead, he sent
a carriage of playthings

714
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,500
to Marquis Jingting’s Mansion.

715
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,900
Looks like the Princess Royal
is behind this.

716
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,860
I didn’t expect His Majesty

717
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,340
<i>Wang Qu, Brainman in the Rongs</i>
to still have scruples

718
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
<i>Wang Qu, Brainman in the Rongs</i>
about the Princess Royal.

719
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,980
If it wasn’t for the Princess Royal

720
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,860
and her husband General Ban

721
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
assisting His Majesty all the way,

722
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,740
I’m afraid Daye

723
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,540
would have been taken away by others.

724
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,220
Young Master!

725
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,940
Young Master.

726
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,260
Go ahead. What did you find?

727
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,100
After my public
and private investigation,

728
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,220
I finally found one

729
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,580
old subordinate of the Ban family.

730
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,180
It turns out that the General Ban

731
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
was poisoned and stayed sick
in bed for years.

732
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,340
Did you find out how he was poisoned?

733
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,300
There are rumors but no evidence.

734
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,660
Young Master, do you think

735
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,740
His Majesty has anything to do with it?

736
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,540
If so,

737
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,940
I’m afraid Tiger Tally
can’t get away with

738
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,260
what happened back then.

739
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,180
Here is the imperial decree!

740
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,100
Xie Qilin, the son of Xie Chengyan,

741
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,700
is lascivious.

742
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,500
He broke the royal covenant

743
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,300
and committed an unforgivable sin.

744
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,460
With immediate effect,
he is dismissed as a senior licentiate.

745
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,740
He is not allowed to take the test.
Respect this.

746
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,540
Receive the decree.

747
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

748
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,700
<i>Royal Family</i>

749
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,060
If that dream comes true

750
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,340
and our family gets kicked out
of this house,

751
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,860
let along this mahogany bed,
agarwood chair,

752
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,740
and the shell window...

753
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,300
By that time,

754
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,860
I can’t even afford a piece of cloth.

755
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,620
I have to wear broken linen
with stitches.

756
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,660
If I meet

757
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,300
Xie Wanyu and Shi Feixian...

758
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,980
Sisters, go ahead!

759
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,060
Stop!

760
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,940
What... What are you doing?

761
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,900
What’s wrong, Baroness?

762
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,220
What happened?

763
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,460
Hua!

764
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,620
Our mansion can’t be confiscated.

765
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,420
Otherwise,

766
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,540
I might as well die.

767
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,540
Hua, don’t be upset.

768
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,620
There is a new tea house
in the east of the city.

769
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,100
Why don’t you go to taste the tea?

770
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,380
Yeah, you should go.

771
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,700
I don’t have the mood.

772
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,460
Hua.

773
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,180
Mother gave me the task.

774
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,940
She asked me to take you out to relax.

775
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,980
Otherwise she will deduct
my money this month.

776
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,900
Just go.

777
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Only four hours.

778
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,700
Two hours.

779
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,620
Go to relax yourself, Baroness.

780
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,940
All right.

781
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,060
You are the best.

782
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,740
Come on.

783
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,860
Let’s go.

784
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,740
Where are Father and Mother?

785
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,980
Father...

786
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Listen,

787
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,860
it matters your sister’s marriage.

788
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,620
<i>Count Cheng’an, Rong Xia</i>
Don’t make any mistakes.

789
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,050
<i>Count Cheng’an, Rong Xia</i>
If you screw it up,

790
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,500
<i>Count Cheng’an, Rong Xia</i>
I’ll punish you hard!

791
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,860
They are really
concerned about your dream.

792
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,020
They lost their appetite.
Now they are discussing about it.

793
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,540
Really?

794
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,100
They should study it.

795
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,220
Let’s go.

796
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,260
Go, go, go.

797
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,100
Let’s go.

798
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,860
Hua, you should be happy
being out there.

799
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,100
Shut up.

800
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,540
Look at this clear sky.

801
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,460
The cloudless blue sky
with white clouds.

802
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,820
I’m going back if you keep nagging.

803
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,220
I’ll shut up.

804
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,900
<i>Rong’s Mansion</i>

805
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,660
Rong’s Mansion?

806
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,940
We are not going to the tea house.

807
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,540
How dare you lie to me?

808
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,500
No, no, no.

809
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,420
Hua.

810
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,420
A few days ago, Count Cheng’an

811
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
pleaded for me in court.

812
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,620
Father asked me to
send gifts to thank him.

813
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,180
If you don’t believe me, take a look.

814
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,660
I have the presents ready.

815
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,260
Just for a while, we will leave
after we give him the gifts.

816
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,340
Do it by yourself.

817
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,620
Hua, you dare not go there.

818
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Do you have a crush on Count Cheng’an?

819
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,940
What are you talking about?

820
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,620
Then... You are afraid to be shy

821
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,300
when you see him.

822
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,900
You...!

823
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:44,860
I...!

824
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,620
Hold on! You have a crush
on him if you don’t go!

825
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,060
You have to mess with me, right?

826
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,500
I’ll go.

827
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,820
Please.

828
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
Please wait a moment.

829
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,540
I’ll go to inform Young Master.
