2
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,917
Thanks for today.

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,587
I didn't do anything.

4
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,340
Don't say that.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,266
See you tomorrow, with a smile.

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,659
I'll get going then.

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,757
Look, Heon.

8
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,220
I like Sol-i.

9
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,348
So what?

10
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,772
Don't hurt her feelings.

11
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,848
Heon.

12
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,017
Put it down if you're not buying.

13
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,394
I'm going to.

14
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,522
You and Sol-i fought, didn't you?

15
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,651
-We didn't.
-Then why is she like that?

16
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,444
She's not herself today.

17
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,156
Come on. Be honest with me.

18
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,784
Did you like Sol-i, too,
but played hard to get?

19
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,077
Right?

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,954
You did. You played hard to get.

21
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,498
-That's not it.
-As if. It's written on your face.

22
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,583
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Fine.

23
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,876
Then…

24
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,714
I'll help you solve the issue
if you buy me this.

25
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,759
Forget it.

26
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,653
What do I have to do?

27
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,736
Brother, is this yours?

28
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,824
No.

29
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,624
Oh, I see.

30
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,953
Brother, what are you doing tomorrow?

31
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm not sure. Why?

32
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,500
Coach gave me a day off tomorrow,
so let's have some fun.

33
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,837
Sure.

34
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,382
Ms. Moon.

35
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,217
Hey, Hui-ji.

36
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,428
-The homework printouts are over there.
-Okay.

37
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,447
Gosh, thank you so much.

38
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,032
Thanks!

39
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,784
-I wish you luck.
-Good luck.

40
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,413
-Let's go.
-Can you believe it?

41
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,544
Ha-young, Sol-i!

42
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,046
Come on. Have a seat.

43
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,592
-Right here.
-Ha-young! Sol-i!

44
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,012
-Do you want me to read your horoscopes?
-Horoscopes?

45
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,765
Yes, all I need is your zodiac sign
and that of the person you like.

46
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,726
I checked all 12 months

47
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,353
to cover all the ladies I'm involved with,

48
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,690
and you'll be shocked
to see how insightful she is.

49
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,484
Ha-young, what's your sign?

50
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,445
Scorpio.

51
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
Scorpio.

52
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,702
Oh, and…

53
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,038
His is Cancer.

54
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,956
Got it.

55
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,336
With both signs, Venus is in Aquarius.

56
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,589
That's why the two of you
are drawn to each other

57
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,634
like the north and south pole of a magnet.

58
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,594
A couple can't have a better reading.

59
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,512
-Really?
-Yes.

60
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,390
Ha-young, see? What did I tell you?

61
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,267
I told you she's accurate!

62
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,853
Come on.

63
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,521
See that bread? Go and pay for it.

64
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,401
Sol-i, I know you're interested too.
Buy me some bread and sit.

65
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,278
I'm good.

66
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,546
My sign is Cancer, and the girl I like…

67
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,967
-She's a Scorpio.
-What?

68
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,593
Quiet!

69
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,179
That's exactly what Ha-young mentioned.

70
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,390
What's going on with them?

71
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,936
Is the result the same
when the signs are reversed too?

72
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,437
Of course.

73
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,316
Ma'am,

74
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,653
drink this. Don't choke on your bread.

75
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,655
I'll go now.

76
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,123
Can you believe all these are ours?

77
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,207
Thanks.

78
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,627
Sol-i, are you sure?
Isn't there a boy you like?

79
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,589
No, there isn't.

80
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,766
Mr. Lee, I need a painkiller.
My head hurts so much.

81
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,519
Didn't you come for some yesterday?

82
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,771
I took all of them. Hurry.

83
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,904
Hui-ji, it's not good
to resort to painkillers.

84
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
Did you even sleep?

85
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,616
Lack of sleep can cause headaches too.

86
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,827
I don't care. Just give me a painkiller.

87
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,684
-Hi, Mr. Lee.
-Hi.

88
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,853
Heon.

89
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,813
-Aren't you classmates with Hui-ji?
-Yes.

90
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,191
Do you know if there's
anything troubling her?

91
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,569
Well…

92
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,446
No.

93
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,450
She seems to be having a hard time lately,

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,577
so look out for her.

95
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,829
Okay.

96
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,468
What should we do tomorrow?

97
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,515
What? Sure.

98
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,103
What are you thinking about so hard?

99
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,897
Nothing.

100
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:10,985
Here.

101
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,987
Drink this and cheer up.

102
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,449
Thanks.

103
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,663
Sol-i, are you blind?

104
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,998
Sorry. Are you all right?

105
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,458
Watch where you're going.

106
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,505
-I will. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Is that all you have to say?

107
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,258
Why are you always causing trouble?

108
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,010
Hui-ji, isn't that too harsh?

109
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,512
Stop.

110
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,605
Go in first.

111
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,858
Let's go.

112
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,445
Heon.

113
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,031
What are you doing right now?

114
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,909
Heon.

115
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,955
You're such a jerk.

116
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,448
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL
MID-TERMS, CALCULUS 1

117
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,326
Who's there?

118
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,248
What do you think you're doing, huh?

119
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,210
Who are you?

120
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,423
What on earth? Oh Hui-ji?

121
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,759
What are you doing here?

122
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
You…

123
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,099
-Were you--
-No, sir.

124
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
You little…

125
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,811
What do you mean, "No"?

126
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,813
How will you explain this, then?

127
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,356
How dare you steal exam papers?

128
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,483
-I--
-Explain yourself right away!

129
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,318
It's not what you think, sir.

130
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,362
Hui-ji, what's wrong?

131
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,324
-What's going on?
-It's your student.

132
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,494
I just caught her
stealing these exam papers.

133
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,453
Sorry?

134
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,081
Ms. Moon, it's not true.

135
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,542
Stop lying. I caught you in the act!

136
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,961
Come clean, right now!

137
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,546
I didn't peek.

138
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,465
Ms. Moon, I'm innocent!

139
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,106
Heon, check this out.

140
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,858
I got a love letter.

141
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,319
A love letter, at your age?

142
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,989
I got a lot in kindergarten too.

143
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,576
I heard you get a lot too. Sol-i told me.

144
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,205
Are you and Sol-i close?

145
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,375
Yes, I met her today as well.
We had a chat.

146
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,544
She's totally my type.

147
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,588
Your type?

148
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,383
My dream is to marry
someone as cute as her.

149
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,720
No, I'll just marry her instead.

150
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,766
-No way.
-Who are you to stop me?

151
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,560
Dating and marrying older women
is the trend these days.

152
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,940
Geon, go back to your room and study.

153
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,737
By the way, why are you so prickly today?

154
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,405
Did you perhaps…

155
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,532
have a fight with Sol-i?

156
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
Sol-i seemed gloomy, too.

157
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,123
Heon, the man should always
apologize first when that happens.

158
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
It's mostly the guy's fault.

159
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,338
Who taught you that?

160
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,812
Heon, do you know the term
"Pupils exceed their matters"?

161
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,022
I see you learned a lot from me.

162
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,400
I couldn't be prouder.

163
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,151
"Masters," not "matters."

164
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,446
I know. Don't interrupt your master.

165
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,741
Anyway, what's important now is that…

166
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,662
you'll be playing the piano.

167
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,083
And for Sol-i, of all people.

168
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,378
So? When will she be here?

169
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,546
HA-YOUNG

170
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,131
<i>Sol-i, come to the auditorium.</i>

171
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,853
Ha-young?

172
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,877
Look, guys. It's Oh Hui-ji.

173
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,296
She got caught stealing exam papers.

174
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,964
I was never fond of her.

175
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,467
She pretended she was a model student
all this time.

176
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,011
-She makes me sick.
-She's hungry for grades.

177
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,430
She'll trade her conscience
for a good university.

178
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,599
Will she steal the exam papers
at university too?

179
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,684
Hey! Did you guys see it yourselves?

180
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,853
Did you actually see her stealing them?

181
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,813
No, but we know it's true.

182
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,024
I had enough with these annoying rumors.

183
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,276
Hui-ji, let's go home.

184
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,861
Okay.

185
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,409
-See?
-Unbelievable.

186
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,165
Sol--

187
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,669
Hop on.

188
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,754
Where are we going?

189
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,297
You'll see.

190
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,049
Okay.

191
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,186
Have you tried this before?

192
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,313
Then watch.

193
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,358
Loosen the tension in your wrist
and gently throw the ball.

194
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,318
Give it a try.

195
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,571
Gently, shoot.

196
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,323
That's it! Nice job.

197
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,159
Come on. Faster.

198
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,453
You're great at this.

199
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,039
-Seriously.
-This is fun!

200
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,125
-Right?
-It's so fun.

201
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,799
Shoot!

202
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,510
It won't go in.

203
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,515
I scored again. Look. I'm a natural!

204
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,770
HEAD COACH

205
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,773
<i>Dae-sung, I'll wait at the hospital.
Don't be late.</i>

206
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,026
Incredible! Dae-sung, look.

207
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,778
Right. You're doing great. A few more.

208
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,489
Brother, here's the last one.

209
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,326
-All right.
-Good luck.

210
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,880
How was that? Wasn't it fun?

211
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,215
Yes, it blew away all of my stress.

212
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,885
-Me too. Should we get going then?
-Sure.

213
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,518
PHYSIATRIST

214
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>He shouldn't train for the time being.</i>

215
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,899
<i>He won't be able to compete
with a shoulder like that.</i>

216
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,361
<i>Doctor, is there really no other way?</i>

217
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,118
-Hey, Dae-sung.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

218
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,495
Did you get home safely?
It's raining outside.

219
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,831
I'm fine. I'm almost home.

220
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,916
I had a lot of fun today.

221
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,252
-<i>Thanks.</i>
-So did I.

222
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,714
-I'll see you at school then.
-Sure. Good night.

223
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:40,945

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,878
Heon, where are you going?

225
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,797
-Why?
-Are you going to see Sol-i?

226
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,549
No.

227
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,387
I'm going to see the dog.

228
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,931
The cute neighborhood dog?

229
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,683
Take me with you. Just a second.

230
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,448
Why doesn't he let me see it?

231
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,345
<i>-It's nothing.
-Just sit back down.</i>

232
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,971
<i>I can handle it now.</i>

233
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,641
<i>Heon, can you come with me?</i>

234
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,643
<i>Why are you so dazed?</i>

235
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,229
Sweets are the best cure
when you're depressed.

236
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,773
<i>Because she's talking nonsense.</i>

237
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,483
<i>Will Jin-hwan be all right?</i>

238
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,360
<i>What if she doesn't wake up?</i>

239
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,237
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

240
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>It's okay.</i>

241
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:10,788
